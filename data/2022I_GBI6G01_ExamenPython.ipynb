Data were from the U.S\\n      Department of the Treasury. Interrupted time series were used to measure\\n      associations of the COVID-19 \"shock\" (taken as June 2020 or 6 months after the\\n      first diagnosis of COVID-19 in the US) and volume sales. Negative binomial\\n      regression was used to evaluate associations between volume sales and changes in \\n      community mobility. RESULTS: Within interrupted time series analysis, the shock\\n      of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an initial increase in the number of\\n      little cigars sold by 11.43 million sticks (p<0.01), with no significant\\n      sustained change in trend. The COVID-19 shock was also associated with an initial\\n      increase in large cigar volume sales by 59.02 million sticks, followed by a\\n      subsequent decrease by 32.57 million sticks per month (p=0.005). Every 10%\\n      reduction in mobility to retail stores was significantly associated with reduced \\n      volume sales of little cigars (IRR = 0.84, 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.98) and large cigars\\n      (IRR = 0.92, 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96). Other findings were statistically\\n      non-significant. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was associated with increased volume sales \\n      for cigars and there was a significant association between reduced mobility to\\n      points of sale and reduced cigar volume sales. Intensified efforts are needed to \\n      prioritize evidence-based tobacco prevention and control efforts amidst the\\n      pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: At the six-month mark following the start of the COVID-19\\n      pandemic in the US, we found that the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic was\\n      associated with a statistically significant initial increase in the number of\\n      little and large cigars sold nationwide.These COVID-19 related trends may have\\n      momentarily reversed the long-term declines seen in cigar sales prior to the\\n      pandemic.Intensified implementation of evidence-based tobacco control and\\n      prevention measures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic may help reduce aggregate\\n      tobacco consumption.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.

METHODS: Eight Chinese Winter Olympic bobsleigh athletes (age: 24 [2]\\n      y, body mass: 89 [15] kg, and height: 184 [5] cm) completed a randomized\\n      crossover study with and without HRV biofeedback before a single night\\'s sleep.\\n      HRV biofeedback was provided 35 minutes prior to bedtime in the experimental\\n      condition. The assessment of HRV took place 45 and 10 minutes before bedtime. The\\n      Profile of Mood States questionnaire was completed 50 and 15 minutes prior to\\n      bedtime. Sleep duration and quality were measured through an air-mattress\\n      sleep-monitoring system. RESULTS: Sleep efficiency (P = .020; F = 7.831; CI,\\n      0.008 to 0.072) and the percentage of deep sleep duration increased (P = .013; F \\n      = 10.875; CI, 0.006 to 0.035), while the percentage of light sleep decreased (P =\\n      .034; F = 6.893; CI, -0.038 to -0.002). Presleep HRV biofeedback increased\\n      parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic activity. Mood states of anger (P =\\n      .006, F = 7.573), panic (P = .031, F = 4.288), tension (P = .011, F = 6.284),\\n      depression (P = .010, F = 6.016), fatigue (P = .000, F = 16.901), and total mood \\n      disturbance (P = .001, F = 11.225) were reduced before sleep. CONCLUSION:\\n      Presleep HRV biofeedback improved some measures of autonomic function, mood, and \\n      sleep quality in Chinese Olympic bobsleigh athletes. Presleep HRV biofeedback\\n      provides a practical strategy that may help reduce sleep disturbances during\\n      periods of training and competition.\\nFAU - Li, QinLong\\nAU  - Li Q\\nAD  - Department of Exercise Physiology, Beijing Sport University, Beijing,China.\\nFAU - Steward, Charles J\\nAU  - Steward CJ\\nAD  - Coventry University, Coventry,United Kingdom.\\nFAU - Cullen, Tom\\nAU  - Cullen T\\nAD  - Coventry University, Coventry,United Kingdom.\\nFAU - Che, Kaixuan\\nAU  - Che K\\nAD  - Department of Exercise Physiology, Beijing Sport University, Beijing,China.\\nFAU - Zhou, Yue\\nAU  - Zhou Y\\nAD  - Department of Exercise Physiology, Beijing Sport University, Beijing,China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Int J Sports Physiol Perform\\nJT  - International journal of sports physiology and performance\\nJID - 101276430\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Profile of Mood States\\nOT  - Winter Olympic athletes\\nOT  - autonomic nervous system\\nOT  - sleep efficiency\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 19:42\\nPHST- 2022/01/28 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/09 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/06/19 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 19:42 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1123/ijspp.2022-0037 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Int J Sports Physiol Perform. 2022 Aug 5:1-11. doi: 10.1123/ijspp.2022-0037.\\n\\nPMID- 35931406\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1873-2747 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0361-9230 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 2\\nTI  - Maternal inflammation induces spatial learning and memory impairment in the F1\\n      and F2 generations of mice via sex-specific epigenetic mechanisms.\\nLID - S0361-9230(22)00187-3 [pii]\\nLID - 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2022.08.001 [doi]\\nAB  - Mounting evidence indicates that histone modifications are involved in\\n      aging-associated cognitive decline (AACD) and can be transmitted to offspring\\n      over multiple generations under conditions of stress. Here, we investigated the\\n      effects of maternal sub-chronic inflammation caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\\n      on AACD and histone modifications in the F1 and F2 generations of experimental\\n      mice as well as the potential sex specificity of intergenerational effects. In\\n      brief, F0-generation CD-1 dams were exposed to LPS (50microg/kg) or saline (CON) \\n      during late pregnancy. Subsequently, F1 males and females (at 2 months-of-age)\\n      from the LPS treatment group were mated with non-littermates from the LPS group\\n      or wild-type mice to produce F2 generations of parental- (F2-LPS2), paternal-\\n      (F2M-LPS1) and maternal-origin (F2F-LPS1) mice. Then, CON-F1 males and females\\n      were mated with wild-type mice to generate F2 generations of paternal- (F2M-CON1)\\n      and maternal-origin (F2F-CON1). Next, we evaluated the cognitive ability and\\n      levels of hippocampal H4K12ac and H3K9me3 in the F1 and F2 offspring at 3- and 13\\n      months-of-age. Overall, F1 male and female LPS groups presented with elevated\\n      corticosterone (P < 0.001, P = 0.036, P = 0.025, 0.012, respectively) and\\n      cytokine responses, poorer cognitive performance (all P < 0.05) and H3K9\\n      hypermethylation and H4K12 hypoacetylation in the dorsal hippocampus (all P <\\n      0.05); these issues were carried over to the F2 generation via the parents,\\n      predominantly in the paternal lineage. Moreover, the levels of H3K9me3 and\\n      H4K12ac were significant correlated with cognitive performance (all P < 0.05),\\n      regardless of whether inflammatory insults had been incurred directly or\\n      indirectly. These findings indicated that gestational inflammatory insults in the\\n      F0 generation accelerated AACD in the F2 generation, along with H3K9\\n      hypermethylation and H4K12 hypoacetylation in the hippocampus, and that these\\n      issues were derived from the F1 parents, especially from the F1 fathers.\\n      AVAILABILITY OF DATA AND MATERIALS: The datasets supporting the conclusions of\\n      this article are included within.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

Having Alzheimer\\'s Disease\\n      and Related Dementias (ADRD) brings additional complexities to these patients\\'\\n      EOL care. OBJECTIVES: To examine the Medicare expenditures at the EOL (last\\n      twelve months of life) among beneficiaries having cancer and ADRD versus those\\n      without ADRD. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study used 2004-2016 Surveillance, \\n      Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data. Patient populations were deceased\\n      Medicare beneficiaries with cancer (breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate) and\\n      continuously enrolled for 12 months before death. Beneficiaries with ADRD were\\n      propensity score matched with non-ADRD counterparts. Generalized Estimating\\n      Equation Model was deployed to estimate monthly Medicare expenditures.\\n      Generalized Linear Models were constructed to assess total EOL expenditures.\\n      RESULTS: 86,396 beneficiaries were included (43,198 beneficiaries with ADRD and\\n      43,198 beneficiaries without ADRD). Beneficiaries with ADRD utilized $64,901 at\\n      the EOL, which was roughly $407 more than those without ADRD ($64,901 vs.\\n      $64,494, p=0.31). Compared to beneficiaries without ADRD, those with ADRD had 11%\\n      higher monthly expenditure and 7% higher in total expenditures. Greater\\n      expenditure was incurred on inpatient (5%), skilled nursing facility (SNF)\\n      (119%), home health (42%), and hospice (44%) care. CONCLUSION: Medicare spending \\n      at the EOL per beneficiary was not statistically different between cohorts.\\n      However, specific types of service (i.e., inpatient, SNF, home health, and\\n      hospice) were significantly higher in the ADRD group compared to their non-ADRD\\n      counterparts. This study underscored the potential financial burden and informed \\n      Medicare about allocation of resources at the EOL.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

This study aimed to investigate the safety of CAS without\\n      postdilation regardless of the degree of residual stenosis. METHOD: We\\n      retrospectively investigated 191 patients who underwent transfemoral CAS without \\n      postdilation intendedly. All cases underwent mild predilation and self-expanding \\n      stent implantation. We divided the patients into a residual stenosis >/=40% group\\n      (n=69, 36.1%) and a residual stenosis <40% group (n=122, 63.9%) according to\\n      their final angiography. We compared the procedural (within 30 days after CAS)\\n      and non-procedural (afterward) adverse cardiovascular events and in-stent\\n      restenosis (ISR) between the two groups. We also investigated the incidence of\\n      perioperative hemodynamic depression (HD) between groups and the changes in\\n      residual stenosis over the follow-up time. RESULTS: Patients in the residual\\n      stenosis >/=40% group had a higher preoperative stenosis rate and a greater\\n      proportion of severely calcified lesions than those in the <40% group. There was \\n      one procedural cardiac death (0.5%), five strokes (2.6%), and four myocardial\\n      infarctions (2.1%). A total of 2.9% had stroke or death procedurally in the\\n      residual stenosis >/=40% group and 3.2% in the residual stenosis <40% group\\n      (p=1.000). The median non-procedural follow-up time was 22 months, with a total\\n      of 6 deaths and 4 strokes. The cumulative 2-year death or stroke rate was 6.2%,\\n      with 5.9% in the residual stenosis >/=40% group versus 6.7% in the residual\\n      stenosis <40% group (p=0.507). There were 2 cases of ISR in the residual stenosis\\n      >/=40% group and 3 in the residual stenosis <40% group (p=0.927). The difference \\n      in the peak systolic velocity of the target lesion between groups at 3 months\\n      after CAS was no longer present, and residual stenosis stabilized at 10-20% at 6 \\n      months in both groups. The patients showed an association between increasing HD\\n      incidence and residual stenosis in a significantly graded response (p=0.021).\\n      CONCLUSION: Residual stenosis after carotid stenting without postdilation is not \\n      associated with the risk of postoperative adverse events.

The accessibility to these resources is limited by the\\n      readability level of the article and the literacy level of the population.\\n      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is estimated to affect between 8 and 12 million\\n      people in the United States with greater disease severity among under insured or \\n      un-insured populations. As PAD continues to increase in prevalence, it is\\n      imperative that patients have access to comprehensible patient-centered health\\n      information. This study aims to evaluate the readability of online PAD patient\\n      education materials. METHODS: The search engine Google was utilized to collect\\n      the first 25 patient-accessible online articles pertaining to the search term\\n      \"peripheral artery disease.\" Articles were then categorized by source type:\\n      hospital, professional society, or other. Readability was measured using the\\n      following tests: Automated Readability Index (ARI), Coleman-Liau Index, (CLI)\\n      Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Gunning Fog, Linsear Write Formula, and the\\n      SMOG Index. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis\\n      Software (SAS), with p-values <0.05 being statistically significant. RESULTS:\\n      Twenty-five articles were categorized by source and statistically analyzed. The\\n      average readability of PAD patient education materials was 10.8 and significantly\\n      above the AMA, NIH, and USDHHS recommended reading level of 6th grade.\\n      Readability scores among source categories were not significantly different.\\n      CONCLUSIONS: Commonly available online PAD resources are written at a grade level\\n      above that currently recommended by medical societies. Hospitals, professional\\n      societies, and other stakeholders in PAD patient education should take into\\n      consideration the readability of their materials to make medicine more\\n      accessible. Readable articles may combat historic, and structural racism often\\n      found in our health care system that marginalizes those with lower health\\n      literacy. It is imperative to develop patient education at an appropriate level\\n      to enrich patient autonomy.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

Studies have\\n      shown a limited effect of antiplatelet therapy on ILT size, while the impact of\\n      anticoagulant therapy on ILT is unresolved. This study aims to evaluate an\\n      association between antithrombotic therapy and ILT size assessed with\\n      three-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasound (3D-CEUS) in a cohort of AAA\\n      patients. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 309 patients with small AAAs were \\n      examined with 3D-CEUS. Patients were divided into three groups based on\\n      prescribed antithrombotic therapy: Anticoagulant (N=36), antiplatelet (N=222),\\n      and no antithrombotic therapy (N=51). Patients\\' ILT size was calculated in volume\\n      (ml) and thickness (mm) and compared between the three groups. RESULTS: Patients \\n      on anticoagulants had a significantly lower estimated marginal mean ILT volume of\\n      16ml (SE: +/-3.2) compared with 28 ml (SE: +/-2.7) in the no antithrombotic group\\n      and 30ml (SE: +/-1.3) in the antiplatelet group when adjusting for AAA-volume\\n      (p<.001) and comorbidities (p<.001). In addition, patients on anticoagulant\\n      therapy had significantly lower estimated marginal mean ILT thickness of 10mm\\n      (SE: +/-1.1) compared with 13mm (SE: +/-0.9) in the no antithrombotic group of\\n      and 13mm (SE: +/-0.4) in the antiplatelet group when adjusting for AAA-diameter\\n      (p=.03) and comorbidities (p=.035). CONCLUSIONS: 3D-CEUS is applicable for ILT\\n      assessment and demonstrates that AAA patients on anticoagulant therapy have lower\\n      ILT thickness and volume than AAA patients on antiplatelet therapy and those\\n      without antithrombotic therapy. Causality between anticoagulants and ILT size,\\n      and extrapolation to AAA growth and rupture risk, is unknown and merits further\\n      investigations, to further nuance ultrasound-based AAA surveillance strategy.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

Alkaline lignin is expected to decrease the heavy metal\\n      risk and enhance the P availability in heavy-metal-contaminated soils. A 120-day \\n      incubation study examined the effects of alkaline lignin on Cd, Pb and P\\n      bioavailability and transformation in Cd or Cd/Pb co-contaminated red and\\n      cinnamon soils and elucidated the associated mechanisms. A pot experiment further\\n      tested Cd accumulation in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in the\\n      Cd-contaminated red soil. The amendment of alkaline lignin increased the\\n      concentrations of bioavailable Cd by 13-20% in the acid red soil and 97-107% in\\n      the alkaline cinnamon soil, respectively, being due to the increase of dissolved \\n      organic C concentrations. Meanwhile, it also increased the concentrations of\\n      available P in both soils, Al-P in red soil and Ca2-P in cinnamon soil.\\n      Consequently, alkaline lignin amendment increased lettuce biomass by 8-23% in\\n      shoots and by 56-71% in roots, P uptake by 37-50% in shoots and by 28-62% in\\n      roots, and limited Cd transport from root to shoot which decreased Cd\\n      concentrations by 26% in lettuce shoot (edible part). The results suggest that\\n      alkaline lignin increases plant growth and decreases Cd bioaccumulation in the\\n      shoot through restricting Cd translocation from the root to shoot and increasing \\n      soil P availability but not Cd immobilization, and hence may have potential to\\n      reduce vegetable Cd contamination risk.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

METHODS:\\n      Isolates were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution. Whole\\n      genome and transcriptome sequencing were performed, and data was analysed using\\n      open-source tools. A statistical analysis of changes in expression of >5,500\\n      genes was compared to the expression of PAO1. RESULTS: The high-risk clones ST235\\n      and ST111 were the most prevalent among >90 STs. Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBLs)\\n      genes were detected in 40 isolates. AmpC and MexXY were the most common genes\\n      overexpressed in approximately 50% of the 173 isolates that did not carry MBLs.\\n      Isolates overexpressing pmrA and pmrB, the norspermidine production genes speD2\\n      and speE2, and the operon arnBCADTEF-ugd were noted among strains resistant to\\n      ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam, despite the lack of polymyxin\\n      resistance often associated to increased expression of these genes.\\n      Overexpression of MuxABC-OpmB, OprG, and OprE proteins were associated with\\n      resistance to ceftolozane-tazobactam in addition to the usual genes involved in\\n      cephalosporin, monobactam, and carbapenem resistance. Statistical analysis\\n      identified discrete mutations in ArmZ, OprD, and AmpC that correlated to\\n      antipseudomonal beta-lactam resistance. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa resistance\\n      mechanisms are complex. This analysis suggests the role of multiple genes in\\n      resistance to antipseudomonal beta-lactams, including some not commonly\\n      described.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

Our study aimed to elucidate the relationships between inflammatory\\n      factors and OD in a sample of Omicron-infected patients with a high rate of\\n      vaccination in China. METHODS: The Sniffin\\' Sticks 12-item test (SST-12) was\\n      performed in a cross-sectional study of 148 recovered Omicron-infected patients\\n      to evaluate OD severity. We compared demographic, laboratory, and clinical data. \\n      RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight Omicron-infected patients were enrolled. One\\n      hundred twenty-nine cases of OD were detected. Increased inflammation contributed\\n      to OD severity, especially in the adult group. OD was shown to be aggravated by\\n      an increase in IL-6 levels.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the\\n      application of maternal early warning criteria in the postpartum period and to\\n      generate a preliminary predictive model for severe maternal morbidity and\\n      mortality occurring after delivery hospitalization discharge until 42 days\\n      postpartum. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case control study was conducted from\\n      January 2013 to September 2020. Cases were identified from the electronic medical\\n      record using ICD-10 codes for Centers for Disease Control defined severe maternal\\n      morbidity. Patients meeting criteria for severe maternal morbidity and mortality \\n      from delivery hospitalization discharge until 42 days postpartum were matched for\\n      delivery hospital and year with controls in an approximate 1:2 fashion. The\\n      objective was to identify demographic and clinical risk factors during the\\n      antepartum through postpartum periods for postpartum severe maternal morbidity\\n      and mortality. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to estimate\\n      risks and a receiver operating characteristic curve was derived to evaluate the\\n      model. RESULTS: Ninety cases of postpartum severe maternal morbidity and\\n      mortality were identified that occurred following delivery hospitalization\\n      discharge. These were matched with 175 controls. Women with postpartum severe\\n      maternal morbidity and mortality had more postpartum assessments (mean: 1.7 vs\\n      1.4, p=0.005) and a higher frequency of maternal early warning criteria (58%\\n      [52/90] vs 2% [3/175], p<0.001) preceding the diagnosis of severe maternal\\n      morbidity and mortality than controls. Black women had higher odds of postpartum \\n      severe maternal morbidity and mortality than White women (OR 1.93, 95%CI\\n      1.14-3.27). Women with maternal early warning criteria during postpartum\\n      assessments were more likely to experience subsequent postpartum severe maternal \\n      morbidity and mortality (OR 67.2, 95%CI 21.3-211.6) than women with no maternal\\n      early warning criteria. Although the point estimate was different in Black women \\n      (OR 161.8, 95%CI 8.9->999) than White women (OR 47.9, 95%CI 13.8-167.1), the\\n      effect modification between MEWC and race was not statistically significant\\n      (p=0.93). In a multivariable model, race, body mass index, cesarean, and maternal\\n      early warning criteria at postpartum assessments were associated with subsequent \\n      severe maternal morbidity and mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.905\\n      (95%CI 0.864-0.946). CONCLUSION: Maternal early warning criteria are associated\\n      with increased odds of postpartum severe maternal morbidity and mortality. A\\n      straightforward model that includes race, BMI, cesarean delivery, and the\\n      presence of maternal early warning criteria appears to be a promising tool to\\n      identify those at risk for postpartum severe maternal morbidity and mortality\\n      following delivery hospitalization discharge. This is an important first step in \\n      improving the ability to recognize and respond to conditions preceding postpartum\\n      SMMM.

Women comprise three-quarters of healthcare workers in the\\n      United States, an occupational field among the first to receive the vaccine.\\n      Professional medical and government organizations encouraged shared\\n      decision-making and access to vaccination among those with active reproductive\\n      needs. OBJECTIVE: To characterize information sources used by pregnancy-capable\\n      healthcare workers for information about the COVID-19 vaccines, and to compare\\n      the self-reported \"most important\" source by respondents\\' active reproductive\\n      needs, if any. STUDY DESIGN: This was a web-based national survey of female,\\n      US-based healthcare workers in January 2021. Recruitment was conducted using\\n      social media and subsequent sharing via word of mouth. We classified respondents \\n      into six groups based on self-reported reproductive needs: 1) preventing\\n      pregnancy, 2) attempting pregnancy, 3) currently pregnant, 4) lactating, 5)\\n      attempting pregnancy and lactating, and 6) currently pregnant and lactating. We\\n      provided respondents with a list of information sources (friends, family, OB-GYN,\\n      pediatrician, news, social media, government organizations, their employer, and\\n      \"other\") and asked respondents which source(s) they used when looking for\\n      information about the vaccine, and their most important source. We used\\n      descriptive statistics to characterize the information sources and compared the\\n      endorsement of government organizations and OB-GYN as the most important\\n      information source between reproductive groups using chi-square. Effect size was \\n      calculated using Cramer\\'s V. RESULTS: Our survey had 11,405 unique respondents:\\n      5,846 (51.3%) were preventing pregnancy, 955 (8.4%) were attempting pregnancy,\\n      2,196 (19.3%) were currently pregnant, 2,250 (19.7%) were lactating, 67 (0.6%)\\n      were attempting pregnancy and lactating, and 91 (0.8%) were currently pregnant\\n      and lactating. The most endorsed information sources were government\\n      organizations (88.7%), employers (48.5%), OB-GYN (44.9%), and social media\\n      (39.6%). For the most important information source, the distribution of\\n      respondents endorsing government organizations was different between reproductive\\n      groups (p<0.001), most common among respondents preventing pregnancy (62.6%) and \\n      least common among those currently pregnant (31.5%). We observed an inverse\\n      pattern among respondents endorsing an OB-GYN as the most important source: the\\n      source was most common among currently pregnant respondents (51.4%) and least\\n      common among those preventing pregnancy (5.8%), p<0.001. The difference in\\n      endorsement of social media as an information source between groups was\\n      significant but had a small effect size. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers use\\n      government and professional medical organizations for information. Respondents\\n      attempting pregnancy, pregnant, and/or lactating are more likely to use social\\n      media and an OB-GYN as information sources for vaccine decision-making. This data\\n      can inform public health messaging and counseling for clinicians.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

The objective of this study was to\\n      evaluate the efficacy of a modified COVID-19 VDUS protocol in reducing\\n      sonographer exposure to COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a single center\\n      retrospective review. Subjects who underwent a VDUS under the modified COVID-19\\n      protocol between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, with a confirmed or presumed\\n      COVID-19 diagnosis at the time of VDUS were included. The modified COVID-19\\n      protocol was defined as the ability of the sonographer to terminate the\\n      examination upon detection of an acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The primary \\n      outcome measures were the number of anatomic deep venous segments recorded by the\\n      sonographer, used as a surrogate measure for sonographer exposure time, and the\\n      number of acute DVTs on follow-up examinations in segments not visualized on\\n      index VDUS. RESULTS: One hundred sixty lower extremity venous duplex ultrasounds \\n      (LEVDUS) and 72 upper extremity venous duplex ultrasounds (UEVDUS) were performed\\n      using the COVID-19 protocol. On index VDUS, 27.5% (44/160) of subjects who\\n      underwent LEVDUS and 36.6% (26/72) of subjects who underwent UEVDUS had an acute \\n      DVT. On follow-up imaging 17.9% (7/38) of LEVDUS and 10% (1/10) of UEVDUS\\n      demonstrated a new acute DVT. Malignancy and surgery 30 days prior to imaging\\n      were significantly associated with acute lower extremity DVTs, while mechanical\\n      ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were associated with\\n      acute upper extremity DVTs. On index DUS, there were averages of 10.6 of 14 total\\n      visualized segments on LEVDUS and 6.4 of 10 total segments on UEVDUS. In total\\n      index VDUS, 35.6% of LEVDUS and 78.6% of UEVDUS were abbreviated. Index VDUS that\\n      were positive for acute DVT had significantly fewer visualized segments for both \\n      lower (8.4 vs 11.5, p<0.0001) and upper extremities (4.2 vs 7.6, p<0.0001). On\\n      follow up examination, only 1 out of 8 new acute DVTs occurred in a subject whose\\n      index VDUS was abbreviated, and the corresponding segment not assessed. This\\n      finding did not impact the subject\\'s clinical course. CONCLUSION: The modified\\n      COVID-19 VDUS protocol reduced sonographers\\' potential exposure time to COVID-19.\\n      Additionally, the clinical efficacy was maintained, with no missed DVTs despite\\n      the abbreviation of VDUS examinations.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery.

We sought to investigate the\\n      differences in clinical characteristics and risk factors of symptomatic pulmonary\\n      embolism (SPE) in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in different limbs and\\n      anatomical locations. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted in 1476\\n      patients with acute unilateral lower extremity DVT. Differences of clinical\\n      characteristics and risk factors between left-side and right-side DVT, IVT and\\n      non-IVT, cases with SPE and cases without SPE were compared. Risk factors for SPE\\n      were investigated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: SPE was more\\n      common in right-side DVT patients than left-side DVT patients (13.8% vs 7.0%,\\n      p<0.001). SPE incidence in left IVT, 5.4%, was lower than that in left non-IVT,\\n      right IVT and right non-IVT (12.8%, 10.1%, 16.6%, p<0.001). There was no\\n      difference in SPE incidence among patients with left non-IVT, right IVT and right\\n      non-IVT (p>0.05). In left-side DVT patients, male sex was associated with\\n      increased odds of SPE (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.10-2.85, P=0.02). IVT, surgery and\\n      immobilization were associated with decreased odds of SPE (OR:0.46, 95% CI:\\n      0.28-0.76, p<0.01; OR: 0.55, 95% CI:0.32-0.95, p=0.03; OR: 0.53, 95%\\n      CI:0.32-0.86, p=0.01). In right-side DVT patients, provoked DVT was associated\\n      with decreased odds of SPE (OR:0.50, 95% CI: 0.27-0.93, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Left\\n      IVT is associated with a lower SPE incidence than right-side DVT. Left IVT and\\n      may be a relative protective factor against SPE.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

However, pulmonary fibrosis\\n      (PF) is considered to be the principal drawback that greatly limits its use.\\n      Here, we sought to investigate ability of the neurokinin receptor 1 blocker,\\n      aprepitant, to prevent PF caused by bleomycin. Male adult Wistar rat groups were \\n      given a single intratracheal injection of bleomycin, either alone or in\\n      combination with aprepitant therapy for 3 or 14 days. Collagen deposition and a\\n      rise in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) immunoreactivity in lung\\n      tissue serve as evidence of bleomycin-induced PF. The serum levels of lactate\\n      dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and total antioxidant improved after\\n      aprepitant therapy.Additionally, it reduced the protein expressions of interferon\\n      alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and lung lipid peroxidation. Moreover,\\n      aprepitant treatment led to an increase in the antioxidant indices glutathione,\\n      glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. Aprepitant is postulated to protect against\\n      bleomycin-induced PF by decreasing TGF-beta, phosphorylating Smad3, and\\n      increasing interleukin 37, an anti-fibrotic cytokine, and G Protein-coupled\\n      Receptor Kinase 2. Aprepitant for 14 days considerably exceeded aprepitant for 3 \\n      days in terms of improving lung damage and having an anti-fibrotic impact.

METHODS: A total of\\n      544 coke oven workers and 238 healthy controls were recruited. Peripheral blood\\n      was collected from the subjects, genomic DNA was extracted, leukocyte TL was\\n      detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and fifteen\\n      polymorphisms of eight miRNAs were genotyped by flight mass spectrometry.\\n      RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that the peripheral blood DNA TL in the\\n      exposure group was shorter than that in the control group (P < 0.001).\\n      Generalized linear model found that COEs-exposure [beta (95%CI) = -0.427 (-0.556,\\n      -0.299), P < 0.001], genotype CC+CT for miR-612 rs1144925 [beta (95%CI) = -0.367 \\n      (-0.630, -0.104), P = 0.006], and the interaction of miR-181B1 rs12039395 TT\\n      genotype and COEs-exposure [beta (95% CI) = 0.564 (0.108, 1.020), P = 0.015] were\\n      associated with the shortened TL. CONCLUSION: COEs-exposure and miR-612 rs1144925\\n      TT could promote telomere shortening in coke oven workers. The interaction of\\n      miR-181B1 rs12039395 TT genotype and COEs-exposure could protect telomere.

We conducted a retrospective chart\\n      review of all patients admitted for acute type B PAU or IMH in a tertiary\\n      referral hospital. Indications to intervention were \"complicated\" (rupture,\\n      impending rupture, malperfusion) or \"high risk for unfavorable outcome\"\\n      (refractory hypertension and/or pain despite best medical treatment, morphologic \\n      aortic evolution, transition to a new aortic syndrome, or increase in IMH/PAU\\n      depth >5 mm) during the acute/subacute phase. The primary outcomes were overall\\n      mortality, aortic-related mortality, and freedom from intervention.\\n      Time-dependent outcomes were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox proportional\\n      hazards models were used to identify predictors of intervention and mortality.\\n      There were 54 acute aortic syndromes, 37 PAUs and 17 IMHs. Mean age was 69+/-14\\n      years and 33 patients (62.2%) were male. Six (11.5%) patients had complicated\\n      aortic syndromes and underwent urgent repair. Two (3.7%) additional patients\\n      developed an impending rupture during the acute phase. Eleven (21.1%) patients\\n      were classified as at \"high risk\" during the initial hospitalization. Overall, 22\\n      (40.7%) patients required an aortic intervention during the initial admission\\n      (n=16, 72.7% during the acute phase; n=6, 27.3% during the subacute phase).\\n      In-hospital mortality was 5.5% (1 PAU and 2 IMH), and was aorta-related in all\\n      cases. For IMH, disease extension in >3 aortic zones (HR 1.94, 95%CI 1.17-32.6;\\n      P=.038) and presence of ulcer-like projections (ULPs) (HR 1.23, 95%CI 1.02-9.41; \\n      P=.042) were associated with the need for intervention. There were no\\n      aortic-related deaths or intervention during the chronic phase. PAU width > 20 mm\\n      (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.07-16.08; P=.014), PAU depth >15 mm (HR 6.74, 95%CI 1.31-34.18;\\n      P=021), PAU depth/total aortic diameter >0.3 (HR 4.31, 95%CI 1.17-20.32; P=.043),\\n      and location at the level of the paravisceral aorta (HR 2.24, 95%CI 1.23-4.70;\\n      P=.035) were significantly associated with need for intervention. Six additional \\n      (16.2%) PAUs required intervention during the chronic phase owing to PAU growth. \\n      Maximum aortic diameter >35 mm was significantly associated with intervention (HR\\n      1.45, 95%CI 1.00-2.32; P=.037). Acute symptomatic type B IMHs and PAUs are\\n      characterized by a high risk of complications during the first month from\\n      presentation. Morphologic features associated with intervention were IMH with\\n      ULPs or extension in more than 3 aortic zones, as well as PAUs with depth>15 mm, \\n      width >20 mm, or depth/aortic diameter ratio>0.3. A strict follow-up protocol or \\n      consideration for early intervention within 30 days from presentation should be\\n      taken into account for these high-risk patients. During the chronic phase imaging\\n      follow-up is particularly important for PAUs in order to identify progression to \\n      saccular aneurysms.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

The aim of this study is to\\n      evaluate the surgical outcomes of our cohort of patients with VP shunt for iNPH, \\n      comparing the cohort of patients showing objective improvement with those\\n      improving only at subjective assessments. METHODS: We performed a retrospective\\n      analysis. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 included patients with\\n      an improvement at objective evaluations after CSF tap test; group 2 included\\n      patients showing only a subjective improvement. We compared the surgical outcomes\\n      of the two groups. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included in our analysis: \\n      17objective responders (group 1) and 11subjective responders (group 2). Clinical \\n      and radiological characteristics were similar. The only significant difference\\n      was the baseline Berg Balance Scale, which was lower in the objective responders \\n      (p=0.0015). At 3 months after surgery and at last follow-up, there was no\\n      difference in terms of surgical outcomes between the two groups. However, in the \\n      group of subjective responders a continuous improvement for incontinence and gait\\n      was more frequently observed (p=0.04 and p<0.001 respectively). CONCLUSION: The\\n      surgical outcomes after VP shunt were similar between the two groups, with a more\\n      favorable trend in terms of symptoms improvement for subjective responders. The\\n      subjective assessment seems to be an important factor to consider in preoperative\\n      evaluations.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we utilize real-world variability in the timing of\\n      angiographic follow-up to characterize the timeline of aneurysm occlusion\\n      following treatment with the Pipeline Embolization Device. MATERIALS AND METHODS:\\n      All aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device at our institution\\n      between 2011 and 2020 were screened. Non-saccular or ruptured aneurysms were\\n      excluded. Aneurysm occlusion status and time since treatment were recorded for\\n      each follow up angiogram. Aneurysm occlusion was characterized using Kaplan-Meier\\n      and Cox proportional hazards analysis after censoring at last follow up or\\n      subsequent treatment. RESULTS: 290 aneurysms in 222 patients were analyzed. The\\n      median time of observed aneurysm occlusion was 7.5 months, and the overall rate\\n      of aneurysm occlusion was 77.9%. Larger aneurysms demonstrated longer median time\\n      to occlusion and lower rate of aneurysm occlusion (p=0.029). There were no\\n      observed differences in the timeline of occlusion for aneurysms treated with a\\n      single PED or multiple PEDs (p=0.889), or without or with adjunctive coiling\\n      (p=0.771). CONCLUSION: Aneurysms treated with PED had median time to observed\\n      occlusion of 7.5 months. Larger aneurysms occluded more slowly than smaller\\n      aneurysms following flow diversion. The number of PEDs deployed or the use of\\n      adjunctive coiling did not affect the timeline or likelihood of aneurysm\\n      occlusion. These findings may guide optimum timing of follow up after treatment\\n      with PED.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The optimal timing for\\n      revascularization for these patients remains unclear. METHODS: From 1994-2015, 91\\n      MMD patients presented with signs and symptoms of an acute ischemic stroke with\\n      diffusion restriction correlate on MRI, and these patients were subdivided into\\n      those who underwent early revascularization (<90 days from last stroke), versus\\n      those who underwent delayed revascularization (>/=90 days after last stroke),\\n      based on evidence that most neurological recovery after stroke occurs during the \\n      first three months. Perioperative and long-term outcomes were compared between\\n      the two surgical cohorts. RESULTS: 27 patients underwent early revascularization,\\n      and 64 patients underwent delayed revascularization. Patients who underwent early\\n      revascularization had a statistically higher rate of perioperative stroke\\n      (p=0.04) and perioperative mortality (p=0.03), and overall complication rate\\n      (p=0.049). At last follow up of 5.2 +/- 4.3 years, patients who underwent delayed\\n      revascularization had a lower mortality rate (p=0.01) and a lower overall\\n      post-operative stroke incidence (p=0.002). As a function of time, MMD patients\\n      undergoing delayed revascularization had a statistically higher length of\\n      stroke-free survival (p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: MMD patients who present with\\n      ischemic stroke are more likely to have perioperative strokes, overall\\n      perioperative complications, worse long-term mortality rates, and lower rates of \\n      stroke-free survival if revascularization surgery occurred within 90 days of last\\n      stroke.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Our hypothesis was that\\n      clinical outcomes would not be impacted by improvement in ER using a lateralized \\n      glenosphere design. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 55 patients with\\n      preoperative ER < 0 degrees who underwent primary RSA for RC pathology with\\n      lateralized glenosphere. Pre- and postoperative physician-reported ER was blindly\\n      measured using a videographic review of patients externally rotating their arm at\\n      the side. Patients were evaluated using 5 different patient reported outcome\\n      score thresholds, measured at 12 months postoperatively: 1) Minimal Clinical\\n      Difference (MCID) for ASES (i.e. >/= 20 point increase); 2) MCID SST (>/= 2.4\\n      increase); 3) VAS pain > 0; 4) mean ASES (>/= 75); and 5) mean SST (>/= 6.8),\\n      each of which was used to stratify the patients into two groups 1) greater than\\n      or equal (>/=) vs. less than (<) the threshold. This resulted in 5 different\\n      evaluations comparing the group >/= to the one < the threshold for any difference\\n      in postoperative ER or preoperative factors, including Hamada and Goutallier\\n      scores. RESULTS: Regardless of the measured outcome, there was no difference in\\n      either postoperative physician- or patient-reported ER between patients who\\n      achieved scores higher or lower than the thresholds. Both Hamada and Goutallier\\n      score distribution were not different between groups across all the evaluated\\n      outcomes. Patients who achieved the MCID for ASES had worse preoperative VAS pain\\n      (7 vs 4, p = 0.011) and SST (1 vs 3, p = 0.020) scores. Across all outcome\\n      thresholds, except MCID for SST, pain reduction (DeltaVAS) was significantly more\\n      pronounced in patients exceeding the thresholds. Improved forward flexion rather \\n      than ER was observed in those who achieved the ASES (160 degrees vs 80 degrees , \\n      p=0.020) and SST MCID (150 degrees vs 90 degrees , p=0.037). Finally, patients\\n      who exceeded the thresholds experienced higher satisfaction rates. CONCLUSION:\\n      Improvement in ER does not appear to impact patient-reported outcome measures,\\n      including ASES and SST in patients with preoperative ER < 0 degrees undergoing\\n      RSA with a lateralized glenosphere. Patients with more severe pain and worse\\n      function at baseline experience less postoperative pain and clinically\\n      significant improvement in their reported outcomes.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.\\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Eighteen patients who\\n      presented with glenohumeral instability were prospectively enrolled and received \\n      both MRI and CT within 1 week of each other. The MRI included an additional\\n      sequence (VIBE) which underwent post-processing for reformations (Figure 1a). The\\n      addition of a VIBE protocol, on average is an addition 4 to 4.5minutes in the\\n      scanner. CT data also underwent 3D post-processing (Figure 1b) and therefore each\\n      patient had four imaging modalities (2D CT, 2D MRI, 3D CT reformats, and 3D MRI\\n      reformats). Each sequence underwent the following measurements from two separate \\n      reviewers: glenoid defect, glenoid defect percent, humeral defect, humeral defect\\n      percentage (Figure 2a and 2b), and evaluation of glenoid track and version.\\n      Paired t-tests were used to assess differences between imaging modalities and chi\\n      squared for glenoid track. Intra-observer and inter-observer reliability were\\n      evaluated. Bland-Altman tests were also performed to assess the agreement between\\n      CT and MRI. In addition, we determined cost of each imaging modality at our\\n      single institution. RESULTS: 3D MRI measurements for glenoid and humeral bone\\n      loss measurements were comparable to 3D CT (Table 1). There were no significant\\n      differences for glenoid defect size and percentage, or humeral defect size and\\n      percentage (P>0.05) (Table 2). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated strong\\n      agreement with small measurement errors for 3D CT and 3D MRI percentage glenoid\\n      bone loss (Figure 3). There was also no difference in evaluation for determining \\n      on vs off track between any of the imaging modalities. Inter- and intra-rater\\n      reliability was good to excellent for all CT and MRI measurements (r >= 0.7).\\n      CONCLUSION: 3D MRI measurements for bone loss in glenohumeral instability through\\n      utilization of VIBE sequence were equivalent to 3D CT. At our institution, the\\n      costs of MRI with 3D reconstruction was 1.67x cheaper than MRI and CT with 3D\\n      reconstructions. 3D MRI may be a useful adjuvant to standard MRI sequences to\\n      allow concurrent soft tissue and accurate assessment of glenoid and humeral bone \\n      loss in glenohumeral instability.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

METHODS: We analyzed data on\\n      shoulders with an erosion-type glenoid defect. Participants were patients who\\n      underwent computed tomography to evaluate new bone formation after ABR performed \\n      from 2004 to 2021 and were followed for a minimum of 2 years. We investigated the\\n      factors influencing new bone formation, in particular the presence of an\\n      intraoperative bone fragment, and the influence of new bone formation and its\\n      size on postoperative recurrence. RESULTS: A total of 100 shoulders were\\n      included. The mean glenoid defect size was 10.1+/-6.3% (range, 1.2% to 31.5%).\\n      New bone formed postoperatively in 15 shoulders (15.0%) and was seen in\\n      significantly more shoulders with an intraoperative bone fragment (11/18, 61.1%) \\n      than in those without a fragment (4/82, 4.9%; p<0.001). Recurrence occurred in 22\\n      shoulders (22.0%), and the rate of recurrence was not different between shoulders\\n      with new bone formation (3/15, 20.0%) and without new bone formation (19/85,\\n      22.4%; p=0.999). Among the 15 shoulders with new bone formation, the size of the \\n      new bone fragments relative to glenoid width was less than 5% in 2 shoulders, 5% \\n      to less than 7.5% in 8 shoulders, 7.5% to less than 10% in 3 shoulders, and 10%\\n      or more in 2 shoulders; in all 3 shoulders with postoperative recurrence, the\\n      relative size was less than 7.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Even in shoulders with an\\n      erosion-type glenoid defect, new bone may form after ABR, especially in shoulders\\n      with an intraoperative bone fragment. However, new bone formation does not\\n      decrease the rate of postoperative recurrence.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.\\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

Pitchers were divided into high consistency(HiCon) and\\n      low consistency(LoCon) groups based on the absolute center deviation of each\\n      pitcher\\'s pitch to the center of the pitchers mean pitch location. 95% confidence\\n      ellipses with major and minor radii were constructed, while kinematics and\\n      kinetics were compared. RESULTS: HiCon pitchers had decreased lead hip flexion at\\n      elbow extension(40+/-12 degrees vs. 52+/-13 degrees respectfully, p=0.008) while \\n      at foot contact, decreased back hip extension(1+/-10 degrees vs. 10+/-13 degrees \\n      respectfully, p=0.038) and increased back hip internal rotation(9+/-15 degrees\\n      vs. -2+/-15 degrees respectfully, p=0.043). LoCon pitchers achieved maximum lead \\n      hip flexion earlier(61.3+/-23.2% vs. 75.8+/-15.1% respectfully, p=0.039). A\\n      multi-regression model could predict 0.49 of variance in pitch location\\n      consistency using kinematic inputs. CONCLUSION: Pitchers who differ in pitch\\n      location consistency outcomes do not appear to demonstrate physiologically unsafe\\n      kinematics.

Both may be affected by the morphology\\n      of the scapula. The purpose of this study was to define anteroinferior (a) and\\n      posteroinferior (p) Relevant Scapular Neck Offset (RSNO) and to examine the\\n      hypothesis that pRSNO is significantly smaller than aRSNO, and influences Rigid\\n      Body Motion (RBM). Adapting glenosphere implantation strategies may therefore be \\n      of value. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this computer model study (Blueprint software,\\n      Imascap) we used deidentified CT scans of 22 patients (11 male/female; mean age: \\n      72.9 years) with massive cuff tears without joint space narrowing. Eight RSA\\n      glenoid configurations were tested with a constant neck-shaft angle (145 degrees \\n      ). Two base plate (BP) types (25mm; 25mm+3mm lateralized) and four glenospheres\\n      (GS) (36 mm; 36mm+2mm eccentricity; 39mm; 39mm+3mm) were used. RSNO was defined\\n      as the standardized measurement of the horizontal distance from the inferior\\n      extent of the GS to the bony margin of the scapula after BP positioning (flush to\\n      inferior glenoid extent; neutral position: 0 degrees inclination; 0 degrees\\n      version; both software computed). RESULTS: There was a highly significant\\n      difference between pRSNO and aRSNO for both genders (p<0.00001). pRSNO was always\\n      smaller than aRSNO. pRSNO was strongly correlated with external rotation (ERO:\\n      0.84) and extension (EXT: 0.74) and moderately correlated with global ROM (GROM: \\n      0.68). There was a moderately strong correlation between aRSNO and internal\\n      rotation (IRO: 0.69). pRSNO was strongly correlated with aRSNO, EXT, ERO, IRO,\\n      adduction (ADD) and GROM (0.82; 0.72; 0,8; 0.71; 0.82; 0.76) in females and with \\n      EXT and ERO (0.82; 0.89) in males. The median pRSNO allowing for at least 45\\n      degrees ERO/40 degrees EXT was 14.2mm for males and 13.8mm for females. For all\\n      patients and models, pRSNO>/=14mm increased EXT, ERO, and GROM significantly\\n      compared to pRSNO<14mm (p<0.00001). The combination of lateralization and\\n      inferior overhang (eccentricity) lead to the most significant increase of pRSNO\\n      for each GS size (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION: This is one of the first RSA modeling\\n      studies evaluating non-arthritic glenoids of both genders. The lateral scapular\\n      extent to glenoid relationship is asymmetric. pRSNO is always smaller than aRSNO \\n      for both genders, and was a critical variable for EXT and ERO demonstrating\\n      additional strong correlation with aRSNO, IRO, ADD and GROM in females.\\n      pRSNO>/=14mm was a safe value to prevent friction-type impingement. Combining\\n      increased glenosphere size, lateralization and inferior overhang gives the best\\n      results in this computer simulated setting.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.\\n      Published by Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, the optimal glenoid inclination is\\n      unknown. Therefore, a cadaveric shoulder simulator with 3D human motion specific \\n      to rTSA was used to study joint contact and muscle forces as a function of\\n      glenoid component inclination. METHODS: Eight human cadaver shoulders were tested\\n      before and after rTSA implantation. Scapular plane abduction kinematics from\\n      control subjects and those with rTSA drove a cadaveric shoulder simulator with 3D\\n      scapulothoracic and glenohumeral motion. Glenoid inclination varied from -20\\n      masculine to +20 masculine. Outputs included compression, superior-inferior (S/I)\\n      shear, and anterior-posterior (A/P) shear forces from a 6 degree of freedom\\n      loadcell in the joint, and deltoid and rotator cuff muscle forces. Data were\\n      evaluated with statistical parametric mapping and t-tests. RESULTS: Inferior\\n      glenoid inclination (-) reduced S/I shear by up to 125% relative to superior\\n      inclination, with similar compression to the neutral condition (0 degrees ).\\n      Superior inclinations (+) increased the S/I shear force by approximately the same\\n      magnitude, yet decreased compression by 25% in the most superior inclination (+20\\n      degrees ). There were few differences in deltoid or rotator cuff forces due to\\n      inclination. Only the middle deltoid decreased by approximately 7% for the most\\n      inferior inclination (-20 degrees ). Compared to native shoulders, the neutral (0\\n      degrees ) rTSA inclination showed reduced forces of 30-75% in the anterior\\n      deltoid, and a trend toward decreased forces in the middle deltoid. Force demands\\n      on the rotator cuff varied as a function of elevation, with a trend toward\\n      increased forces in rTSA at peak glenohumeral elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Inferior\\n      inclination reduces superior shear forces, without influencing compression.\\n      Superior inclination increased S/I shear, while decreasing compression, which may\\n      be a source of component loosening and joint instability after rTSA. Inferior\\n      inclination of the rTSA glenoid may reduce the likelihood of glenoid loosening by\\n      reducing the magnitude of cyclic shear and compressive loading during arm\\n      elevation activities, although this may be altered by specific-subject body\\n      habitus and motion. These factors are especially important in revision rTSA or\\n      glenoid bone grafting where there is already a 3-fold increase in glenoid\\n      baseplate loosening versus primary rTSA.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Spanish Scleroderma Registry data were analyzed\\n      to determine the demographic characteristics of patients with SSc, and logistic\\n      regression was used to identify cancer risk factors. SIRs with 95% confidence\\n      intervals (CIs) relative to the general Spanish population were calculated.\\n      RESULTS: Of 1930 patients with SSc, 206 had cancer, most commonly breast, lung,\\n      hematological, and colorectal cancers. Patients with SSc had increased risks of\\n      overall cancer (SIR 1.48, 95% CI 1.36-1.60; P<0.001), and of lung (SIR 2.22, 95% \\n      CI 1.77-2.73; P<0.001), breast (SIR 1.31, 95% CI 1.10-1.54; P=0.003), and\\n      hematological (SIR 2.03, 95% CI 1.52-2.62; P<0.001) cancers. Cancer was\\n      associated with older age at SSc onset (odds ratio [OR] 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.03;\\n      P<0.001), the presence of primary biliary cholangitis (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.18-4.68;\\n      P=0.015) and forced vital capacity <70% (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.24-2.70; P=0.002). The \\n      presence of anticentromere antibodies lowered the risk of cancer (OR 0.66, 95% CI\\n      0.45-0.97; P=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Spanish patients with SSc had an increased\\n      cancer risk compared with the general population. Some characteristics, including\\n      specific autoantibodies, may be related to this increased risk.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

Here, we \\n      present a large-scale analysis of handedness, as measured by self-reported\\n      direction of hand preference, and its variability related to brain structural and\\n      functional organization in the UK Biobank (N=36,024). A multivariate machine\\n      learning approach with multi-modalities of brain imaging data was adopted, to\\n      reveal how well brain imaging features could predict individual\\'s handedness\\n      (i.e., right-handedness vs. non-right-handedness) and further identify the top\\n      brain signatures that contributed to the prediction. Overall, the results showed \\n      a good prediction performance, with an area under the receiver operating\\n      characteristic curve (AUROC) score of up to 0.72, driven largely by resting-state\\n      functional measures. Virtual lesion analysis and large-scale decoding analysis\\n      suggested that the brain networks with the highest importance in the prediction\\n      showed functional relevance to hand movement and several higher-level cognitive\\n      functions including language, arithmetic, and social interaction. Genetic\\n      analyses of contributions of common DNA polymorphisms to the imaging-derived\\n      handedness prediction score showed a significant heritability (h(2)=7.55%, p\\n      <0.001) that was similar to and slightly higher than that for the behavioural\\n      measure itself (h(2)=6.74%, p <0.001). The genetic correlation between the two\\n      was high (rg=0.71), suggesting that the imaging-derived score could be used as a \\n      surrogate in genetic studies where the behavioural measure is not available. This\\n      large-scale study using multimodal brain imaging and multivariate machine\\n      learning has shed new light on the neural correlates of human handedness.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

Brain microvessels support adequate blood circulation to maintain\\n      normal physiological function, therefore, brain microcirculation disorder is an\\n      important therapeutic target for various brain diseases. However, the role of\\n      Xueshuantong (XST) injection composed of saponins from P. Notoginseng (PNS) in\\n      the amelioration of cerebral microcirculation disorder is unclear. AIMS OF THE\\n      STUDY: Cerebral microcirculation disorder and inflammation play a vital role in\\n      stroke. Capillary endothelial cells and adjacent tight junctions are fundamental \\n      to the structure and function of cerebrovascule. XST injection has been used\\n      clinically in the treatment of stroke, but no studies have reported its\\n      indication in cerebral microcirculation disorder. This study is to explore the\\n      action and mechanism of XST injection in the alleviation of cerebral\\n      microcirculation disorder in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion\\n      (MCAO/R) rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCAO/R rats and LPS-induced bEnd.3cells\\n      were employed for the investigation of effect and mechanism of XST injection.\\n      Brain damages were evaluated by neurobehavioral assessment, 2, 3,\\n      5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining\\n      (H&E), and Nissl staining. Morphology and density changes of cerebral\\n      microvessels were monitored by immunohistochemistry. Cell permeability was\\n      detected by measurement of trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and\\n      sodium fluorescein (NaF) leakage. The mRNA and protein expressions of\\n      inflammatory cytokines, tight junction proteins, adhesion molecules, janus kinase\\n      2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), inhibitor\\n      of NF-kappaB (IkappaB), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-jun N-terminal\\n      kinase (JNK) in brain microvessels and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced\\n      bEnd.3cells were measured by real-time PCR and western blot, respectively.\\n      RESULTS: XST injection at 48mg/kg significantly improved the neurological damage,\\n      inflammatory infiltration, and microvessel morphology, and increased microvessel \\n      density in brain of MCAO/R rats. The endothelial permeability was significantly\\n      mitigated by XST in LPS-induced bEnd.3cells. Meanwhile, the tight junction\\n      proteins such as zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) and occludin were elevated remarkably in\\n      brain microvessel of MCAO/R rats and LPS-induced bEnd.3cells. Moreover, the\\n      expression of inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6,\\n      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),\\n      cycloocygenases 2 (COX-2), vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), matrix\\n      metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 were inhibited by XST. In addition, XST\\n      suppressed the phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, IkappaB, NF-kappaB and JNK, which \\n      could be abolished by anisomycin, the JNK agonist. CONCLUSION: XST injection\\n      improved cerebral microvescular structure damage and dysfunction in MCAO/R rats\\n      through inhibiting inflammation activated by JNK mediated JAK2/STAT3 and\\n      NF-kappaB signaling pathways. The novel findings may provide theoretical basis\\n      for the clinical application in the treatment of cerebral microcirculation\\n      disorder.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

The rheological,\\n      morphological, barrier, optical, anti-fogging, and antioxidant properties of\\n      pullulan-based composite films doped with BC and FA were investigated. The\\n      rheological results showed that all film-forming solution was pseudoplastic fluid\\n      and its viscosity increased with the increase of BC content. An appropriate BC\\n      (2%) and FA were uniformly dispersed in pullulan to form uniform and dense\\n      composite films. With the increase of BC content, the roughness and opacity of\\n      composite films increased while their UV-vis barrier performance was improved by \\n      incorporating BC and FA. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer analysis\\n      demonstrated that hydrogen bond interactions among pullulan, BC, and FA were\\n      found, and incorporating BC could increase the crystallinity of the composite\\n      films, thus enhancing their mechanical, barrier, hydrophobic, and thermal\\n      stability properties. Pullulan-based composite films incorporated with 2%BC and\\n      FA (P-BC2-FA) showed better mechanical properties, water, oxygen, and carbon\\n      dioxide barrier performances, and its water contact angle value also increased\\n      compared with control, respectively. P-BC2-FA film showed superior anti-fogging\\n      and antioxidant activities. These results indicate that the P-BC2-FA films are\\n      expected to be a potential target of bioactive packaging.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

To expand on this line of\\n      work, we evaluated how juvenile exposure to chronic variable stress (CVS) or the \\n      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) influences conditioned\\n      taste aversion (CTA) learning in adulthood. To do this, in Experiment 1, we\\n      examined how adolescent CVS alone (postnatal day [PND] 35-48), or with prenatal\\n      stress (PNS) history (PNS+CVS), influenced the acquisition and extinction of CTA \\n      in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. Specifically, at PND70+ (adulthood), rats were\\n      presented with 0.15% saccharin followed by an intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of \\n      lithium chloride (LiCl) to induce visceral malaise. A total of four saccharin\\n      (conditioned stimulus) and LiCl (unconditioned stimulus) pairings occurred across\\n      the CTA acquisition phase. Next, saccharin was presented without aversive\\n      consequences, and intake was measured across consecutive days of the extinction\\n      phase. No differences in body weight gain across the experimental days, rate of\\n      CTA acquisition, or extinction of CTA, were observed among the experimental\\n      groups (control, n = 7; CVS, n = 12; PNS+CVS, n = 9). In Experiment 2, we\\n      evaluated if early-life FLX exposure alters CTA learning in adulthood.\\n      Specifically, adolescent stress naive male and female rats received FLX (0 or 20 \\n      mg/kg/i.p) once daily for 15 consecutive days (PND35-49). During antidepressant\\n      exposure, FLX decreased body weight gain in both male (n = 7) and female rats (n \\n      = 7), when compared to respective controls (male control, n = 8; female control, \\n      n = 8). However, juvenile FLX exposure decreased body weight-gain in adult male, \\n      but not female, rats. Lastly, adolescent FLX history had no effect on CTA\\n      acquisition or extinction in adulthood (PND70), in neither male nor female rats. \\n      Together, the data indicate that juvenile FLX exposure results in a long-term\\n      decrease of body weight-gain in a male-specific manner. Yet, independent of sex, \\n      neither early-life stress nor FLX exposure alters CTA learning in adulthood.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to assess the\\n      incidence, mortality, and diagnostics of AMI by also including patients diagnosed\\n      post-mortem. METHODS: This retrospective study comprised patients diagnosed with \\n      AMI either alive or post-mortem between 2006-2015 within a health care district\\n      serving 1.6 million inhabitants. Key exclusion criteria were venous or\\n      non-obstructive ischaemia. RESULTS: A total of 470 patients were included in the \\n      study of which 137 (29%) were diagnosed post-mortem. Most common misdiagnoses on \\n      those not diagnosed alive were unspecified infection (n=19, 17%),\\n      gastrointestinal bleeding (n=13, 11%), and ileus (n=13, 11%). Of those diagnosed \\n      alive (n=333), 187 (56%) underwent active surgical or endovascular treatment.\\n      During the 2006-2015 period, the overall incidence rate of AMI was 3.05 (95% CI\\n      2.78-3.34)/100 000 person-years and 26.66 (95% CI 24.07-29.45) for those aged\\n      70-years or more, respectively. The mean autopsy rate during the study period was\\n      29% for the overall population (32% during 2006-2010 and 25% during 2011-2015)\\n      and 18% for those aged 70-years or more. Overall, 90-day mortality was 83% in all\\n      patients. 90-day mortality decreased, being 87% during the first period\\n      (2006-2010) and 79% during the second period (2011-2015) (p = .029), while at the\\n      same time proportion of patients diagnosed alive rose from 71% to 80% (p = .030) \\n      and number of endovascular revascularisations rose from 1% to 5% (p = 0.022).\\n      CONCLUSIONS: Significant proportion of patients with AMI are not diagnosed alive,\\n      which is reflected in the mortality rates. Post-mortem examinations and autopsy\\n      rate data continue to be key factors in epidemiological studies on AMI.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

The\\n      objective of this study was to determine social and unintentional injury risks\\n      reported by these families. METHODS: This cross-sectional study surveyed a\\n      convenience sample of guardians of patients 1-5 years of age presenting to our\\n      pediatric urgent care, 9/10/21-2/25/22. Outcomes were the number of reported\\n      social and unintentional injury risks. Predictors and covariates included child\\n      and parent demographic characteristics and a neighborhood socioeconomic\\n      deprivation index. Chi square, student\\'s t-test, Pearson\\'s Correlation tests, and\\n      multinominal regression, were used. RESULTS: A total of 273 guardians (and\\n      children) were included; 245 of guardians (89.7%) were female; 137 (50.2%) of\\n      included children identified as Black. Approximately 60% reported >/=1 social\\n      risk; 31.5% reported >/=3. Approximately 90% reported >/=1 unintentional injury\\n      risk; 57.9% reported >/=3. There were significant associations between social\\n      risk presence and Black race, public/no insurance, and neighborhood deprivation\\n      (all p<0.05). There were no significant associations between unintentional injury\\n      risks and assessed predictors. Black guardians were more likely than those of\\n      other races to report a greater number of social risks (AOR 2.90, 95% CI 1.50,\\n      5.58 for >/=3 vs. 0 risk). Children with public/no insurance compared to private \\n      insurance were more likely to experience a greater number of social risks (AOR\\n      3.34, 95% CI 1.42, 7.84 for >/=3 vs. 0 risks). CONCLUSIONS: Many presenting to\\n      pediatric urgent cares experience social and unintentional injury risks. Risk\\n      identification may guide equitable responses.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

This study was designed to assess outcomes of TJA in PWID and \\n      to describe factors associated with improved PJI outcomes among PWID. METHODS: A \\n      retrospective matched cohort study was performed using a 1:4 match among those\\n      with and those without a history of injection drug use (IDU) undergoing TJA.\\n      Demographic, surgical, and outcome variables were compared in multivariate\\n      logistic regressions to determine PJI predictors. Kaplan-Meier analyses were\\n      constructed to characterize the difference in survival of patients who did not\\n      have PJI or undergo joint explantation between PWID and the matching cohort.\\n      RESULTS: PWID had a 9-fold increased risk of PJI compared to the matched cohort\\n      (OR 9.605, 95% CI 2.781-33.175, p<0.001). Ten of 17 PWID who used injection drugs\\n      within 6 months of primary TJA (active use) had a PJI, while 7 of 41 PWID who did\\n      not have active use developed a PJI. Of PWID with PJI, treatment failure was seen\\n      in 15 of 17, while in patients who did not have an IDU history, 5 of 8 with PJI\\n      had treatment failure. CONCLUSION: Injection drug use is a significant risk\\n      factor for PJI following TJA. Future work investigating the effect of a\\n      multidisciplinary support team to assist in cessation of injection drug use and\\n      to provide social support may improve outcomes and reduce morbidity in this\\n      vulnerable population.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

Since\\n      the genetic deletion of mPGES-1 abolished 6-OHDA-induced PGE2 production and\\n      6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo models,\\n      mPGES-1 enzyme has the potential to be an important target for PD therapy. In the\\n      present work, we investigated whether a small organic molecule as mPGES-1\\n      inhibitor could exhibit the neuroprotective effects against 6-OHDA-induced\\n      neurotoxicity in in vitro and in vivo models. For this research goal, a new\\n      series of arylsulfonyl hydrazide derivatives was prepared and investigated\\n      whether these compounds may protect neurons against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity \\n      in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Among them, compound 7s (MPO-0144) as a\\n      mPGES-1 inhibitor (PGE2 IC50 = 41.77 nM; mPGES-1 IC50 = 1.16 nM) exhibited a\\n      potent neuroprotection (ED50 = 3.0 nM) against 6-OHDA-induced in PC12 cells\\n      without its own neurotoxicity (IC50 = >10 muM). In a 6-OHDA-induced mouse model\\n      of PD, administration of compound 7s (1 mg/kg/day, for 7days, i.p.) ameliorated\\n      motor impairments and dopaminergic neuronal damage. These significant biological \\n      effects of compound 7s provided the first pharmacological evidence that mPGES-1\\n      inhibitor could be a promising therapeutic agent for PD patients.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Time to\\n      device activation was 25.0, 32.0, and 37.5 days for abdominal, sub-inguinal, and \\n      conversion groups, respectively (p<0.01). There were no bowel or bladder injuries\\n      and no PRB herniation in any group; however, there were five instances of pump\\n      migration superiorly, all in the sub-inguinal or conversion groups (p=0.05).\\n      CONCLUSIONS: The sub-inguinal approach to PRB placement during AUS is safe and\\n      can be successfully completed over 90% of the time. However, it is not faster\\n      than the abdominal approach to PRB placement and it is associated with an\\n      increased risk of pump migration, though the latter may be confounded by the\\n      sub-dartos pouch for pump placement that was used in all sub-inguinal cases.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

METHODS: The Premier Hospital Database was\\n      queried to identify all robotic and laparoscopic radical prostatectomies from\\n      January 2015 - March 2020 with length of stay >/=1 day. \"Opioid-sparing\" was\\n      defined as absence of intravenous opioid use after post-operative day 0 and\\n      absence of oral opioid use throughout admission. Comparisons were made between\\n      opioid-sparing and non-opioid-sparing prostatectomy. Logistic multivariable\\n      regression was used to identify predictors of opioid-sparing prostatectomy.\\n      RESULTS: A total of 62,660 patients were included, of whom 14,806 (23.6%)\\n      underwent opioid-sparing prostatectomy. Opioid-sparing prostatectomy was\\n      associated with older age (65 vs. 63 years, p<0.01), white vs. black race (76.3% \\n      vs. 73.4%, p<0.01), high-volume surgeons (75.2% vs. 70.0%, p<0.01), and use of\\n      intravenous ketorolac (62.2% vs. 48.0%, p<0.01), intravenous acetaminophen (32.5%\\n      vs. 30.1%, p<0.01), and liposomal bupivacaine (5.4% vs. 4.9%, p<0.01). On\\n      multivariable regression, ketorolac was the strongest predictor of opioid-sparing\\n      prostatectomy (odds ratio: 1.86, 95% confidence interval: 1.79 - 1.93, p<0.01),\\n      and black race was predictive of non-opioid sparing prostatectomy (odds ratio:\\n      0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.71 - 0.80, P<0.01). Ketorolac was not associated\\n      with increased risk of postoperative bleeding (0.3% vs. 0.3%, p=1.0) or dialysis \\n      requirement (<0.1% vs. <0.1%, p=0.91). CONCLUSION: Opioid-sparing radical\\n      prostatectomy was feasible and associated with administration of each of the\\n      non-opioid pain medications assessed. Ketorolac was the strongest predictor of\\n      opioid-sparing prostatectomy and was not associated with increased risk of\\n      bleeding or dialysis.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Indigenous Australians suffer disproportionately\\n      from diabetes-related complications. Exploring ethnic variation in disease is\\n      important for equitable distribution of resources and may lead to identification \\n      of ethnic-specific modifiable risk factors. Existing DR prevalence studies\\n      comparing Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians have shown conflicting\\n      results. METHODS: This study was conducted following Joanna Briggs Institute\\n      guidance on systematic reviews of prevalence studies (PROSPERO ID:\\n      CRD42022259048). We performed searches of Medline (Ovid), EMBASE, and Web of\\n      Science until October 2021, using a strategy designed by an information\\n      specialist. We included studies reporting DR prevalence among diabetic patients\\n      in Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian populations. Two independent\\n      reviewers performed quality assessments using a 9-item appraisal tool.\\n      Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed using double arcsine\\n      transformation and a random-effects model comparing Indigenous and non-Indigenous\\n      subgroups. RESULTS: Fifteen studies with 8219 participants met criteria for\\n      inclusion. The Indigenous subgroup scored lower on the appraisal tool compared to\\n      the non-Indigenous subgroup (mean score 50% vs 72%, p=0.04). In the unadjusted\\n      meta-analysis, DR prevalence in the Indigenous subgroup (30.2% [95%CI:\\n      24.9-25.7]) did not differ significantly (p=0.17) from the non-Indigenous\\n      subgroup (23.7% (95%CI: 16.8-31.4]). After adjusting for age and for quality, DR \\n      prevalence was higher in the Indigenous subgroup (p-values<0.01), with prevalence\\n      ratio point estimates ranging between 1.72-2.58, depending on the meta-regression\\n      model. For the secondary outcomes, prevalence estimates were higher in the\\n      Indigenous subgroup for diabetic macular oedema (8.7% vs 2.7%, p=0.02) and\\n      vision-threatening DR (8.6% vs 3.0%, p=0.03), but not for proliferative DR (2.5% \\n      vs 0.8%, p=0.07). CONCLUSION: Indigenous studies scored lower for methodological \\n      quality, raising the possibility that systematic differences in research\\n      practices may be leading to underestimation of disease burden. After adjusting\\n      for age and for quality, we found a higher DR prevalence in the Indigenous\\n      subgroup. This contrasts with a previous review which reported the opposite\\n      finding of lower DR prevalence using unadjusted pooled estimates. Future\\n      epidemiological work exploring DR burden in Indigenous communities should aim to \\n      address methodological weaknesses identified by this review.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

Polymeric micelles based on\\n      poly(N-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylamide)-block-poly(N-2-benzoyloxypropyl\\n      methacrylamide) (p(HPMAm)-b-p(HPMAm-Bz)) of which 10% of the chains was\\n      functionalized with biotin at the p(HPMAm) terminus were prepared using a solvent\\n      extraction method. The size of the micelles when loaded with a hydrophobic agent,\\n      namely paclitaxel (a clinically used cytostatic drug) or curcumin (a compound\\n      with multiple pharmacological activities), was around 65nm. The biotin decoration\\n      allowed the binding of the micelles to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads which\\n      occurred within 10min and reached a binding efficiency of 90+/-6%. Drug release\\n      in different media was studied after the magnetic separation of micelles bound to\\n      the streptavidin-coated beads, by determination of the released drug in the media\\n      as well as the retained drug in the micellar fraction bound to the beads. The in \\n      vitro release of paclitaxel and curcumin at 37 degrees C in PBS, PBS containing\\n      2% v/v Tween 80, PBS containing 4.5% w/v bovine serum albumin, mouse plasma, and \\n      whole mouse blood was highly medium-dependent. In all media studied, paclitaxel\\n      showed superior micellar retention compared to curcumin.

This\\n      study tested the hypothesis that protocolized care improves survival by reducing \\n      multi-organ dysfunction prior to orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) or\\n      durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). METHODS: We developed a\\n      protocolized Recognize/rescue-Optimization-Stabilization-Exit/de-Escalation\\n      (ROSE) framework for CS due to ESHF. Six-month survival pre-ROSE (2014-2018) and \\n      post-ROSE (2018-2021) were compared. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment\\n      (SOFA) score was calculated as a measure of multi-organ dysfunction pre-MCS and\\n      pre-\"Exit\" therapy (OHT, LVAD or recovery). RESULTS: 101 consecutive patients\\n      with CS due to ESHF who were deteriorating on inotropes (INTERMACS 1 or 2) were\\n      included (63 in Pre-ROSE and 38 in Post-ROSE). The proportions of patients who\\n      died on support (26 (41%) vs 11 (29%), p=0.213) or bridged to \"Exit\" therapy were\\n      comparable between Pre- and Post-ROSE: OHT (28 (44%) vs 21 (55%), p=0.292);\\n      durable LVAD (8 (13%) vs 5 (13%), p=0.947); or recovery (1 (2%) vs 1 (3%),\\n      p=0.715). SOFA score prior to \"Exit\" therapy was higher Pre-ROSE compared to\\n      Post-ROSE (4 (2-7) vs 2 (1-5), p=0.012). Six-month survival from initial MCS (71%\\n      vs 41%, p=0.004) and in patients who underwent \"Exit\" therapy (100% vs 71%,\\n      p=0.001) were higher Post-ROSE vs Pre-ROSE, respectively. Higher pre-\"Exit\" SOFA \\n      score was associated with 6-month survival. None of the patients with Pre-\"Exit\" \\n      SOFA score>/=9 survived at 6months. CONCLUSION: Protocolization of CS care in\\n      ESHF improved six-month survival by improving multi-organ dysfunction (SOFA\\n      score) prior to OHT and LVAD implant.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

We assessed and compared the prevalence\\n      and predictors of MINOCA in a large cohort of HCM and FD patients. METHODS: In\\n      this multicenter, retrospective study we enrolled 2870 adult patients with HCM\\n      and 267 with FD. The only exclusion criterion was documented obstructive coronary\\n      artery disease. MINOCA was defined according to guidelines. For each patient we\\n      collected clinical, ECG and echocardiographic data recorded at initial\\n      evaluation. RESULTS: Overall, 36 patients had MINOCA during a follow-up period of\\n      4.5+/-11.2years, MINOCA occurred in 16 patients with HCM (0.5%) and 20 patients\\n      with FD (7.5%; p<0.001). The difference between the 2 groups was highly\\n      significant, also after adjustment for the main clinical, ECG and\\n      echocardiographic variables (OR 6.12;95%CI:2.80-13.3;p<0.001). In the FD\\n      population MINOCA occurred in 17 out of 96 patients with left ventricle\\n      hypertrophy (LVH, 17.7%) and in 3 out of 171 patients without LVH (1.7%; OR\\n      12.0;95%CI 3.43-42.3;p<0.001). At multivariable analysis, voltage criteria for\\n      LVH at ECG (OR 7.3;95%CI 1.93-27.7;p=0.003) and maximal LV wall thickness at\\n      echocardiography (OR 1.15; 95%CI 1.05-1.27;p=0.002) maintained an independent\\n      association with MINOCA. No major significant differences were found in clinical,\\n      ECG and echocardiographic findings between HCM patients with or without MINOCA.\\n      CONCLUSIONS: MINOCA was rare in HCM patients, and 6-fold more frequent in FD\\n      patients. MINOCA may be considered a red flag for FD and aid in the differential \\n      diagnosis from HCM.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In \\n      this study, we explored the effect of empagliflozin on vascular atherosclerosis\\n      after removing the effect of diabetes. METHODS: The interaction between SGLT2\\n      inhibitor and the AMPK(Adenosine 5\\'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase)\\n      signal pathway to attenuate atherosclerosis was studied in both spontaneously\\n      atherosclerotic mice in vivo and oxidized low-density lipoprotein(ox-LDL) induced\\n      macrophage inflammation model in vitro. In vivo experiment the aorta tree and\\n      aortic valve area were stained with oil red, and the level of inflammatory\\n      factors in the diseased tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Meanwhile, \\n      serum was collected to detect the levels of inflammatory factors. In vitro\\n      experiment, the RAW264.7 cell line was selected and ox-LDL was used to induce the\\n      release of proinflammatory factors, and different doses of empagliflozin were\\n      added. The phagocytosis of macrophages to ox-LDL density lipoprotein, and the\\n      expression of inflammatory factors at the protein and RNA levels were measured.\\n      RESULTS: Empagliflozin reduced the area of atherosclerotic plaque and macrophage \\n      infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques, decreased the expression of inflammatory\\n      factors in local plaque tissues and serum of APOE(-/-) mice fed with high-fat\\n      diet. Empagliflozin can improve the protein expression level of p-AMPK affected\\n      by ox-LDL in cell and reduce the gene expression level of inflammatory factors\\n      and protein expression level of NF-kappaB, thus playing an anti-atherosclerosis\\n      role. CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin improves energy metabolism and reduces the\\n      expression of inflammatory factors by activating AMPK. As empagliflozin inhibits \\n      atherosclerosis progression, it may be of use in prevention of cardiovascular\\n      diseases.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

The initial\\n      results showed that the compound in question presents no anxiolytic-like or\\n      myorelaxant effects, despite reducing locomotor activity in the animals at all\\n      doses tested. In addition, the lowest dose increased the latency to onset of the \\n      first epileptic seizure, and the time to death. In addition to decreasing the\\n      mortality percentage in mice submitted to the pilocarpine model. In this same\\n      model, pretreatment with the lowest dose of the compound decreased the\\n      hippocampal concentrations of thiobarbituric acid and nitrite, and partially\\n      restored striatal concentrations of noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin. Taken\\n      together, the results suggest that trans,trans-farnesol presents a central\\n      depressant effect which contributes to its antiepileptic action which, in turn,\\n      seems to be mediated by the antagonism of muscarinic cholinergic receptors,\\n      reduction of oxidative stress. and modulation of noradrenaline, dopamine and\\n      serotonin concentrations in the central nervous system.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

Petunidin\\n      3-O-[rhamnopyranosyl-(trans-p-coumaroyl)]-5-O-(beta-D-glucopyranoside) (Pt3R5G)\\n      isolated and purified from Lycium ruthenicum Murray, which exhibits highly\\n      efficient antioxidant activity and specific anticancer effects, is the flavonoids\\n      compound. We aimed to study the effect of Pt3R5G on CC cells and elucidate the\\n      potential underlying mechanisms. MAIN METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured by\\n      the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and\\n      colony formation assays. Cell cycle, cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species\\n      (ROS) analysis were performed by flow cytometry. RNA-sequencing was performed to \\n      elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms. The lipid peroxidation level of\\n      cells was detected by malondialdehyde (MDA) assay. The mitochondrial morphology\\n      of cells was inspected using a transmission electron microscope. Additionally, we\\n      overexpressed SLC7A11 to perform rescue experiments. In vivo, xenograft mice\\n      assay was performed to verify the effect of Pt3R5G on the growth of colon cancer.\\n      KEY FINDINGS: Pt3R5G reduced the cell activity by blocking the cell cycle in\\n      G0/G1 phase, inducing the apoptosis and ferroptosis in RKO cells. The\\n      overexpressed of SLC7A11, a significantly down-regulated expression gene caused\\n      by Pt3R5G, rescued the cell proliferation inhibition and ferroptosis process.\\n      Furthermore, Pt3R5G inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. Our study suggests that \\n      Pt3R5G inhibits RKO cell proliferation through mainly reducing ferroptosis by\\n      down-regulated SLC7A11. SIGNIFICANCE: As a potential therapeutic drug, Pt3R5G\\n      showed efficient anticancer activity through a variety of pathways.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

However, despite the multiple\\n      benefits of exercise and good sleep quality, less is known about the correlation \\n      between physical activity (PA) and sleep quality (SQ) on postural control and\\n      brain activation under dual-task performance. This study aimed to analyze the\\n      correlation between PA level and SQ with postural control performance and\\n      hemodynamic response in the prefrontal cortex during the DT performance in young \\n      adults. Thirty-four healthy young adults (mean age +/- SD=22.91 +/- 3.90 years)\\n      participated in this study, and they performed a single-task and cognitive and\\n      motor DT using their smartphones. Postural control was assessed using a force\\n      plate to record the center of pressure (CoP) data (total excursion of CoP (TOTEX \\n      CoP), displacements of the CoP in anterior-posterior (CoP-AP) and medial-lateral \\n      (CoP-ML) directions, mean total velocity displacement of CoP (MVELO CoP), mean\\n      displacement velocity of CoP in anterior-posterior (MVELO CoP-AP) and\\n      medial-lateral (MVELO CoP-ML) directions, amplitude of CoP in anterior-posterior \\n      (A-AP) and medial-lateral (A-ML) directions, and 95% confidence ellipse sway area\\n      (CEA)). The hemodynamic response was measured by the oxyhemoglobin and\\n      deoxyhemoglobin concentrations using the functional near-infrared spectroscopy.\\n      The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index and International Physical Activity\\n      Questionnaire-Short Form questionnaires assessed SQ and level of PA,\\n      respectively. Results indicated a positive correlation between SQ and cognitive\\n      DT cost for CoP-ML (rs=0.422, p=0.013), MVELO CoP-ML (rs=0.422, p=0.013) and A-ML\\n      (rs=0.579, p < 0.001). There were no significant relations between the other\\n      outcomes (p > 0.05). In conclusion, poor sleep quality was associated with a\\n      worse postural control performance in CoP-ML, MVELO CoP-ML and A-ML parameters\\n      under cognitive dual-task conditions. The differences found in the postural\\n      control and hemodynamic response during dual-task performance do not correlate\\n      with physical activity level.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

Aggregates of needle-shaped crystalline \\n      nanostructures were confirmed by FE-SEM and TEM analysis. Well-defined rings in\\n      the SAED patterns corroborated the polycrystalline nature of the HAPnps.\\n      Individual elements present in the HAPnps were attested by the specific signals\\n      for Ca, P, and O in the EDS and XPS analyses. The distinct peaks observed in the \\n      XRD spectrum matched well with the HAP hexagonal patterns with a mean crystallite\\n      size of 55.04nm. The FTIR study unveiled the coating of the nanoparticles with\\n      the biomolecules from Acacia falcata leaves. The suspension HAPnps exhibited\\n      polydispersity (0.446) and remarkable stability (zeta potential: - 31.9mV) as\\n      evident from DLS studies. The pore diameter was 25.7nm as obtained from BET\\n      analysis, suggesting their mesoporous nature. The HAPnps showed the cytotoxic\\n      effect on A549 lung and MDA-MB231 breast carcinoma cell lines, with an IC50 value\\n      of 55mug/mL. The distortion of the cell membrane and cell morphology, along with \\n      the chromatin condensation and cell necrosis on treatment with HAPnps were\\n      detected under fluorescence microscopy post acridine orange/ethidium bromide dye \\n      staining. This study reports the anti-cancerous potential of non-drug-loaded\\n      plant-mediated HAPnps.

Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are two pharmacological agents \\n      commonly used to treat of this infection. However, they are accompanied by some\\n      side effects. Therefore, the identifying of new drugs with low toxocytosis seems \\n      to be a matter of vital importance. Quinolones are DNA replication inhibitors,\\n      exerting inhibitory effects against many pathogens, including bacteria,\\n      mycoplasma, and protozoa. Given the importance of quinolones and their efficacy, \\n      the present in vitro study was conducted to investigate the antiparasitic\\n      activities of new quinolones (NFQ-2, NFQ-5, and NFQ-6) containing nitrofuran\\n      moiety against T. gondii. To this end, Vero cells were incubated with various\\n      concentrations of new quinolones and pyrimethamine (positive control) to\\n      determine their viability. Subsequently, they were infected with T. gondii (RH\\n      strain) and then subjected to drug treatment. The obtained IC50 values were 3.60,\\n      4.84, 5.59, 3.44 and 2.75mug/mL for NFQ-2, NFQ-5, NFQ-6, ciprofloxacin and\\n      pyrimethamine, respectively. The CC50 values for the NFQ-2, NFQ-5, and NFQ-6 were\\n      25.20, 29.89, and 28.43mug/mL, indicating the selectivity indexes more than 5 for\\n      these compounds. The anti-Toxoplasma efficiency was determined by evaluating\\n      infection index, number and size of plaques, and T. gondii intracellular\\n      proliferation. As the results indicated, the administration of new quinolone\\n      derivatives resulted in the reduction of intracellular proliferation, infection\\n      index, and the number and size of plaques in comparison to uninfected treated\\n      cells (P<0.05). The results were indicative of a considerable synergetic effect\\n      when each of the derivatives was used in combination with pyrimethamine, compared\\n      to when used alone. Based on our results, the nitrofuran-derived quinolones can\\n      be considered as new leads for the design of new anti-Toxoplasma agents.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

METHODS: We identified 10,342 patients with acute\\n      hematochezia (CODE BLUE-J study) admitted to 49 hospitals in Japan. Of these,\\n      6,270 patients who underwent a colonoscopy within 120 h were included in this\\n      study. Inverse probability of treatment weighting method was used to adjust for\\n      baseline characteristics among early (</=24 h; n=4,133), elective (24-48 h;\\n      n=1,137), and late (48-120 h; n=1,000) colonoscopy. The average treatment effect \\n      was evaluated for outcomes. The primary outcome was 30-day rebleeding. RESULTS:\\n      The early group had a significantly higher rate of stigmata of recent hemorrhage \\n      (SRH) identification and a shorter length of stay (LOS) than the elective and\\n      late groups. However, the 30-day rebleeding rate was significantly higher in the \\n      early group than in the elective and late groups. Interventional radiology\\n      (IVR)/surgery requirement and 30-day mortality did not significantly differ among\\n      the groups. The interaction with heterogeneity of effects was observed between\\n      early/late colonoscopy and shock index (shock index <1: OR, 2.097; shock index\\n      >/=1: OR, 1.095; P for interaction=0.038) and performance status (PS) (PS 0-2:\\n      OR, 2.481; PS >/=3: OR, 0.458; P for interaction=0.022) for 30-day rebleeding.\\n      Early colonoscopy had a significantly lower IVR/surgery requirement in the shock \\n      index >/=1 cohort (OR, 0.267; 95% CI, 0.099-0.721) compared with late\\n      colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Early colonoscopy increased the rate of SRH\\n      identification and shortened LOS, but involved an increased risk of rebleeding\\n      and did not improve mortality and IVR/surgery requirement. Early colonoscopy\\n      benefited particularly patients with shock index >/=1 or performance status >/=3 \\n      at presentation.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

With osteopathic enrollment increasing, we\\n      assessed the osteopathic versus allopathic composition of the radiologist\\n      workforce. METHODS: Linking separate Medicare Doctors and Clinicians Initiative\\n      databases and Physician and Other Supplier Files from 2014 through 2019, we\\n      assessed (descriptively and using multivariate panel logistic regression\\n      modeling) individual and practice characteristics of radiologists who\\n      self-reported medical degrees. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2019, as the number of\\n      osteopathic radiologists increased 46.0% (4.7% to 6.0% of total radiologist\\n      workforce), the number of allopathic radiologists increased 12.1% (representing a\\n      relative workforce decrease from 95.3% to 94.0%). For each year since completing \\n      training, practicing radiologists were 3.7% less likely to have osteopathic\\n      (versus allopathic) degrees (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96 per year, P < .01).\\n      Osteopathic radiologists were less likely to work in urban (versus rural) areas\\n      (OR = 0.95), and compared with the Midwest, less likely to work in the Northeast \\n      (OR = 0.96), South (OR = 0.95), and West (OR = 0.94) (all P < .01). Except for\\n      cardiothoracic imaging (OR = 0.78, P = .24), osteopathic radiologists were more\\n      likely than allopathic radiologists to practice as general (rather than\\n      subspecialty) radiologists (range OR = 0.37 for nuclear medicine to OR = 0.65 for\\n      neuroradiology, all P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Osteopathic physicians represent a\\n      fast-growing earlier-career component of the radiologist workforce. Compared with\\n      allopathic radiologists, they more frequently practice as generalist\\n      radiologists, in rural areas, and in the Midwest. Given recent calls for greater \\n      general and rural radiology coverage, increasing osteopathic representation in\\n      the national radiologist workforce could improve patient access.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 American College of Radiology.

NO-donors like PETN are\\n      strong vasodilators and protect the endothelium. Recently, we demonstrated in a\\n      randomized controlled pilot-study a 38% relative risk reduction for the\\n      development of fetal growth restriction or perinatal death, following\\n      administration of PETN to pregnant women at risk, identified by impaired uterine \\n      perfusion at mid gestation. Results of this mono-center study retrieved the\\n      hypothesis that PETN might have an effect in pregnancies with compromised\\n      placental function the sense of secondary prophylaxis. OBJECTIVE: To test the\\n      hypothesis that the NO-donor PETN reduces fetal growth restriction and perinatal \\n      death in pregnant women with impaired placental perfusion at mid gestation in a\\n      multicenter trial. STUDY DESIGN: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,\\n      placebo controlled trial with two parallel groups pregnant women presenting with \\n      a mean uterine artery Pulsatility Index >95th percentile at 19+0 to 22+6 weeks of\\n      gestation were randomized to Pentalong(R) 50mg or placebo twice daily.\\n      Participants were assigned to high or low risk according to their medical history\\n      before randomization was performed block-wise with a fixed block length\\n      stratified by center and risk group. The primary efficacy endpoint was the\\n      composite outcome of perinatal death or development of fetal growth restriction. \\n      Secondary endpoints were neonatal and maternal outcome parameters. RESULTS:\\n      Between August 2017 and March 2020 317 participants were included in the study\\n      and 307 were analyzed. The cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was 41.1% \\n      in the PETN group and 45.5% in the placebo group, (unadjusted RR 0.90, 95%CI\\n      0.69-1.17; adjusted RR 0.90, 95%CI 0.69-1.17; p=0.43). Secondary outcomes like\\n      preterm birth (unadjusted RR 0.73, 95%CI 0.56-0.94; adjusted RR 0.73, 95%CI\\n      0.56-0.94; p=0.01) and pregnancy induced hypertension (unadjusted RR 0.65, 95%CI \\n      0.46-0.93; adjusted RR 0.65, 95%CI 0.46-0.92; p=0.01) were reduced. CONCLUSION:\\n      Our study failed to show an impact of PETN on the development of fetal growth\\n      restriction and perinatal death in pregnant women with impaired uterine perfusion\\n      at mid gestation. PETN significantly reduced secondary outcome parameters like\\n      the incidence of preterm birth and pregnancy induced hypertension in these\\n      pregnancies.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

STUDY DESIGN: This planned\\n      secondary analysis of a comparative effectiveness trial of two transvaginal\\n      apical suspensions (NCT01802281) defined surgical failure as either re-treatment \\n      of prolapse, recurrence of prolapse beyond the hymen, or bothersome prolapse\\n      symptoms. Baseline clinical and sociodemographic factors for eligible\\n      participants receiving the randomized surgery (N=173) were compared across\\n      categories of failure (</= 1 year, >1 year, no failure) with rank-based tests.\\n      Factors with adequate prevalence and clinical relevance were assessed for\\n      minimally adjusted bivariate associations using piecewise exponential survival\\n      models adjusting for randomized apical repair and clinical site. The\\n      multivariable model included factors with bivariate p<0.2, additional clinically \\n      important variables, apical repair and clinical site. Backward selection\\n      determined final retained risk factors (p<0.1) with statistical significance\\n      evaluated by Bonferroni correction (p<0.005). Final factors were assessed for\\n      interaction with type of apical repair at p<0.1. Association is presented by\\n      adjusted hazard ratios and further illustrated by categorization of risk factors.\\n      RESULTS: In the final multivariable model, body mass index (BMI) (increase of 5\\n      kg/m(2): adjusted hazard ration (aHR) 1.7, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.3,\\n      2.2, p<0.001) and duration of prolapse symptoms, (increase of 1 year: aHR 1.1,\\n      95% CI 1.0, 1.1, p<0.005) were associated with composite surgical failure, where \\n      rate of failure was 2.9 and 1.8 times higher in obese and overweight than\\n      normal/underweight women (95% CI 1.5, 5.8 and 0.9, 3.5) and 3.0 times higher in\\n      women experiencing >5 years prolapse symptoms compared to </=5 years (95% CI 1.8,\\n      5.0). Sacrospinous hysteropexy with graft had a lower rate of failure than\\n      hysterectomy with USLS (aHR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4, 1.0, p=0.05). Interaction between\\n      symptom duration and apical repair (p=0.07) indicated failure was less likely\\n      after hysteropexy compared to hysterectomy for those with </=5 years symptom\\n      duration, (aHR 0.5 (95% CI 0.2, 0.9) but not for those with >5 years symptoms\\n      (aHR1.0, 95% 0.5, 2.1). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors associated with surgical\\n      failure over 5 years from transvaginal prolapse repair, regardless of approach,\\n      include obesity and duration of prolapse symptoms. Providers and patients should \\n      consider these modifiable risk factors when discussing treatment plans for\\n      bothersome prolapse.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

The pathogenesis of this\\n      microangiopathy is mainly due to impaired vascular endothelial function. The Flow\\n      Mediated Skin Fluorescence (FMSF) method is an innovative, non-invasive tool for \\n      assessing the microcirculation function (especially microcirculatory response to \\n      hypoxia), also in patients with complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). MATERIAL\\n      AND METHODS: The study was conducted at the Medical University of Lodz, Poland.\\n      Total of 84 volunteers including 30 patients with DKD, 33 patients with DM\\n      without complications, and 21 healthy subjects underwent microvascular function\\n      assessments using FMSF. This technique measures changes in the intensity of\\n      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence from the skin on the\\n      forearm as a function of time, in response to blocking and releasing blood flow\\n      in the forearm. In this study we asses two key parameters: Reactive Hyperemia\\n      Response (RHR) and Hypoxia Sensitivity [log(HS)] to characterize vascular\\n      circulation in patients with DKD and their response to transient ischemia.\\n      RESULTS: The patients with low reactive hyperemic response (the RHR parameter)\\n      had a significantly higher sCr than patients with moderate and high RHR value\\n      (p<0.001, p<0.05, respectively) and a significantly lower eGFR than the patients \\n      with moderate and high RHR parameter (p<0.001, p<0.01, respectively). The\\n      patients with very low and low log(HS) values had a significantly higher sCr than\\n      the patients with high log(HS) (p<0.001, p<0.01, respectively), and a\\n      significantly lower eGFR than the patients with high log(HS) parameter (p<0.001, \\n      p<0.01, respectively). The patients with very low log(HS) had a significantly\\n      higher sCr and a significantly lower eGFR than the patients with moderate\\n      (p<0.05, p<0.01, respectively). The mean value of the RHR parameter was\\n      significantly lower in DKD patients (18.31+/-5.06%) compared to both healthy\\n      subjects (34.37+/-8.18%, p<0.001) and DM without complications subgroup\\n      (28.75+/-7.12%, p<0.001). Similar trends were noted with the mean value of\\n      log(HS) parameter in DKD subgroup (1.03+/-0.5) vs. healthy subjects (1.59+/-0.53,\\n      p<0.001), and vs. DM without complications subgroup (1.73+/-0.52, p<0.001). We\\n      observed a significant inverse correlation between the RHR parameter and serum\\n      creatinine (sCr) and a significant positive correlations with eGFR (R=-0.3;\\n      p<0.05, R=0.61; p<0.001, respectively). We found also a significant negative\\n      correlations of the log(HS) measure with sCr and a significant positive\\n      correlations with eGFR (R=-0.33; p<0.01, R=0.55; p<0.001, respectively). We\\n      observed also a significant inverse correlation between the RHR and log(HS)\\n      parameters and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (R=-0.6; p<0.001, R=-0.32; \\n      p<0.01, respectively). The AGEs parameter was also a significantly higher in\\n      patients with low RHR parameter than in patients with moderate (p<0.01) and high \\n      (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The FMSF technique makes it possible to identify\\n      impairments of the microvascular function in patients with DKD. This study\\n      confirms that the simple two-parametric approach diagnostic tool perfectly\\n      characterizes the state of the microvascular system in diabetic patients with\\n      impaired renal function. These preliminary results require further validation in \\n      a larger patients cohort.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

However, there is no effective treatment in order\\n      to offer a favorable outcome encompassing a good recovery after TBI in older\\n      adults. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the histological and\\n      neurobehavioral effects of Allopurinol (ALL) in older rats that received repeated\\n      TBI (rTBI). For this purpose, a weight-drop rTBI model was used on old male\\n      Wistar rats. Rats received 5 repeated TBI/sham injuries 24h apart and were\\n      treated with saline or Allopurinol 100mg/kg, i.p. each time. They were randomly\\n      assigned to three groups: control group (no injury); rTBI group (received 5 rTBI \\n      and treated with saline); rTBI+ALL group (received 5 rTBI and treated with\\n      Allopurinol). Then, half of the animals from each group were sacrificed on day 6 \\n      and the remaining animals were assessed with Open field, Elevated plus maze and\\n      Morris Water Maze test. Basic neurological tasks were evaluated with neurological\\n      assessment protocol every other day until after the 19th day from the last\\n      injury. Brain sections were processed for neuronal cell count in the hippocampus \\n      (CA1), dentate gyrus (DG), and prefrontal cortex (PC). Also, an\\n      immunohistochemical assay was performed to determine NeuN, iNOS, and TNFalpha\\n      levels in the brain regions. The number of neurons was markedly reduced in CA1,\\n      GD, and PC in rats receiving saline compared to those receiving allopurinol\\n      treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis showed marked induction of iNOS and\\n      TNFalpha expression in the brain tissues which were reduced after allopurinol at \\n      6 and 19days post-injury. Also, ALL-treated rats demonstrated a remarkable induce\\n      in NeuN expression, indicating a reduction in rTBI-induced neuronal cell death.\\n      In neurobehavioral analyses, time spent in closed arms, in the corner of the open\\n      field, swimming latency, and distance were impaired in injured rats; however, all\\n      of them were significantly improved by allopurinol therapy. To sum up, this study\\n      demonstrated that ALL may mitigate rTBI-induced damage in aged rats, which\\n      suggests ALL as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of recurrent\\n      TBI.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

However, the specific reprogramming effects of TCDD are unclear. Here, we \\n      performed targeted LC-MS analysis of hepatic extracts from mice gavaged with\\n      TCDD. We detected an increase in S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine, a conjugate from \\n      the spontaneous reaction between the cysteine sulfhydryl group and highly\\n      reactive acrylyl-CoA, an intermediate in the cobalamin (Cbl)-independent\\n      beta-oxidation-like metabolism of propionyl-CoA. TCDD repressed genes in both the\\n      canonical Cbl-dependent carboxylase and the alternate Cbl-independent\\n      beta-oxidation-like pathways as well as inhibited methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) \\n      at lower doses. Moreover, TCDD decreased serum Cbl levels and hepatic cobalt\\n      levels while eliciting negligible effects on gene expression associated with Cbl \\n      absorption, transport, trafficking, or derivatization to\\n      5\\'-deoxy-adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), the required MUT cofactor. Additionally,\\n      TCDD induced the gene encoding aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1), the enzyme\\n      responsible for decarboxylation of cis-aconitate to itaconate, and\\n      dose-dependently increased itaconate levels in hepatic extracts. Our results\\n      indicate MUT inhibition is consistent with itaconate activation to itaconyl-CoA, \\n      a MUT suicide inactivator that forms an adduct with AdoCbl. This adduct in turn\\n      inhibits MUT activity and reduces Cbl levels. Collectively, these results suggest\\n      the decrease in MUT activity is due to Cbl depletion following TCDD treatment,\\n      which redirects propionyl-CoA metabolism to the alternate Cbl-independent\\n      beta-oxidation-like pathway. The resulting hepatic accumulation of acrylyl-CoA\\n      likely contributes to TCDD-elicited hepatotoxicity and the multi-hit progression \\n      of steatosis to steatohepatitis with fibrosis.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

A subset of natural products induces injury processes in\\n      malignant cells that recruit and activate host immune cells to produce an\\n      adaptive anti-cancer immune response, a process known as immunogenic cell death. \\n      However, a challenge in the field is to delineate forms of cell death and injury \\n      that best promote durable antitumor immunity. Addressing this with a single-cell \\n      chemical biology natural product discovery platform, like multiplex activity\\n      metabolomics, would be especially valuable in human leukemia, where cancer cells \\n      are heterogeneous and may react differently to the same compounds. Herein, a new \\n      ten-color, fluorescent cell barcoding-compatible module measuring six immunogenic\\n      cell injury signaling readouts: DNA damage response (gammaH2AX), apoptosis\\n      (cCAS3), necroptosis (p-MLKL), mitosis (p-Histone H3), autophagy (LC3), and the\\n      unfolded protein response (p-EIF2alpha). A proof-of-concept screen was performed \\n      to validate functional changes in single cells induced by secondary metabolites\\n      with known mechanisms within bacterial extracts. This assay was then applied in\\n      multiplexed activity metabolomics to reveal an unexpected mammalian cell injury\\n      profile induced by the natural product narbomycin. Finally, the functional\\n      consequences of injury pathways on immunogenicity were compared with three\\n      canonical assays for immunogenic hallmarks, ATP, HMGB1, and calreticulin, to\\n      correlate secondary metabolite-induced cell injury profiles with canonical\\n      markers of immunogenic cell death. In total, this work demonstrated a new\\n      phenotypic screen for discovery of natural products that modulate injury response\\n      pathways that can contribute to cancer immunogenicity.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

Recruitment of L onto the nucleocapsid depends on the viral\\n      phosphoprotein P, which is an essential L cofactor. A prerequisite for genome and\\n      antigenome encapsidation is the presence of the monomeric, RNA-free,\\n      neosynthesised N protein, named N(0). Stabilisation of N(0) depends on the\\n      binding of the N-terminal residues of P to its surface, which prevents N\\n      oligomerisation. However, the mechanism involved in the transition from N(0)-P to\\n      nucleocapsid assembly, and thus in the specificity of viral genome encapsidation,\\n      is still unknown. Furthermore, the specific role of N oligomerisation and RNA in \\n      the morphogenesis of viral factories, where viral transcription and replication\\n      occur, have not been elucidated although the interaction between P and N\\n      complexed to RNA has been shown to be responsible for this process. Here, using a\\n      chimeric protein comprising N and the first 40 N-terminal residues of P, we\\n      succeeded in purifying a recombinant N(0)-like protein competent for RNA\\n      encapsidation in vitro. Our results showed the importance of RNA length for\\n      stable encapsidation and revealed that the nature of the 5\\' end of RNA does not\\n      explain the specificity of encapsidation. Finally, we showed that RNA\\n      encapsidation is crucial for the in vitro reconstitution of pseudo-viral\\n      factories. Together, our findings provide insight into RSV viral genome\\n      encapsidation specificity.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Genetic factors are important to consider as\\n      elements leading to NOA. Although many pathogenic genes have been reported, the\\n      causative genes of NOA for many patients are still unknown. In this study, we\\n      found ten point mutations in the gene encoding homeodomain-interacting protein\\n      kinase 4 (HIPK4) in patients with NOA, and using in vitro studies we determined a\\n      premature termination point mutation (p.

Our phosphoproteomic analysis of Hipk4(-/-) testes\\n      revealed phosphorylation of multiple proteins regulated by HIPK4 during\\n      spermiogenesis. We also confirmed that a substrate of HIPK4 with four\\n      down-regulated phosphorylation sites matching the xSPx motif is the known\\n      manchette-related protein RIMS-binding protein 3 (RIMBP3), which is required for \\n      sperm head morphogenesis. Therefore, we conclude HIPK4 regulates the\\n      phosphorylation of manchette protein RIMBP3 and plays essential roles in sperm\\n      head shaping and male fertility.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

The change in the ratio of villus\\n      height to crypt depth (Vh:Cd) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints\\n      included densities of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and symptom severity.\\n      These endpoints were evaluated by ANCOVA. Additional endpoints included serology \\n      and gluten-immunogenic peptides (GIP) in urine RESULTS: Fifty (50) patients were \\n      randomized, and 43 patients completed (n=21 IMGX003, n=22 placebo). The mean\\n      DeltaVh:Cd (primary endpoint) for IMGX003 vs. placebo was -0.04 vs. -0.35 (p =\\n      .057). The mean DeltaIEL (secondary endpoint) for IMGX003 vs. placebo was 9.8 vs.\\n      24.8 (p = .018). The mean change (worsening) in symptom severity (secondary\\n      endpoint) for IMGX003 vs. placebo was 0.22 vs. 1.63 (abdominal pain, p = .231),\\n      0.96 vs. 3.29 (bloating, p = .204), and 0.02 vs. 3.20 (tiredness, p = .113). The \\n      3 x 2-week trend-line significance for these symptoms, respectively, were p =\\n      .014, .030 and .002 CONCLUSION: IMGX003 reduced gluten-induced intestinal mucosal\\n      damage and symptom severity.

METHODS: Databases were searched up to June 2022; CENTRAL,\\n      CINAHL, MEDLINE, PEDRo, and PubMed. Following PRISMA reporting guidelines, two\\n      independent reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Study quality and\\n      levels of evidence were assessed. RESULTS: Following selection from 624 initial\\n      search results, six randomised controlled trials were identified, comprising 124 \\n      participants. Quality of Evidence was very low to moderate. Meta-analysis showed \\n      that post intervention, IMT significantly improved maximal inspiratory pressure\\n      (MD 15.72 cmH2O, 95% CI 5.02, 26.41, p = 0.004) when compared with a control\\n      intervention. There was no significant benefit for physical QOL (SMD 0.12, 95% CI\\n      -1.01, 1.25, p = 0.84), mental QOL (SMD -0.2, 95% CI -1.72, 1.33, p = 0.80),\\n      maximal expiratory pressure (MD 5.19 cmH2O, 95% CI -4.16, 14.55, p = 0.80), or\\n      FEV1 (MD 0.26 L, 95% CI -0.19, 0.7, p = 0.26). Sensitivity analyses found larger \\n      effects for studies with 8 week interventions (MD 17.5 cmH2O (95% CI 3.36 to\\n      31.66)) and spring loaded devices alone (MD 21.18 cmH2O, 95% CI 9.65 to 32.72).\\n      CONCLUSION: Moderate quality evidence suggests IMT improves respiratory strength \\n      in adults with an SCI. The mental and physical QOL outcomes provided very low\\n      quality of evidence, with considerable heterogeneity between study results,\\n      leading to inconsistency. Further research is warranted to investigate medium and\\n      long-term impact of robust IMT protocols, accounting for patient motivation and\\n      adherence to IMT.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONInspiratory muscle training (IMT)\\n      significantly improves respiratory muscle strength in adults with spinal cord\\n      injuries-irrespective of time since injury, or degree of injury completeness.IMT \\n      is a feasible, safe, and worthwhile intervention to implement with adults with\\n      spinal cord injuries and can be utilized in a variety of settings.IMT\\n      interventions that are 8 weeks long and utilize a spring-loaded inspiratory\\n      threshold device may generate the largest improvements in respiratory strength.\\nFAU - Woods, Alyson\\nAU  - Woods A\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5999-6648\\nAD  - Department of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK.\\nFAU - Gustafson, Owen\\nAU  - Gustafson O\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-5450-3696\\nAD  - Oxford Allied Health Professions Research and Innovation Unit, Oxford University \\n      Hospitals NHSFT, Oxford, UK.\\nAD  - Centre for Movement, Occupational and Rehabilitation Sciences, Oxford Brookes\\n      University, Oxford, UK.\\nFAU - Williams, Mark\\nAU  - Williams M\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3488-847X\\nAD  - Department of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK.\\nAD  - Centre for Movement, Occupational and Rehabilitation Sciences, Oxford Brookes\\n      University, Oxford, UK.\\nFAU - Stiger, Robyn\\nAU  - Stiger R\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-6704-0558\\nAD  - Department of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK.\\nAD  - Centre for Movement, Occupational and Rehabilitation Sciences, Oxford Brookes\\n      University, Oxford, UK.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Disabil Rehabil\\nJT  - Disability and rehabilitation\\nJID - 9207179\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Systematic review\\nOT  - physical therapy (specialty)\\nOT  - quality of life\\nOT  - respiratory strength\\nOT  - spinal cord injury\\nOT  - tetraplegia\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 19:12\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 19:12 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/09638288.2022.2107085 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Disabil Rehabil. 2022 Aug 5:1-12. doi: 10.1080/09638288.2022.2107085.\\n\\nPMID- 35931097\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1945-7197 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0021-972X (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Screening accuracy of the 50g-glucose challenge test in twin compared with\\n      singleton pregnancies.\\nLID - dgac472 [pii]\\nLID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac472 [doi]\\nAB  - CONTEXT: The optimal 50g-glucose challenge test (GCT) cut-off for the diagnosis\\n      of gestational diabetes (GDM) in twin pregnancies is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To\\n      explore the screening accuracy of the 50g-GCT and its correlation with the risk\\n      of large for gestational age (LGA) newborn in twin compared to singleton\\n      pregnancies. DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study (2007-2017).\\n      SETTING: Ontario, Canada. POPULATION: Patients with a singleton\\n      (n=546,892[98.4%]) or twin (n=8,832[1.6%]) birth who underwent screening for GDM \\n      using the 50g-GCT. METHODS: We compared the screening accuracy, risk of GDM, and \\n      risk of LGA between twin and singleton pregnancies using various 50g-GCT\\n      cut-offs. RESULTS: For any given 50g-GCT result, the probability of GDM was\\n      higher (p=0.0067) while the probability of LGA was considerably lower in the twin\\n      compared with the singleton group, even when a twin-specific growth chart was\\n      used to diagnose LGA in the twin group (p<0.001). The estimated false positive\\n      rate (FPR) for GDM was higher in twin compared with singleton pregnancies\\n      irrespective of the 50g-GCT cut-off used. The cut-off of 8.2 mmol/L (148 mg/dL)\\n      in twin pregnancies was associated with an estimated FPR (10.7-11.1%) that was\\n      similar to the FPR associated with the cut-off of 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) in\\n      singleton pregnancies (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The screening performance of the\\n      50g-GCT for GDM and its correlation with LGA differ between twin and singleton\\n      pregnancies.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.

High-moisture corn was harvested when kernel DM concentrations\\n      were approaching 65% as-fed, and either left undried (HMC65; 67.6% DM) or dried\\n      at 40 degrees C to approximately 70% DM (HMC70; 71.0% DM), and then ensiled in\\n      quadruplicate vacuum pouches untreated (CON) or after one of the following\\n      inoculant treatments: 6.36 x 10 5 cfu of Lentilactobacillus buchneri DSM 12856,\\n      Lactiplantibacillus plantarum DSM 12836, and Pediococcus acidilactici DSM 16243\\n      per g of HMC (LBLP); or 3.0 x 10 5 cfu of L. buchneri DSM 12856,\\n      Lentilactobacillus diolivorans DSM 32074, and P. acidilactici DSM 16243 per g of \\n      HMC (LBLD). Vacuum pouches were allowed to ferment for 7, 14, 28, or 56 d. A\\n      three-way interaction was observed (P = 0.01) for the pH of HMC, where CON for\\n      HMC70 was greatest across storage lengths and HMC65 treatments generally had a\\n      lower pH than other treatments. Concentrations of total acids were greater (P =\\n      0.001) in HMC65 than HMC70 and greater (P = 0.001) in HMC treated with LBLP and\\n      LBLD than CON. An interaction between DM concentration, microbial inoculation,\\n      and storage length was observed (P = 0.05) for concentrations of acetic acid. At \\n      14 d, acetic acid concentrations were greater in HMC65 treated with LBLD than\\n      other treatments. Likewise, at 56 d, concentrations of acetic acid were greatest \\n      in HMC65 treated with LBLD, followed by HMC70 treated with LBLD. An interaction\\n      between DM concentration, microbial inoculation, and storage length was observed \\n      (P = 0.05) for 7-h starch disappearance (starchD). Across all DM concentration\\n      and inoculant treatment combinations, starchD increased with increasing storage\\n      length. StarchD was also generally greater for HMC65 treatments compared to\\n      HMC70, with small differences among inoculants.

The goal of this study was to characterize factors associated with\\n      successful engagement with Quitline following e-referrals by physicians in\\n      Maryland. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study with hierarchical data\\n      modeling. Data for 1790 patients e-referred in 2018-2019 by the University of\\n      Maryland Medical System were analyzed. Patients\\' engagement was assessed using a \\n      Generalized Estimating Equation multivariable regression model for ordinal\\n      outcomes at two levels: picking up a phone call from Quitline (1-800-QUIT-NOW)\\n      and enrollment in tobacco cessation programs. RESULTS: Older age, female gender, \\n      Black race, low socioeconomic status, and provider\\'s skills were significantly\\n      associated with successful outcomes of Quitline referral. The engagement with\\n      Quitline was higher in Black non-Hispanic patients compared to other\\n      racial/ethnic groups (phone call response OR=1.99, 95% CI 1.35, 2.93 and service \\n      acceptance OR=1.89, 95% CI 1.28, 2.79). Patients residing in socioeconomically\\n      deprived areas were more likely to respond to Quitline phone call compared to\\n      those from affluent neighborhoods (OR=1.52, 95% CI 1.03, 2.25). Patients referred\\n      by faculty/attending physicians were more likely to respond compared to those\\n      referred by residents (OR=1.23, 95% CI 1.04, 1.44, p=0.0141). CONCLUSIONS:\\n      Multiple factors impact successful engagement with Quitline. Additional means to \\n      improve Quitline engagement success may include focused messaging on tobacco\\n      cessation benefits to patients, and skillful counselling by the provider.\\n      IMPLICATIONS: Implementation of the Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tool for\\n      electronic referrals to the Tobacco Quitline at the University of Maryland\\n      Medical System was successful in providing evidence-based free service to elderly\\n      patients and socioeconomically disadvantaged racial/ethnic minorities. The CDS\\n      also served to engage physicians in conversation about tobacco use and cessation \\n      with every tobacco using patient. Curricular content for physicians in training\\n      should be enriched to expand tobacco use and treatment.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.

We aimed to develop an AI model, to\\n      compare its diagnostic performance with doctors of different experience levels,\\n      and to further evaluate its auxiliary role for doctors in diagnosing multiple\\n      abnormalities in SBCE videos. METHODS : The AI model was trained using 280 426\\n      images from 2565 patients, and the diagnostic performance was validated in 240\\n      videos. RESULTS : The sensitivity of the AI model for red spots, inflammation,\\n      blood content, vascular lesions, protruding lesions, parasites, diverticulum, and\\n      normal variants was 97.8 %, 96.1 %, 96.1 %, 94.7 %, 95.6 %, 100 %, 100 %, and\\n      96.4 %, respectively. The specificity was 86.0 %, 75.3 %, 87.3 %, 77.8 %, 67.7 %,\\n      97.5 %, 91.2 %, and 81.3 %, respectively. The accuracy was 95.0 %, 88.8 %, 89.2\\n      %, 79.2 %, 80.8 %, 97.5 %, 91.3 %, and 93.3 %, respectively. For junior doctors, \\n      the assistance of the AI model increased the overall accuracy from 85.5 % to 97.9\\n      % (P < 0.001, Bonferroni corrected), comparable to that of experts (96.6 %, P >\\n      0.0125, Bonferroni corrected). CONCLUSIONS : This well-trained AI diagnostic\\n      model automatically diagnosed multiple small-bowel abnormalities simultaneously\\n      based on video-level recognition, with potential as an excellent auxiliary system\\n      for less-experienced endoscopists.\\nCI  - Thieme.

METHODS: We prospectively studied 120 patients referred for [18F]FDG\\n      PET/CT imaging. Patients were allocated in 4 groups of 30 patients depending on\\n      the use of the audiovisual intervention: (1) no audiovisual intervention; (2)\\n      audiovisual intervention only in the uptake room; (3) audiovisual intervention\\n      only in the scanning room; (4) audiovisual intervention in the uptake and the\\n      scanning rooms. In order to measure the anxiety levels of the patients before and\\n      after the scan, all patients answered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).\\n      RESULTS: The anxiety status across typical situations on a daily basis (STAI-T)\\n      of the 4 groups of patients was comparable with no significant differences. The\\n      mean State Anxiety (STAI-S) sum-score at prescan and postscan among groups was:\\n      (1) 17.5+/-8.7 vs. 17.3+/-8.6, p=0.834; (2) 17.4+/-10.5 vs. 15.8+/-9.6, p=0.110; \\n      (3) 17.5+/-11.7 vs. 15.1+/-9.8, p= 0.013; (4) 17.4+/-9.7 vs. 14.9+/-8.1, p=\\n      0.009. The percentage of patients with reduction of the STAI-S score among groups\\n      1-4 was 17%, 47%, 50%, and 66%, respectively. The variation of the percentage of \\n      patients with lower scores after intervention among groups was statistically\\n      significant (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Audiovisual intervention decreases anxiety\\n      levels of patients referred for PET/CT imaging.

BCs arising in PHTS are clinically\\n      distinct from sporadic BCs, including younger age of onset, multifocality, and an\\n      increased risk of second primary BCs. Yet, there is no previous investigation\\n      into the underlying genomic landscape of this entity. We sought to address the\\n      hypothesis that BCs arising in PHTS have a distinct genomic landscape compared to\\n      sporadic counterparts. We performed and analyzed exome sequencing data from 44\\n      women with germline PTEN variants who developed BCs. The control cohort comprised\\n      of 497 women with sporadic BCs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We\\n      demonstrate that PHTS-derived BCs have a distinct somatic mutational landscape\\n      compared to the sporadic counterparts, namely second somatic hits in PTEN,\\n      distinct mutational signatures, and increased genomic instability. The PHTS group\\n      had a significantly higher frequency of somatic PTEN variants compared to TCGA\\n      (22.7% versus 5.6%; odds ratio [OR] 4.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.21 to\\n      10.98; p < 0.001) and a lower mutational frequency in PIK3CA (22.7% versus 33.4%;\\n      OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.22; p = 0.15). Somatic variants in PTEN and PIK3CA were\\n      mutually exclusive in PHTS (p = 0.01) but not in TCGA. Our findings have\\n      important implications for the personalized management of PTEN-related BCs,\\n      especially in the context of more accessible genetic testing.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

However,\\n      non-causal genes can exhibit association signals due to confounding by linkage\\n      disequilibrium (LD) patterns and eQTL pleiotropy at genomic risk regions, which\\n      necessitates fine-mapping of TWAS signals. Here, we present MA-FOCUS, a\\n      multi-ancestry framework for the improved identification of genes underlying\\n      traits of interest. We demonstrate that by leveraging differences in\\n      ancestry-specific patterns of LD and eQTL signals, MA-FOCUS consistently\\n      outperforms single-ancestry fine-mapping approaches with equivalent total sample \\n      sizes across multiple metrics. We perform TWASs for 15 blood traits using\\n      genome-wide summary statistics (average nEA = 511 k, nAA = 13 k) and\\n      lymphoblastoid cell line eQTL data from cohorts of primarily European and African\\n      continental ancestries. We recapitulate evidence demonstrating shared genetic\\n      architectures for eQTL and blood traits between the two ancestry groups and\\n      observe that gene-level effects correlate 20% more strongly across ancestries\\n      than SNP-level effects. Lastly, we perform fine-mapping using MA-FOCUS and find\\n      evidence that genes at TWAS risk regions are more likely to be shared across\\n      ancestries than they are to be ancestry specific. Using multiple lines of\\n      evidence to validate our findings, we find that gene sets produced by MA-FOCUS\\n      are more enriched in hematopoietic categories than alternative approaches (p =\\n      2.36 x 10(-15)).

This study measured changes in objective and subjective\\n      cognitive function following repeated ketamine treatment. METHODS: Thirty-eight\\n      patients with treatment-resistant depression were administered cognitive\\n      assessments before and after undergoing 7 intravenous ketamine infusions (0.5\\n      mg/kg over 40 minutes) within a clinical trial examining the efficacy of single\\n      and repeated administrations. Depression severity and perceived concentration\\n      were evaluated with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the\\n      Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms Self-Report (QIDS-SR16). RESULTS:\\n      Twenty-three participants (60.5%) responded after repeated infusions (>/= 50%\\n      decrease in MADRS total scores). We measured significant improvements in several \\n      cognitive domains including attention, working memory, verbal and visuospatial\\n      memory (effect sizes ranging from Cohen\\'s d = 0.37-0.79). Cognitive changes were \\n      attributed to reduction in depressive symptoms except for improvement in verbal\\n      memory which remained significant after adjustment for change in MADRS total\\n      score (P = .029, etap2 = 0.13). Only responders reported improvement in\\n      subjective cognitive function with repeated ketamine administration (MADRS item\\n      6, P < .001, d = 2.00; QIDS item 10, P < .001, d = 1.36). CONCLUSION: A short\\n      course of repeated ketamine infusions did not impair neurocognitive function in\\n      patients with treatment-resistant depression. Further research is required to\\n      understand the potential mediating role of response and remission on improved\\n      cognitive function accompanying ketamine treatment as well as to examine\\n      longer-term safety outcomes.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.

In toddlers, this information \\n      is still lacking. We therefore aimed to investigate the feasibility and\\n      reliability of SARA-scores in typically developing toddlers. METHODS: In 57\\n      typically developing toddlers (2-4 years), we aimed to determine the: 1.\\n      feasibility of SARA-scores, 2. age-related pre-requisites to obtain SARA-scores\\n      in toddlers over all domains, 3. SARA-score reliability, 4. mathematical age\\n      connection of SARA-scores in toddlers and older children. RESULTS: In typically\\n      developing toddlers, the feasibility of SARA is strongly age-dependent (p <\\n      .000). After computing compensations for two age-related, unfeasible and\\n      therefore un-assessable kinetic subtasks and after allowing the videotaping of\\n      non-kinetic SARA sub-task performances at home, the SARA was fully reliably\\n      assessable in all (n = 57) toddlers (ICC = 0.732). From two to 16 years of age,\\n      SARA-scores were mathematically represented by one continuous, exponentially\\n      decreasing trend line approaching the adult-optimum at 16 years of age.\\n      CONCLUSION: In toddlers, SARA-scores are reliably assessable, by using two\\n      age-compensations and allowing the videotaping of SARA-performances partly at\\n      home. In children with EOA, these data enable longitudinal quantification and\\n      interpretation of quantitative ataxia-scores by SARA from 2 years of age\\n      throughout childhood.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of European Paediatric Neurology\\n      Society.\\nFAU - Schouwstra, K J\\nAU  - Schouwstra KJ\\nAD  - Department of Paediatric Neurology University of Groningen, University Medical\\n      Centre Groningen, Department of Neurology, Groningen, the Netherlands.\\nFAU - Polet, S S\\nAU  - Polet SS\\nAD  - Department of Paediatric Neurology University of Groningen, University Medical\\n      Centre Groningen, Department of Neurology, Groningen, the Netherlands.\\nFAU - Hbrahimgel, S\\nAU  - Hbrahimgel S\\nAD  - Department of Paediatric Neurology University of Groningen, University Medical\\n      Centre Groningen, Department of Neurology, Groningen, the Netherlands.\\nFAU - Tadema, A S\\nAU  - Tadema AS\\nAD  - Department of Paediatric Neurology University of Groningen, University Medical\\n      Centre Groningen, Department of Neurology, Groningen, the Netherlands.\\nFAU - Burgerhof, J G M\\nAU  - Burgerhof JGM\\nAD  - Department of Epidemiology, University Medical Centre Groningen, the Netherlands.\\nFAU - Brandsma, R\\nAU  - Brandsma R\\nAD  - Department of Paediatric Neurology University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht,\\n      the Netherlands.\\nFAU - Sival, D A\\nAU  - Sival DA\\nAD  - Department of Paediatric Neurology University of Groningen, University Medical\\n      Centre Groningen, Department of Neurology, Groningen, the Netherlands.

The overall risk predictors of TRAS\\n      are poorly understood. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with suspected\\n      TRAS (Doppler ultrasound PSV > 200 cm/s) who underwent angiographic study in a\\n      single center between 2007 and 2014. All patients with stenosis > 50% were\\n      considered with TRAS. Stenosis restricted in the body of the artery was also\\n      analyzed in a subgroup. RESULTS: 274 patients were submitted to a renal\\n      angiography and 166 confirmed TRAS. TRAS group featured an older population (46.3\\n      +/- 11.0 vs. 40.9 +/-14.2 years; p = 0.001), more frequent hypertensive\\n      nephropathy (30.1% vs. 15.7%; p = 0.01), higher incidence of Delayed Graft\\n      Function (DGF) (52.0% vs. 25.6%; p < 0.001) and longer Cold Ischemia Time (CIT)\\n      (21.5 +/- 10.6 vs. 15.7 +/- 12.9h; p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses, DGF (OR\\n      = 3.31; 95% CI 1.786.30; p < 0.0001) was independent risk factors for TRAS. DM\\n      and CIT showed a tendency towards TRAS. The compound discriminatory capacity of\\n      the multivariable model (AUC = 0.775; 95% CI 0.7180.831) is significantly higher \\n      than systolic blood pressure and creatinine alone (AUC = 0.62; 95% CI\\n      0.558-0.661). In body artery stenosis subgroup, DGF (OR = 1.86; 95% CI 1.043.36; \\n      p = 0.03) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) (OR = 2.44; 95% CI 1.314.60; p = 0.005) were\\n      independent risk factors for TRAS. CONCLUSION: In our transplant population, DGF \\n      increased more than 3-fold the risk of TRAS. In the subgroup analysis, both DGF\\n      and DM increases the risk of body artery stenosis. The addition of other factors \\n      to hypertension and renal dysfunction may increase diagnostic accuracy.

The purpose of this study is to describe,\\n      quantify, and trend ED encounters associated with pumpkin-related knife injuries.\\n      METHODS: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) was queried\\n      for pumpkin-related knife injuries from 2012 to 2021. Patient demographic and\\n      injury data was collected and analyzed to describe trends in incidence, patient\\n      demographics, and injury patterns associated with an ED encounter for a\\n      pumpkin-related knife injury. RESULTS: There were an estimated 20,579 (95% CI:\\n      17,738-23,420) pumpkin-related knife injuries from 2012 to 2021. The incidence of\\n      pumpkin-related knife injuries remained stable over time (R(2) = 0.195, P =\\n      0.201). Hand injuries comprised 87.6% of all injuries, with the thumb (33.5%) and\\n      index finger (25.0%) most commonly affected. Men and women were injured at\\n      similar rates (51.6% vs 48.4%). The most common demographic injured were 10 to\\n      19-year olds (31.5%) followed by children <10-years old (19.5%). Women ages 10 to\\n      19-years old were the most commonly injured subgroup (10.0% of all injuries).\\n      Most ED presentations occurred on Saturdays (16.5%) or Sundays (23.3%). The large\\n      majority occurred during the months of October (83.5%) followed by November\\n      (11.2%), with almost half of all cases (45.6%) occurring in the last week of\\n      October. Peak incidence of injury occurred on October 30th. CONCLUSION:\\n      Pumpkin-related knife injuries are a preventable cause of hand injury with\\n      predictably high-incidence in fall months. Additionally, our data suggests\\n      further precautions should be taken to prevent injury in pediatric patients.\\n      Understanding at-risk populations in addition to implementing public safety\\n      initiatives and education on safe pumpkin-carving techniques could prevent\\n      serious injuries in the future.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: The fetal rat model of MMC was induced by \\n      intragastric administration of atRA to pregnant rats on embryonic day 10 (E10).\\n      Fetal rats were harvested at E16, E18, E20, and E21 for observation and further\\n      testing. Those with MMC were classified as the MMC group, while those without MMC\\n      as the RA group. The areas of MMC skin defect, the crown-rump length (CRL), and\\n      body weight in different groups were compared. The histopathological changes in\\n      the bladder were compared. The expression levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin\\n      (alphaSMA), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC), connexin 43 (Cx43), desmin,\\n      beta3 tubulin, and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in the bladder\\n      were investigated by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Pregnant \\n      rats given intragastric administration with olive oil (OIL group) at E10 were set\\n      as the blank control group. RESULTS: A total of 415 fetal rats of different\\n      gestational ages were harvested with an MMC incidence of 56.05 % (139/248). The\\n      incidence rate increased with embryonic days (p < 0.001). Compared with the other\\n      two control groups, the CRL and bodyweight of MMC fetal rats were significantly\\n      delayed at E21 (p < 0.001). The expression levels of alphaSMA, SMMHC, Cx43,\\n      desmin, beta3 tubulin and VAChT in the bladder of MMC fetal rats were\\n      significantly decreased at E21 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In atRA-induced MMC fetal\\n      rats, there is neural, muscular, and stromal dysplasia in the bladder at an early\\n      gestational age. Further investigations on neurogenic bladder secondary to MMC\\n      are applicable using this animal model.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Down-regulation of Nrf2 and induction of pro-inflammatory mediators are the\\n      main pathological factors. Recently, ameliorative potential of the angiotensin II\\n      (AII) type-1 (AT1) receptor blocker olmesartan (OLM) on oxidative stress and\\n      inflammatory cytokines was reported. The current study aims to investigate the\\n      possible protective effect of OLM on CP-induced HC in Wistar rats. The animals\\n      were divided into the control group (0.5% W/V carboxymethylcellulose, p.o.); OLM \\n      group (20 mg/kg, p.o., for 21 days); CP group (a single dose of 100 mg/kg, i.p.);\\n      and the remaining groups that received CP i.p. with oral OLM 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg\\n      for 21 days, respectively. The bladder tissue was collected for histopathology,\\n      immunohistochemistry, ELISA, Western blot, and oxidative stress assay. The OLM at\\n      doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg attenuated increase in TNF-alpha, IL-6, NF-kB, iNOS, and\\n      COX-2 induced by CP. Additionally, it up-regulated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, bladder\\n      GSH content, and CAT and SOD activities. The data indicated that OLM inhibited\\n      ROS-induced NF-kB, which caused inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and\\n      activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Hence, OLM holds great promise for\\n      preventing CP-induced HC.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Cancer mortality data were obtained\\n      from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) and standardized by age using\\n      the World Health Organization (WHO) standard population ratios. The change in\\n      cancer-related mortality over the years was evaluated using Joinpoint Regression \\n      Analysis (JRA). RESULTS: Total cancer-related deaths increased by 2.2% annually\\n      between 2009 and 2014 and decreased by 2.9% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p <\\n      0.05). Among men; lung cancer-related deaths increased by 2.4% annually between\\n      2009 and 2014 and decreased by 3.4% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p < 0.05),\\n      stomach cancer-related deaths decreased by 5.1% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p\\n      < 0.05), colon cancer-related deaths increased by 5.8% annually between 2009 and \\n      2015 and decreased by 3.3% annually between 2015 and 2019 (p < 0.05), pancreatic \\n      cancer-related deaths increased annually by 5.6% in 2009-2013 (p < 0.05). Among\\n      women; lung cancer-related deaths increased by 2.5% annually between 2009 and\\n      2016 (p < 0.05), stomach cancer-related deaths increased annually by 2.3% between\\n      2009 and 2014 and decreased annually by 4.5% between 2014 and 2019 (p < 0.05),\\n      colon cancer-related deaths increased by 2.5% annually between 2009 and 2017 (p <\\n      0.05), pancreatic cancer-related deaths increased by 7.4% annually between 2009\\n      and 2013 (p < 0.05) and breast cancer-related deaths increased by 2.2% annually\\n      between 2009 and 2019 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mortality data in Turkey are\\n      collected only by TURKSTAT, which raises concern regarding the incompletion of\\n      the data. While this might lead to underestimation, the trend shows that there\\n      has been a decrease in total cancer-related deaths in Turkey. Pancreatic cancer, \\n      on the other hand, gains a higher proportion in cancer-related deaths in Turkey\\n      as in the world. Increasing deaths from lung and breast cancer in women remind of\\n      the importance of tobacco control interventions and cancer screening programs.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of the present study was to assess the association between\\n      dietary intake of PBDEs and breast cancer risk in the French E3N cohort study,\\n      and to investigate the potential modification of this association by vegetable\\n      oil consumption. The study included 67879 women. Intakes of eight PBDEs were\\n      estimated using food consumption data from a validated semi-quantitative food\\n      frequency questionnaire, and food contamination levels measured by the French\\n      Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES). Cox\\n      proportional hazards models were used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95%\\n      Confidence Intervals (CI) for the association between total PBDEs dietary intake \\n      and breast cancer risk. Interaction measures for vegetable oil consumption were\\n      estimated on both additive and multiplicative scales. The women were followed for\\n      a maximum of 21.4 years, and 5 686 developed an incident breast cancer. A\\n      positive linear trend was highlighted between dietary intake of PBDEs in quintile\\n      groups and breast cancer risk, borderline with statistical significance (p-trend \\n      = 0.06, HRQ5vsQ1 and 95% CI: 1.09 [0.99;1.20]). Interaction measures for\\n      vegetable oil consumption were significant in both additive and multiplicative\\n      scales. Higher effect sizes of the association were highlighted in high consumers\\n      of vegetable oil, i.e. >/=4.6 g/day (HRQ5vsQ1 and 95% CI: 1.23 [1.08; 1.40]), and\\n      almost no effect were found in low consumers (HRQ5vsQ1 and 95% CI: 0.97 [0.86;\\n      1.10]). Highlighting such interactions between nutrients and chemicals is crucial\\n      to develop efficient dietary recommendations to limit the negative health effects\\n      associated with exposure to food chemical contaminants.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

AIM: We aimed to determine the associations between food insecurity\\n      and ED in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. METHODS: Data was\\n      extracted from 3,891 participants (aged >/= 20 years) with ED in the 2001-2004\\n      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Multivariable logistic\\n      regression analysis with sampling weights was conducted to evaluate the\\n      associations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Food security was assessed utilizing the\\n      Household Food Security Module. A single-question self-report from the\\n      Massachusetts Male Aging Study was utilized to evaluate ED status. RESULTS:\\n      Approximately 10.2% of individuals had food insecurity. Food insecurity was\\n      significantly associated with ED after full adjustment (odds ratio [OR] 1.56; 95%\\n      confidence interval [95% CI] 1.16-2.09; P = .003). Men with very low food\\n      insecurity had 59% higher risks of ED compared with those having high food\\n      security (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.13-2.27; P = .006). Moreover, the associations were\\n      stronger in the old people (age >/= 60) (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.26-3.66; P = .004).\\n      CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity might be associated with higher risks of developing \\n      ED.

METHODS: Patient-level data\\n      were obtained from a de-identified real-world database. Patients diagnosed with\\n      advanced/metastatic NSCLC with no prior exposure to a RET inhibitor and one or\\n      more prior line of therapy were eligible. Additionally, individual patient-level \\n      data (IPD) were obtained from the pemetrexed + platinum arm of KEYNOTE-189\\n      (NCT03950674, first line) and the docetaxel arm of REVEL (NCT01168973,\\n      post-progression). Patients were matched using entropy balancing, doubly robust\\n      method, and propensity score approaches. For patients with unknown/negative RET\\n      status, adjustment was made using a model fitted to IPD from a real-world\\n      database. RESULTS: In first-line unadjusted analyses of the real-world control,\\n      ORR was 87.2% for LIBRETTO-001 versus 66.7% for those with RET-positive NSCLC (P \\n      = 0.06). After adjustment for unknown RET status and other patient\\n      characteristics, selpercatinib remained significantly superior versus the\\n      real-world control for all outcomes (all P < 0.001 except unadjusted\\n      RET-fusion-positive cohort). Similarly, outcomes were significantly improved\\n      versus clinical trial controls (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest\\n      improvement in outcomes associated with selpercatinib treatment versus the\\n      multiple external control cohorts, but should be interpreted with caution. Data\\n      were limited by the rarity of RET, lack of mature OS data, and uncertainty from\\n      assumptions to create control arms from external data.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

STUDY DESIGN: A multi-disciplinary task force\\n      created a hypertensive pathway order set and provided staff training. The order\\n      set allowed providers to initiate a treatment algorithm, which then gave nurses\\n      guidelines to recheck blood pressures and progressively increase short-acting\\n      antihypertensive dosage if needed. Pregnant and postpartum patients documented to\\n      have >/=2 consecutive severe range blood pressures in the year prior (2017) and\\n      the year after (2019) implementation of the pathway were included. Primary\\n      outcomes included whether any antihypertensive was given, whether it was given\\n      for all instances of severe hypertension, and time to antihypertensive\\n      administration. RESULTS: A total of 566 patients with severe hypertension were\\n      included-304 in the pre-implementation year and 262 in the post-implementation\\n      year. Significantly more patients received an antihypertensive at least once (67 \\n      % versus 80 %, p < 0.01) and for all instances of severe hypertension (29 %\\n      versus 47 %, p < 0.01) in the post-intervention cohort. There was a significant\\n      improvement in time to antihypertensive administration (24 versus 10 min, p <\\n      0.01). CONCLUSION: This study evaluates the efficacy of an antihypertensive\\n      intervention in the Southeast United States, which is particularly significant\\n      given the region\\'s higher rates of hypertension and hypertension-related\\n      mortality. This study provides confirmatory evidence that implementation of a\\n      standardized order set along with measuring compliance and staff education is\\n      associated with improved treatment rates and time to treatment administration.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in\\n      Pregnancy.

METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted on 120 patients with\\n      limb fractures in need of casting. The study was conducted from November 1, 2020,\\n      to June 1, 2021. A checklist was used to assess complications, and complications \\n      were monitored by regular telephone contact. Each patient was followed up for 3\\n      months. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data.\\n      RESULTS: Pain, impaired mobility, numbness, swelling, and a burning sensation\\n      inside the cast were the most common complications in the first week after cast\\n      application and occurred in 94.2%, 72.5%, 60.8%, 60%, and 54.2% of patients,\\n      respectively. Patients whose casts were applied by a nurse experienced more pain \\n      (p = 0.002), numbness (p = 0.02), and swelling (p = 0.05). The incidence of\\n      numbness was significantly higher in patients who were more active during\\n      convalescence (p = 0.04).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Surveillance,\\n      Epidemiology, and End Results registry, we identified the oldest-old patients\\n      with glioblastomas between 2005 and 2016. Propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier\\n      analysis, Cox regression analysis, and competing risk model were used to assess\\n      the curative efficacy of the surgical treatments. Stratification and interaction \\n      analysis were performed to explore the potential interaction effects. The\\n      conditional survival rates were calculated to explore the longitudinal change in \\n      the survival probability over time. RESULTS: This study enrolled 3309 patients\\n      with a median overall survival of 3 months. The overall survival differed\\n      significantly among the different surgical groups. Considering the gross total\\n      resection as reference, subtotal resection presented adjusted subdistribution\\n      hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.197 (1.052-1.362; p < 0.001);\\n      biopsy/partial resection, 1.242 (1.083-1.424; p = 0.002); and no surgery, 1.309\\n      (1.145-1.497; p < 0.006). Age >/= 83 years, widowed/other status, tumor size 4-5 \\n      cm, and temporal tumors showed significant interaction effects. The adjusted\\n      subdistribution hazard ratio of radical resection was 0.729 (0.645-0.825; p <\\n      0.001). Based on disease-specific survival, the 1-year survival rate was 18% and \\n      26% for the non-radical and radical surgery groups, respectively. The 1-year\\n      conditional survival rates in the second year were 54% and 39% in the non-radical\\n      and radical surgery groups, respectively. The 3-year survival rates were 10% in\\n      both the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Radical surgery may have short-term benefits in the\\n      oldest-old patients with glioblastoma, with a significant increase in the 1-year \\n      survival rate. However, its contribution in the long-term outcome is limited due \\n      to decreased conditional survival rates from the second year after surgery.\\n      Prudent patient selection and improved postoperative management may be needed to \\n      promote the therapeutic efficacy of tumor resection synergistically.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional\\n      study was conducted to analyze the correlation between iron status and thyroid\\n      hormone levels in pregnant women. A total of 2218 pregnant women were recruited, \\n      and iron status and thyroid hormones were measured. Canonical correlation, Lasso \\n      regression, and Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used\\n      to determine the association and related factors. RESULTS: There were 219 cases\\n      with iron deficiency anemia (IDA), 168 cases with iron deficiency (ID), and 1831 \\n      subjects with normal iron status. Compared with normal group, free\\n      triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) in ID group and IDA group had a\\n      significant decreasing trend (P < 0.05), with the lowest levels in IDA group.\\n      Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was significantly increased in ID group and IDA\\n      group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the proportion of hypothyroidism in both ID group and\\n      IDA group was higher than the normal group, meanwhile the proportion of\\n      hyperthyroidism was lower in both groups (P < 0.05). Serum ferritin (SF) and\\n      hemoglobin (Hb) were positively correlated with FT3 and FT4 but negatively\\n      correlated with TSH. Correlation analysis indicated that iron status was\\n      associated with thyroid hormone levels (P < 0.05). Lasso regression analysis\\n      showed that SF, Hb and other variables could be included in the prediction model \\n      of FT4. The variables selected by Lasso model were used for ROC curve analysis,\\n      and the prediction accuracy was acceptable (AUC=0.778, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our\\n      study indicated that there is an association between iron status and thyroid\\n      hormone levels in pregnant women, and the level of FT4 may change with iron\\n      status. Our findings provide new ideas for regulating the thyroid hormone levels \\n      to prevent thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier GmbH.

Adult\\n      cyathostomins reside in the large intestine of the horse and larval stages encyst\\n      within intestinal mucosa. Manual worm collection from aliquots of intestinal\\n      content is the current gold standard for retrieval and enumeration of luminal\\n      parasites, however, no research has been conducted to standardize specific\\n      parameters for processing and storage of samples. The aims of this study were (1)\\n      to evaluate the precision of current standard operating procedures for\\n      enumeration of luminal adult cyathostomin populations, (2) investigate the\\n      influence of chosen fixative, either 70 % ethanol or 10 % buffered formalin, as\\n      well as storage duration, immediately post necropsy vs. stored for eight weeks,\\n      on the magnitude and precision of worm counts, and (3) compare the luminal count \\n      magnitude between the three intestinal segments (cecum, ventral colon, dorsal\\n      colon). Ten miniature horses were enrolled in this study for euthanasia and\\n      necropsy over a four-week period. Luminal worm counts were conducted for 2 %\\n      aliquots of the cecum, ventral colon, and dorsal colon and samples were allocated\\n      to the two fixatives and the two storage durations. Precision was evaluated by\\n      coefficient of variation (CV) and was 13.04 % for total cyathostomin counts. Mean\\n      CV for large intestinal segments ranged from 15.31 % to 52.50 % irrespective of\\n      fixative used or storage duration. cecum worm counts were significantly lower\\n      compared to the ventral colon (p = 0.008) and dorsal colon (p = 0.01). Fixative\\n      and storage duration were not statistically associated with count precision or\\n      magnitude. This study demonstrated moderate to high precision estimates for\\n      luminal cyathostomin worm counts but did not identify any effects of fixative and\\n      storage duration within the framework of the study. This is the first study to\\n      determine cyathostomin worm count precision, and results will be useful for power\\n      analyses in the future.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Consecutive\\n      ALS patients underwent one polysomnography during APCV and one during ACV. HRV\\n      was analyzed both in the total sleep period (from first stage N1 to last\\n      awakening) and in a 5-minute period of stable stage N2. Time domain, frequency\\n      domain and nonlinear indexes of HRV were measured. RESULTS: Nineteen patients\\n      (age 62.0 +/- 8.7, 9F/10 M) were studied. The analysis did not reveal differences\\n      in blood gasses between NIV modalities, but a longer expiratory time (3.01+/-0.6 \\n      vs 2.8 +/- 0.6 s, respectively APCV vs ACV, p = 0.001) and a lower arousal index \\n      (17.5 +/- 9.1 vs 23.1 +/- 13.9, p = 0.02) during APCV. HRV was indicative of\\n      higher vagal activity during APCV, especially in the 5-minute periods. In the\\n      total sleep periods, the HRV time domain indexes reflecting parasympathetic\\n      activity were positively correlated with the expiratory time and negatively with \\n      the inspiratory/expiratory time ratio. Low frequencies were positively, and high \\n      frequencies negatively, correlated with inspiratory time. HRV and sleep structure\\n      parameters were not correlated, except very low frequencies that were correlated \\n      to the arousal index. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory influences on autonomic control\\n      can be preserved in ALS. The slower breathing pattern during APCV may help to\\n      maintain a higher vagal activity. Through this mechanism, in the long-term APCV\\n      could more beneficial to ALS patients than ACV.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

There\\n      has been no ideal effective treatment so far. The NX210 peptide is derived from\\n      the thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) sequence of SCO-spondin, and has been\\n      reported to exert various neurogenic properties. This study investigated whether \\n      NX210 had therapeutic effects and possible underlying mechanisms against cerebral\\n      ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Therefore, primary embryonic rat cortical neurons and\\n      Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats that were subjected to oxygen-glucose\\n      deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and middle cerebral artery\\n      occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) injuries, respectively, were treated with or\\n      without NX210. We found that NX210 reduced OGD/R-induced cell viability loss and \\n      cytotoxicity. NX210 decreased cerebral infarct volume and brain edema,\\n      ameliorated neurological dysfunction, attenuated oxidative stress damage, and\\n      diminished neuronal apoptosis in MCAO/R rats. Furthermore, western blot analysis \\n      shown that treatment with NX210 up-regulated the expression of Integrin-beta1,\\n      phosphorylated-PI3K (p-PI3K) and phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt). The Integrin-beta1\\n      specific inhibitor, ATN-161, was used to identify pathways involved. The\\n      anti-oxidation activities and anti-apoptosis of NX210 was reversed by treatment\\n      with ATN-161. Overall, our results indicated that NX210 prevents oxidative stress\\n      and neuronal apoptosis in cerebral I/R via upregulation of the\\n      Integrin-beta1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These results indicated that NX210 may\\n      be a promising therapeutic candidate for ischemic stroke.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

MME\\n      evaluation during walking is a key method of detecting dynamic changes in the\\n      meniscus, and in combination with motion analysis, can provide a deeper\\n      understanding of the mechanisms involved in the increase of MME. OBJECTIVE: To\\n      validate the feasibility of MME dynamic evaluation in combination with a motion\\n      analysis system based on the correlation between the increase in MME and\\n      biomechanical factors. METHODS: Twenty-three knees from 23 patients with mild to \\n      moderate knee OA were analysed in this study. The medial meniscus during walking \\n      was evaluated by ultrasound. The increase in MME was calculated as the difference\\n      between the minimum and maximum MME during walking. A three-dimensional motion\\n      analysis system was synchronised with the ultrasound and then, biomechanical\\n      factors such as knee moment and ground reaction force were evaluated. RESULTS:\\n      The wave patterns of the mediolateral and vertical components of ground reaction \\n      forces and knee adduction moment were similar to those in the MME based on a high\\n      cross-correlation coefficient (>0.8). The increase in MME was significantly\\n      correlated with the peak value of the knee adduction moment (r = 0.54, P =\\n      0.0073) but not with the mediolateral and vertical components of the ground\\n      reaction force. CONCLUSION: The findings show that knee adduction moment is\\n      correlated with an increase in MME during walking and indicates the validity and \\n      feasibility of the dynamic evaluation of MME in combination with a motion\\n      analysis system.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In this study the Segond fracture is used as a surrogate for an\\n      anterolateral complex injury to determine if there is an association between\\n      Segond fracture and increased posterior tibial slope. METHODS: Patients\\' charts\\n      and radiographs were analyzed retrospectively for the presence of Segond\\n      fractures on injury radiographs. These patients, the Segond cohort, were then age\\n      and gender matched to a control cohort. Demographic as well MRI measurements of\\n      medial and lateral posterior tibial slope and lateral-to-medial slope asymmetry\\n      were collected for each cohort. Secondary outcome of anterior cruciate ligament\\n      reconstruction failure data was also collected. RESULTS: The Segond group\\n      demonstrated a statistically significantly greater lateral posterior tibial slope\\n      (8.42 degrees versus 6.55 degrees , P = 0.003) as well as medial posterior tibial\\n      slope (6.57 degrees versus 5.34 degrees degrees, P = 0.045). There was no\\n      significant differences between lateral-to-medial asymmetry (2.18 degrees versus \\n      1.83 degrees , P = 0.246). CONCLUSION: Patients with Segond fractures at the time\\n      of anterior cruciate ligament injury have increased medial and lateral posterior \\n      tibial slope. This may relate to increased rotational and translational\\n      instability associated with anterolateral complex injuries.

The hypothesis is\\n      that a thin tibial tuberosity osteotomy shows high axial load resistance of the\\n      tibia. METHODS: The OWDTO model was constructed from imitation bones of the\\n      tibia. Distal tibial tuberosity osteotomy was performed with thicknesses of 7,\\n      14, and 21 mm (n = 5 for each group). Cyclic axial-load fatigue tests were\\n      performed to investigate the strain at five measurement points on the OWDTO\\n      model. An axial-load failure test was also performed to investigate the maximum\\n      strain for failure. RESULTS: The 7-mm OWDTO model showed a significantly lower\\n      stain range than the 14-mm model at the middle part of the lateral hinge (P =\\n      0.0263, mean difference: -852.6 muepsilon), posterior part (P = 0.0465, mean\\n      difference: -1040.0 muepsilon), posterior tibial cortex (P < 0.0001, mean\\n      difference: -583.4 muepsilon), and plate (P = 0.0029, mean difference: -121.6\\n      muepsilon). There were no significant differences in the strain at the tibial\\n      tuberosity between the groups. The axial load for complete failure was\\n      significantly higher in the 7-mm model than in the 21-mm model (P = 0.0010, mean \\n      difference: 2577.0 N). The failure points were at the lateral hinges.\\n      CONCLUSIONS: Thinner distal tibial tuberosity osteotomy is more resistant to\\n      axial load and may be recommended for the prevention of tibial and lateral hinge \\n      fractures after OWDTO.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Controversies remain about whether the clinical\\n      presentation is due to direct organ damage by SARS-CoV-2 or secondary effects,\\n      such as overshooting immune response. SARS-CoV-2 detection in tissues by RT-qPCR \\n      and immunohistochemistry (IHC) or electron microscopy (EM) can help answer these \\n      questions, but a comprehensive evaluation of these applications is missing.\\n      METHODS: We assessed publications using IHC and EM for SARS-CoV-2 detection in\\n      autopsy tissues. We systematically evaluated commercially available antibodies\\n      against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins in cultured cell lines and COVID-19 autopsy\\n      tissues. In a multicentre study, we evaluated specificity, reproducibility, and\\n      inter-observer variability of SARS-CoV-2 IHC. We correlated RT-qPCR viral tissue \\n      loads with semiquantitative IHC scoring. We used qualitative and quantitative EM \\n      analyses to refine criteria for ultrastructural identification of SARS-CoV-2.\\n      FINDINGS: Publications show high variability in detection and interpretation of\\n      SARS-CoV-2 abundance in autopsy tissues by IHC or EM. We show that IHC using\\n      antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid yields the highest sensitivity and\\n      specificity. We found a positive correlation between presence of viral proteins\\n      by IHC and RT-qPCR-determined SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (N= 35; r=-0.83, p-value \\n      <0.0001). For EM, we refined criteria for virus identification and provide\\n      recommendations for optimized sampling and analysis. 135 of 144 publications\\n      misinterpret cellular structures as virus using EM or show only insufficient\\n      data. We provide publicly accessible digitized EM sections as a reference and for\\n      training purposes. INTERPRETATION: Since detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human autopsy\\n      tissues by IHC and EM is difficult and frequently incorrect, we propose criteria \\n      for a re-evaluation of available data and guidance for further investigations of \\n      direct organ effects by SARS-CoV-2.

Plasma EETs are mostly esterified to phospholipids and \\n      part of an active pool. To address the limited information about EETs and CVD in \\n      humans, we conducted a prospective study of total plasma EETs (free + esterified)\\n      and diabetes-related CVD in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). METHODS: We\\n      measured 4 EET species and their metabolites, dihydroxyepoxyeicosatrienoic acids \\n      (DHETs), in plasma samples from 892 CHS participants with type 2 diabetes. We\\n      determined the association of EETs and DHETs with incident myocardial infarction \\n      (MI) and ischemic stroke using Cox regression. FINDINGS: During follow-up (median\\n      7.5 years), we identified 150 MI and 134 ischemic strokes. In primary,\\n      multivariable analyses, elevated levels of each EET species were associated with \\n      non-significant lower risk of incident MI (for example, hazard ratio for 1 SD\\n      higher 14,15-EET: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.72-1.02; p=0.08). The EETs-MI associations\\n      became significant in analyses further adjusted for DHETs (hazard ratio for 1 SD \\n      higher 14,15-EET adjusted for 14,15-DHET: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63-0.91; p=0.004).\\n      Elevated EET levels were associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke in\\n      primary but not secondary analyses. Three DHET species were associated with\\n      higher risk of ischemic stroke in all analyses. INTERPRETATION: Findings from\\n      this prospective study complement the extensive studies in animal models showing \\n      EETs protect cardiac function and provide new information in humans. Replication \\n      is needed to confirm the associations. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Woody tree species may play a crucial role in the\\n      removal of heavy metals from soil and air, thus minimizing pollution potential.\\n      The present study was designed to evaluate the phytoremediation potential of six \\n      tree species; Azadirachta indica, Cassia fistula, Conocarpus erectus, Eucalyptus \\n      camaldulensis, Morus alba, and Populus deltoids, respectively, in the industrial \\n      and residential areas of Faisalabad based on the concentrations of lead (Pb),\\n      zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and copper (Cu) in their leaves and barks in winter\\n      (2018) and summer (2019) seasons. The seasonal contents of heavy metals in both\\n      the leaves and barks of these trees decreased in the order of: Zn > Pb > Cu > Cd \\n      at both study sites. The highest heavy metal contents were recorded in the leaves\\n      and barks of trees grown in the industrial areas as compared to residential\\n      areas, with leaves and barks having higher contents of heavy metals in the summer\\n      than winter. The tree species exhibited significantly different capacity for\\n      heavy metal accumulation, with the accumulation of Cd decreased in the order of: \\n      E. camaldulensis > M. alba > C. erectus > A. indica > P. deltoids > C. fistula,\\n      and while the order varied for different heavy metals. Overall, M. alba, E.\\n      camaldulensis and A. indica performed well in accumulating the targeted heavy\\n      metals from the ambient environment. Among the six tree species grown commonly in\\n      Faisalabad city, M. alba, E. camaldulensis, and A. indica are recommended for the\\n      industrial and residential areas due to their phytoremediation capacity for heavy\\n      metals.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, many residents work in\\n      informal labor markets that have been affected by the lockdowns, resulting in\\n      further reductions in access to resources, including clean water. This study uses\\n      a cross-sectional design (n = 532) to examine the vulnerabilities of households\\n      to employment and business disruptions, water access and hygiene practices during\\n      the COVID-19 lockdowns between April and June 2020 in three informal settlements \\n      in Nairobi, Kenya. We used survey questions from the Household Water Insecurity\\n      Experience Scale (HWISE) to investigate the relationship between employment and\\n      business disruptions, water access, and hygiene practices (i.e., hand washing,\\n      body washing, clothes washing, and being able to use or drink clean water). Of\\n      the sampled households, 96% were forced to reduce work hours during the\\n      lockdowns, and these households had 92% lower odds of being able to afford water \\n      than households who did not experience a work hour reduction (OR = 0.08, p <\\n      .001). Household challenges in affording water were likely due to a combination\\n      of reduced household income, increased water prices, and pre-existing poverty,\\n      and were ultimately associated with lower hygiene scores (Beta = 1.9, p < .001). \\n      Our results highlight a compounding tragedy of reduced water access in informal\\n      settlements that were already facing water insecurities at a time when water is a\\n      fundamental requirement for following hygiene guidelines to reduce disease burden\\n      during an ongoing pandemic. These outcomes emphasize the need for targeted\\n      investments in permanent water supply infrastructures and improved hygiene\\n      behaviors as a public health priority among households in informal settlements.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite years of intense\\n      research, the hypothesis was never tested in a double-blinded and\\n      placebo-controlled intervention trial. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to perform the first\\n      placebo-controlled double-blinded test that investigates the effect of\\n      biodiversity on immune tolerance. METHODS: In the intervention group, children\\n      aged 3-5 years were exposed to playground sand enriched with microbially diverse \\n      soil, or in the placebo group, visually similar, but microbially poor sand\\n      colored with peat (13 participants per treatment group). Children played twice a \\n      day for 20 min in the sandbox for 14 days. Sand, skin and gut bacterial, and\\n      blood samples were taken at baseline and after 14 days. Bacterial changes were\\n      followed for 28 days. Sand, skin and gut metagenome was determined by high\\n      throughput sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene. Cytokines were measured from\\n      plasma and the frequency of blood regulatory T cells was defined as a percentage \\n      of total CD3 +CD4 + T cells. RESULTS: Bacterial richness (P < 0.001) and\\n      diversity (P < 0.05) were higher in the intervention than placebo sand. Skin\\n      bacterial community, including Gammaproteobacteria, shifted only in the\\n      intervention treatment to resemble the bacterial community in the enriched sand\\n      (P < 0.01). Mean change in plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration and IL-10 \\n      to IL-17A ratio supported immunoregulation in the intervention treatment compared\\n      to the placebo treatment (P = 0.02). IL-10 levels (P = 0.001) and IL-10 to IL-17A\\n      ratio (P = 0.02) were associated with Gammaproteobacterial community on the skin.\\n      The change in Treg frequencies was associated with the relative abundance of skin\\n      Thermoactinomycetaceae 1 (P = 0.002) and unclassified Alphaproteobacteria (P <\\n      0.001). After 28 days, skin bacterial community still differed in the\\n      intervention treatment compared to baseline (P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This is the \\n      first double-blinded placebo-controlled study to show that daily exposure to\\n      microbial biodiversity is associated with immune modulation in humans. The\\n      findings support the biodiversity hypothesis of immune-mediated diseases. We\\n      conclude that environmental microbiota may contribute to child health, and that\\n      adding microbiological diversity to everyday living environment may support\\n      immunoregulation.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

Infants\\'\\n      ankyloglossia severity was evaluated using the Coryllos(R) ankyloglossia\\n      tongue-tie grading scale. Each mother completed a pre-procedure questionnaire\\n      where breastfeeding efficiency was evaluated using the LATCH(R) criteria. Each\\n      mother also reported a numeric score of pain with feeding, breastfeeding time,\\n      and a perceived feeding efficiency score. After the tongue-tie release procedure,\\n      each mother completed a post-procedure questionnaire within a 1-week to 1-month\\n      window to assess the change in breastfeeding efficiency using the LATCH(R)\\n      criteria, breastfeeding pain, breastfeeding time, and perceived breastfeeding\\n      efficiency. RESULTS: 41 mother-infant dyads participated in the study. No\\n      surgical complications occurred during or post-procedure. All dyads reported\\n      improved (40) or equal (1) LATCH(R) scores: with a mean improved LATCH(R) score\\n      of 3.2 points (p < 4^10(-15), 95% CI 2.6, 3.7.). The mean improved maternal\\n      perception of feeding was 3.3 points (p < 6^10(-10),95% CI 2.6, 4.0.), the mean\\n      decreased maternal pain was 4.0 points (p < 1^10(-14), 95% CI 3.3, 4.8), and the \\n      mean decreased maternal feeding time was 0.80 points (p = 0.002, 95% CI 0.5,\\n      1.1.). CONCLUSION: Lingual frenulum release procedures appear to consistently\\n      improve breastfeeding efficiency and decrease maternal pain.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Despite recent appreciable improvements\\n      in treatment plans for patients with NSCLC, the prognosis for those with the\\n      cancer still remains poor. Recently, a growing number of studies have shown that \\n      N-myristoyltransferases (NMTs) may be critical in carcinogenesis, however, the\\n      functional and clinical significance of this pathway in NSCLC remains unclear and\\n      requires further research. METHODS: Initially, we evaluated the expression levels\\n      of NMT1 or NMT2 in a clinical cohort comprising of 303 paired primary NSCLC\\n      tissues and matched normal mucosae by using ELISA. We subsequently performed a\\n      tissue microarray analysis (TMA) to confirm its expression pattern in an\\n      independent validation cohort (n = 78). Then, we used a publicly available KM\\n      plotter database (n = 1921) to evaluate the prognostic impact of NMT1 and NMT2 in\\n      NSCLC. Lastly, a series of in-vitro molecular/cellular and animal experiments\\n      were performed for mechanistic understanding of the role of\\n      N-myristoyltransferases in NSCLC. RESULTS: Our ELISA data revealed that the\\n      expression level of NMT1 and NMT2 was down-regulated in tumor tissues (n = 303, P\\n      < 0.0001), which was confirmed in an independent validation cohort by TMA (n =\\n      78, P = 0.014 for NMT1 and P < 0.0001 for NMT2). On the other hand, patients with\\n      low expression of NMT1 or NMT2 had shorter overall survival (P = 0.013, HR = 0.85\\n      for NMT1; P = 0.00059, HR = 0.8, for NMT2). Mechanistically, we revealed that the\\n      interaction and co-localization of NMT1 and NMT2 in NSCLC, and N-terminus of NMT1\\n      and NMT2 was observed to be crucial for their interaction as well as for their\\n      catalytic activity. Moreover, we found that NMT1 can significantly promote the\\n      expression of NMT2 by enhancing its stability. We corroborated these findings by \\n      performing functional assays in which the knockout of NMT1 and NMT2 resulted in\\n      enhanced cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as increased\\n      tumorxenograftgrowth. In addition, we identified miR-182 as a novel regulator of \\n      both NMT1 and NMT2. More specifically, the overexpression or inhibition of\\n      miR-182 modulated globe N-myristoylation level, contributed to phenotypic\\n      alterations in NSCLS cells. CONCLUSIONS: NMT1 and NMT2 can act as potential tumor\\n      suppressors in NSCLC, and the inhibition of miR-182 expression or therapeutic\\n      NMTs replenishment may be a promising treatment option for patients with NSCLC.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The accepted pathogenetic model is \\n      a complex network including SOX2, SOX17, OCT3/4 and PRAME, which modulates the\\n      epigenetic transcription of numerous downstream genes and drives a divergent gene\\n      expression profile resulting in the transition from pure S (P-S) to S component\\n      (S-C) of mixed germ cell tumors of the testis (M-GCTT), and finally to embryonal \\n      carcinoma (EC). Herein, we tested a large cohort of GCTT with SOX2 and PRAME to\\n      evaluate their expression in the evolutionary steps of GCTT and verify if the\\n      modulation in the expression of these two molecules could be relevant for the\\n      fate of GCTT. METHODS: We tested 43, 19 and 17 consecutive and retrospectively\\n      enrolled cases of GCTT, germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) and uninvolved\\n      background testes (UBT), respectively. SOX2 and PRAME expressions have been\\n      evaluated with H-score and compared by adopting the appropriate statistic tests\\n      (Student\\'s t-test and Mann-Whitney U test). RESULTS: We found that SOX2 was more \\n      expressed by nonseminomatous-GCTT (NS-GCTT) (p < 0.001) and EC (p < 0.001) rather\\n      than S; by contrast, PRAME showed an opposite expression profile being expressed \\n      by S but not by NS-GCTT (p < 0.001) and EC (p < 0.001).

Surgical resection is the\\n      cornerstone of treatment; however, optimal factors regarding the extent of\\n      fibrosarcoma resection in localized versus regional disease is poorly understood.\\n      METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for\\n      patients who are 19 y old or younger with a diagnosis of fibrosarcoma from 1975\\n      to 2016. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed for disease-specific survival on\\n      clinical and pathologic variables. Multivariate analysis was performed based on\\n      significant predictors of disease-specific survival. RESULTS: There were 1290\\n      patients (median age 13 [7-17] y) identified with fibrosarcoma. The overall\\n      survival rate at 20 y was 93%. Radical resection was performed on 22%, 40%, and\\n      52% of patients with localized, regional, and distant Surveillance, Epidemiology,\\n      and End Results disease stage, respectively. Chemotherapy (P < 0.001), radiation \\n      (P < 0.001), histology (P < 0.001), and stage (P = 0.004) were significant\\n      predictors of increased mortality using univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis. Most\\n      patients (86%) with localized or regional stage who underwent radiation had\\n      fibrosarcomas of nondermatofibrosarcoma histology (P < 0.001).\\n      Dermatofibrosarcoma subtype comprised most radical resections (41%). Excluding\\n      distant stage, nondermatofibroma histology (hazard ratio 16.94, 95% confidence\\n      interval 3.77-76.01) and regional stage (hazard ratio 8.15, 95% confidence\\n      interval 2.93-22.69) were independent prognostic factors of mortality (both P <\\n      0.001). Radical resection was not a significant independent prognostic indicator \\n      of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Nondermatofibrosarcoma subtype is independently\\n      associated with increased mortality. Although surgery remains the mainstay of\\n      treatment, the extent of resection is not a predictor of survival for patients\\n      with the localized and regional stage of disease.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Anxiety, menstrual distress\\n      (i.e., pain, behavior change, autonomic reaction, fluid retention, and negative\\n      affect) and profile of mood (i.e., tension, depression, and anger) were measured \\n      before exercise. Arousal, heart rate (HR), motivation, rating of perceived\\n      exertion and affective valence were measured before, during and after each\\n      exercise session. Results: Anger, anxiety, behavior change, pain, and negative\\n      affect were significantly greater (p < .05) during menstruation compared to the\\n      mid-follicular phase, whereas fluid retention, anger, behavior change, and\\n      autonomic reaction were greater (p < .05) during the late luteal phase compared\\n      with the mid-follicular phase. Participants felt more negative affective valence \\n      and less motivation to start exercise during menstruation compared with other MC \\n      phases. Average treadmill speed (5.8 +/- 1.1 vs 6.0 +/- 0.7 vs 5.9 +/- 0.7\\n      km/h(-1), p = .36) and %HRmax (74.9 +/- 3.2 vs 77.8 +/- 5.4 vs 77.4 +/- 7.1%, p =\\n      .40) did not differ between menstruation, mid-follicular, and late luteal phases.\\n      Also, noteworthy is that participants self-selected an intensity that exceeded\\n      the minimum levels recommended for health and cardiorespiratory fitness promotion\\n      (64-70% HRmax).

The purpose of this study was to assess whether\\n      race is an independent risk factor for patients with cerebral palsy to undergo a \\n      salvage hip procedure or experience postoperative complications for hip dysplasia\\n      treatment. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis utilizing the\\n      American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program\\n      (NSQIP) Pediatric database from 2012 to 2019. International Classification of\\n      Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modifications (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM),\\n      and current procedural terminology (CPT) codes were used to identify patients\\n      with cerebral palsy undergoing hip procedures for hip dysplasia and to stratify\\n      patients into salvage or reconstructive surgeries. RESULTS: There was a total of \\n      3906 patients with cerebral palsy between the ages of 2 and 18 years undergoing a\\n      procedure for hip dysplasia, including 1995 (51.1%) White patients, 768 (19.7%)\\n      Black patients, and 1143 (29.3%) patients from other races. Both Black (P=0.044) \\n      and White (P=0.046) races were significantly associated with undergoing a salvage\\n      versus a reconstructive hip procedure, with Black patients having an increased\\n      risk compared to White patients [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.77, confidence\\n      interval (CI) 1.02-3.07]. Only Black patients were found to have an increased\\n      risk of any postoperative complication compared to White patients, with an\\n      adjusted OR of 1.26 (CI 1.02-1.56; P=0.033). Both White (P=0.017) and black\\n      (P=0.004) races were found to be significantly associated with medical\\n      complications, with Black patients having an increased risk (adjusted OR 1.43, CI\\n      1.12-1.84) compared to White patients. There were no significant findings between\\n      the race and risk of surgical site complications, unplanned readmissions, or\\n      reoperations. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patient race is an\\n      independent association for the risk of pediatric patients with cerebral palsy to\\n      both undergo a salvage hip procedure and to experience postoperative medical\\n      complications, with Black patients having an increased risk compared to White.\\n      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III Retrospective Cohort Study.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Yet, few studies investigate the relationship\\n      between depression and relocation factors that might help identify at-risk\\n      residents, such as previous location. This study analyzed cross-sectional\\n      resident data (n = 2651) from the National Survey of Residential Care Facilities \\n      to test: (1) group differences between residents relocating from acute/post-acute\\n      facilities (e.g., hospital, rehabilitation facility) and community-based\\n      residences, and (2) the relationship between previous location and depression\\n      within the first year of relocation.

ANIMALS: 12 purpose-bred adult sexually intact female\\n      Beagles. PROCEDURES: Dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups:\\n      grapiprant (2 mg/kg, PO; n = 6) or carprofen (4.4 mg/kg, PO; n = 6), 1.5 hours\\n      prior to ovariohysterectomy (OVH) and every 24 hours afterward for 3 total doses.\\n      An ultrafiltration probe was placed within the OVH incision to collect\\n      interstitial fluid (ISF).

ANIMALS: 6 healthy \\n      young adult purpose-bred research cats. PROCEDURES: Baseline renal cortical\\n      biopsies, whole blood, serum, and urine were collected prior to administration of\\n      a commercial FVRCP parenteral vaccine. Vaccine hyperinoculation was defined as a \\n      total of 8 vaccinations given at 2-week intervals over a 14-week period. Blood\\n      samples were collected immediately prior to each vaccination, and a second renal \\n      biopsy was performed 2 weeks after hyperinoculation (week 16). Renal\\n      histopathology, renal alpha-enolase immunohistochemistry, and assays to detect\\n      humoral and cell-mediated immune reactions against Crandell-Rees feline kidney\\n      (CRFK) cell lysates and alpha-enolase were performed.

SAMPLE: Paired GTs from 12 adult dog cadavers and 4 control\\n      GT. PROCEDURES: GTs were assigned to 2 groups (n = 12/group). Transverse tenotomy\\n      was performed and repaired with a DK or DK + ES. Yield, peak, and failure force, \\n      stiffness, occurrence of 1-and 3-mm gapping, and failure mode were examined.\\n      RESULTS: Yield, peak, and failure loads were greater for DK + ES. Yield force was\\n      48% greater for DK + ES (mean +/- SD, 149.56 +/- 53.26 N) versus DK (101.27 +/-\\n      37.17 N; P = 0.017). Peak force was 45% greater for DK + ES P < 0.001).

Suture breakage occurred \\n      in all DK repairs, which differed from DK + ES, where suture breakage (7/12) and \\n      tissue failure (5/12; P = 0.037) predominated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Augmentation\\n      of a primary DK repair with an ES significantly improved construct strength in\\n      canine GT constructs while increasing loads required to cause 1- and 3-mm gap\\n      formation, respectively.

Several labor sectors had to undergo a virtual adaptation\\n      process resulting in job instability and job loss. The objective of this study\\n      was to revalidate an ultra-short scale for measuring perceived job security in\\n      Latin America. Methods: A revalidation study was done on a short scale that\\n      measures worker\\'s perceived security about losing or keeping their job in the\\n      near future. Results: The four items remained on the revalidated scale, where all\\n      four explained a single factor. The goodness-of-fit measures confirmed the\\n      single-factor model (chi: 7.06; df: 2; p = 0.29; mean square error: 0.015;\\n      goodness-of-fit index: 0.998; adjusted goodness-of-fit index: 0.991; comparative \\n      fit index: 0.999; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.997; normalized fit index: 0.998;\\n      incremental fit index: 0.999; and root mean square error of approximation:\\n      0.036). The scale\\'s reliability was calculated using McDonald\\'s omega\\n      coefficient, obtaining an overall result of omega = 0.72.

Here, we develop a platform for\\n      fluorescence imaging of bulk RNA dynamics in living cells. We show that\\n      fluorescent bicyclic and tricyclic cytidine analogues can be metabolically\\n      incorporated into cellular RNA by overexpression of uridine-cytidine kinase 2. In\\n      particular, metabolic feeding with the tricyclic cytidine-derived nucleoside tC\\n      combined with confocal imaging enables the investigation of RNA synthesis,\\n      degradation, and trafficking at single-cell resolution. We apply our imaging\\n      modality to study RNA metabolism and localization during the oxidative stress\\n      response and find that bulk RNA turnover is greatly accelerated upon NaAsO2\\n      treatment. Furthermore, we identify cytoplasmic RNA granules containing RNA\\n      transcripts generated during oxidative stress that are distinct from canonical\\n      stress granules and P-bodies and co-localize with the RNA helicase DDX6.

We hypothesized that PBI was noninferior to WBI regarding breast\\n      induration. METHODS: Patients operated with breast conservation for relatively\\n      low-risk breast cancer were randomly assigned to WBI versus PBI, and all had 40\\n      Gy/15 fractions. The primary end point was 3-year grade 2-3 breast induration.\\n      RESULTS: In total, 865 evaluable patients (434 WBI and 431 PBI) were enrolled\\n      between 2009 and 2016. Median follow-up was 5.0 years (morbidity) and 7.6 years\\n      (locoregional recurrence). The 3-year rate of induration was 9.7% for WBI and\\n      5.1% for PBI, P = .014. Large breast size was significantly associated with\\n      induration with a 3-year incidence of 13% (WBI) and 6% (PBI) for large-breasted\\n      patients versus 6% (WBI) and 5% (PBI) for small-breasted patients. PBI showed no \\n      increased risk of dyspigmentation, telangiectasia, edema, or pain, and patient\\n      satisfaction was high. Letrozole and smoking did not increase the risk of\\n      radiation-associated morbidity. Sixteen patients had a locoregional recurrence\\n      (six WBI and 10 PBI), P = .28, 20 patients had a contralateral breast cancer, and\\n      eight patients had distant failure (five WBI and three PBI). A nonbreast second\\n      cancer was detected in 73 patients (8.4%), and there was no difference between\\n      groups. CONCLUSION: External-beam PBI for patients with low-risk breast cancer\\n      was noninferior to WBI in terms of breast induration. Large breast size was a\\n      risk factor for radiation-associated induration. Few recurrences were detected\\n      and unrelated to PBI.\\nFAU - Offersen, Birgitte V\\nAU  - Offersen BV\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7356-2096\\nAD  - Department of Experimental Clinical Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus,\\n      Denmark.\\nAD  - Department of Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.\\nFAU - Alsner, Jan\\nAU  - Alsner J\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-5395-3193\\nAD  - Department of Experimental Clinical Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus,\\n      Denmark.\\nFAU - Nielsen, Hanne M\\nAU  - Nielsen HM\\nAD  - Department of Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.\\nFAU - Jakobsen, Erik H\\nAU  - Jakobsen EH\\nAD  - Department of Oncology, Lillebaelt Hospital, Vejle, Denmark.\\nFAU - Nielsen, Mette H\\nAU  - Nielsen MH\\nAD  - Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.\\nFAU - Stenbygaard, Lars\\nAU  - Stenbygaard L\\nAD  - Department of Oncology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.\\nFAU - Pedersen, Anders N\\nAU  - Pedersen AN\\nAD  - Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet,\\n      Copenhagen, Denmark.\\nFAU - Thomsen, Mette S\\nAU  - Thomsen MS\\nAD  - Department of Medical Physics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.\\nFAU - Yates, Esben\\nAU  - Yates E\\nAD  - Department of Medical Physics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.\\nFAU - Berg, Martin\\nAU  - Berg M\\nAD  - Department of Medical Physics, Lillebaelt Hospital, Vejle, Denmark.\\nFAU - Lorenzen, Ebbe L\\nAU  - Lorenzen EL\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-1895-733X\\nAD  - Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.\\nFAU - Jensen, Ingelise\\nAU  - Jensen I\\nAD  - Department of Medical Physics, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.\\nFAU - Josipovic, Mirjana\\nAU  - Josipovic M\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8288-162X\\nAD  - Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet,\\n      Copenhagen, Denmark.\\nFAU - Jensen, Maj-Britt\\nAU  - Jensen MB\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5348-3040\\nAD  - Danish Breast Cancer Group, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet,\\n      Copenhagen, Denmark.\\nFAU - Overgaard, Jens\\nAU  - Overgaard J\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0814-8179\\nAD  - Department of Experimental Clinical Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus,\\n      Denmark.\\nCN  - Danish Breast Cancer Group Radiotherapy Committee\\nLA  - eng\\nSI  - ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00892814\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - J Clin Oncol\\nJT  - Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of\\n      Clinical Oncology\\nJID - 8309333\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 16:03\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 16:03 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1200/JCO.22.00451 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Clin Oncol. 2022 Aug 5:JCO2200451. doi: 10.1200/JCO.22.00451.\\n\\nPMID- 35930751\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2688-1535 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2688-1527 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities in Delay to Initiation of\\n      Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy.\\nPG  - OP2200104\\nLID - 10.1200/OP.22.00104 [doi]\\nAB  - PURPOSE: Delays in initiation of radiotherapy may contribute to inferior\\n      oncologic outcomes that are more commonly observed in minoritized populations in \\n      the United States. We aimed to examine inequities associated with delayed\\n      initiation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The\\n      National Cancer Database was queried to identify the 10 cancer sites most\\n      commonly treated with IMRT. Interval to initiation of treatment (IIT) was broken \\n      into quartiles for each disease site, with the 4(th) quartile classified as\\n      delayed. Multivariable logistic regression for delayed IIT was performed for each\\n      disease site using clinical and demographic covariates. Differences in magnitude \\n      of delay between subsets of patients stratified by race and insurance status were\\n      evaluated using two-sample t-tests. RESULTS: Among patients (n = 350,425) treated\\n      with IMRT between 2004 and 2017, non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, and Asian\\n      patients were significantly more likely to have delayed IIT with IMRT for nearly \\n      all disease sites compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients. NHB, Hispanic,\\n      and Asian patients had significantly longer median IIT than NHW patients (NHB 87 \\n      days, P < .01; Hispanic 76 days, P < .01; Asian 74 days, P < .01; and NHW 67\\n      days). NHW, Hispanic, and Asian patients with private insurance had shorter\\n      median IIT than those with Medicare (P < .01); however, NHB patients with private\\n      insurance had longer IIT than those with Medicare (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Delays\\n      in initiation of IMRT in NHB, Hispanic, and Asian patients may contribute to the \\n      known differences in cancer outcomes and warrant further investigation,\\n      particularly to further clarify the role of different insurance policies in\\n      delays in advanced modality radiotherapy.\\nFAU - Hutten, Ryan J\\nAU  - Hutten RJ\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-1789-0391\\nAD  - Department of Radiation Oncology, Huntsman Cancer Hospital, University of Utah,\\n      Salt Lake City, UT.\\nFAU - Weil, Christopher R\\nAU  - Weil CR\\nAD  - Department of Radiation Oncology, Huntsman Cancer Hospital, University of Utah,\\n      Salt Lake City, UT.\\nFAU - Gaffney, David K\\nAU  - Gaffney DK\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-5752-1611\\nAD  - Department of Radiation Oncology, Huntsman Cancer Hospital, University of Utah,\\n      Salt Lake City, UT.\\nFAU - Kokeny, Kristine\\nAU  - Kokeny K\\nAD  - Department of Radiation Oncology, Huntsman Cancer Hospital, University of Utah,\\n      Salt Lake City, UT.\\nFAU - Lloyd, Shane\\nAU  - Lloyd S\\nAD  - Department of Radiation Oncology, Huntsman Cancer Hospital, University of Utah,\\n      Salt Lake City, UT.\\nFAU - Rogers, Charles R\\nAU  - Rogers CR\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3571-8229\\nAD  - Department of Family & Preventive Medicine, University of Utah School of\\n      Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.\\nFAU - Suneja, Gita\\nAU  - Suneja G\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-5933-211X\\nAD  - Department of Radiation Oncology, Huntsman Cancer Hospital, University of Utah,\\n      Salt Lake City, UT.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - JCO Oncol Pract\\nJT  - JCO oncology practice\\nJID - 101758685\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 16:02\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 16:02 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1200/OP.22.00104 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - JCO Oncol Pract. 2022 Aug 5:OP2200104. doi: 10.1200/OP.22.00104.\\n\\nPMID- 35930739\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1538-8514 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1535-7163 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Transient Inhibition of Trastuzumab-Tumor Binding to Overcome the \"Binding-Site\\n      Barrier\" and Improve the Efficacy of a Trastuzumab-Gelonin Immunotoxin.\\nLID - MCT-22-0192 [pii]\\nLID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-22-0192 [doi]\\nAB  - We have recently shown that co-administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with\\n      anti-idiotypic distribution enhancers (AIDEs) that inhibit mAb binding to tumor\\n      antigens enabled increased intra-tumoral mAb distribution and increased efficacy \\n      of an antibody-drug conjugate (trastuzumab emtansine, T-DM1). In the present\\n      work, a PK/PD model was applied to predict the impact of this optimization\\n      strategy on the within-tumor distribution and anti-tumor efficacy of\\n      trastuzumab-gelonin, where the released payload (gelonin) is expected to exhibit \\n      negligible bystander activity. Immunofluorescence histology was used to\\n      investigate trastuzumab-gelonin distribution in solid tumors following dosing\\n      with or without co-administration of anti-trastuzumab AIDEs. Anti-tumor efficacy \\n      of trastuzumab-gelonin, with or without co-administration of AIDEs, was also\\n      evaluated in tumor-bearing mice. Trastuzumab-gelonin efficiently induced\\n      cytotoxicity when applied to NCI-N87 cells in culture (IC50: 0.224+/-0.079 nM).\\n      PK/PD simulations predicted that anti-idiotypic single-domain antibodies AIDEs\\n      with dissociation rate constants between 0.03-0.2 hour-1 would provide optimal\\n      enhancement of trastuzumab-gelonin efficacy. LE8 and 1HE, anti-trastuzumab AIDEs,\\n      were selected for evaluation in vivo. Co-administration of trastuzumab-gelonin\\n      with the inhibitors increased the portion of tumor area that stained positive for\\n      trastuzumab-gelonin by 58% (p=0.0059). Additionally, LE8 or 1HE co-administration\\n      improved trastuzumab-gelonin efficacy in NCI-N87 xenograft bearing mice by\\n      increasing the percent increase in life span (%ILS) from 27.8% (for\\n      trastuzumab-gelonin administered alone) to 62.5% when administered with LE8\\n      (p=0.0007) or 83.3% (p=0.0007) when administered with 1HE. These findings support\\n      the hypothesis that transient, competitive inhibition of mAb-tumor binding can\\n      improve the intra-tumoral distribution and efficacy of immunotoxins when applied \\n      for treatment of solid tumors.\\nFAU - Chen, Ping\\nAU  - Chen P\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7549-7873\\nAD  - University at Buffalo, State University of New York, United States.\\nFAU - Bordeau, Brandon M\\nAU  - Bordeau BM\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3203-8498\\nAD  - University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, United\\n      States.\\nFAU - Zhang, Yu\\nAU  - Zhang Y\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3463-9403\\nAD  - University at Buffalo, State University of New York, United States.\\nFAU - Balthasar, Joseph P\\nAU  - Balthasar JP\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-6340-9370\\nAD  - University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, United\\n      States.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Mol Cancer Ther\\nJT  - Molecular cancer therapeutics\\nJID - 101132535\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 15:53\\nPHST- 2022/08/01 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/03/17 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/20 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 15:53 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 707517 [pii]\\nAID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-22-0192 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Mol Cancer Ther. 2022 Aug 5. pii: 707517. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-22-0192.\\n\\nPMID- 35930728\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2326-5205 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2326-5191 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - The impact of temporary methotrexate discontinuation for 1 week versus 2 weeks on\\n      seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\\nLID - 10.1002/art.42318 [doi]\\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether discontinuing methotrexate (MTX) for 1 week after\\n      seasonal influenza vaccination is non-inferior to discontinuing for 2 weeks in\\n      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: In this prospective randomized \\n      parallel-group multi-center non-inferiority trial study, RA patients on a stable \\n      dose of MTX were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 to hold MTX for 1 week or 2 \\n      weeks after receiving the quadrivalent 2021-2022 seasonal influenza vaccine\\n      containing H1N1, H3N2, B-Yamagata, and B-Victoria strains. The primary outcome\\n      was the proportion of patients with a satisfactory vaccine response, which was\\n      defined as >/=4-fold increase in hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers\\n      against two or more of the four vaccine strains 4 weeks after vaccination.\\n      RESULTS: The modified intention-to-treat population included 90 patients in the 1\\n      week MTX hold group and 88 patients in the 2 week MTX hold group. The MTX dose in\\n      the 1 week hold and the 2 week hold groups were 12.6 +/- 3.4 and 12.9 +/- 3.3\\n      mg/week, respectively. The proportion of satisfactory vaccine responses did not\\n      differ between the groups (68.9% vs. 75.0%, p = 0.364). The seroprotection rate\\n      and the fold increase in antibody titers to each of the four influenza antigens\\n      were similar between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Temporarily discontinuing MTX for 1\\n      week is non-inferior to MTX discontinuation for 2 weeks after vaccination to\\n      induce a satisfactory vaccine response to a seasonal influenza vaccine in\\n      patients with RA on a stable dose of MTX.

However, the effectiveness of\\n      such interventions for older adults with Parkinson\\'s disease (OAPD) remains\\n      unclear. METHODS: seven databases (Web of Science, Medline, Academic Search\\n      Premier, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO, PsychARTICLE and PubMed) were searched up to \\n      7 April 2022. We assessed mobility and balance performance between EbIs groups\\n      and control groups or traditional physical training interventions (TPTIs) groups \\n      by comparing the outcomes of the Timed Up and Go (TUG), 6-Minute Walk Test\\n      (6MWT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), gait velocity, stride length and Functional\\n      Gait Assessment (FGA). RESULTS: we scanned 1,190 articles and meta-analysed 19\\n      trials (sample size = 781). In general, the results revealed statistical\\n      differences between EbIs groups and TPTIs groups in the TUG [mean difference (MD)\\n      = -1.030 s; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -2.029 to -0.031; P = 0.043; high\\n      quality of evidence], 6MWT (MD = 63.483 m; 95% CI = 9.542 to 117.425; P = 0.021; \\n      moderate quality of evidence), BBS (MD = 2.129; 95% CI = -1.293 to 2.965; P <\\n      0.001; high quality of evidence) and FGA (MD = 2.099 95% CI = -0.306 to 3.893; P \\n      = 0.022; moderate quality of evidence). No significant difference was discovered \\n      between EbIs groups and TPTIs groups in enhancing gait velocity and stride\\n      length. CONCLUSIONS: EbIs are statistically better than TPTIs in improving OAPD\\'s\\n      performance in TUG, 6MWT, BBS and FGA, whereas only the change between EbIs and\\n      TPTIs in 6MWT can reach the value of minimal clinically important difference.\\n      Further studies are needed to better assess the effectiveness of exergaming-based\\n      interventions.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.

With regard to the nine FLP-related compounds, our DFT calculated\\n      results reveal that only Al/P-Rea and Ga/P-Rea can kinetically and\\n      thermodynamically precede the energetically feasible combination reactions with\\n      CS2 to form the five-membered heterocyclic adducts. Our activation strain model\\n      analyses on the nine aforementioned model molecules indicate that the atomic\\n      radius of the Lewis acceptor (G13) and the Lewis donor (G15) plays a role in\\n      controlling their barrier heights to obtain good orbital overlaps among\\n      G13/P-Rea, Ga/G15-Rea, and CS2. Our theoretical observations based on the energy \\n      decomposition analysis-natural orbitals for chemical valence (EDA-NOCV) approach \\n      strongly indicate that the donor-acceptor bonding (i.e., singlet-singlet bonding)\\n      rather than the electron-sharing bonding (i.e., triplet-triplet bonding) plays a \\n      central role in determining the bonding conditions of the transition states,\\n      G13/P-TS and Ga/G15-TS. In addition, the theoretical evidence obtained by the\\n      frontier molecular orbital theory and EDA-NOCV analyses reveals that the best\\n      description for the bonding natures of the combination reactions of\\n      intramolecular geminal G13/P-Rea and Ga/G15-Rea with CS2 is the lone pair(G15)\\n      --> p-pi*(C) interaction rather than the p-pi*(G13) <-- p-pi(S) interaction.\\n      Moreover, our present DFT computations concerning the calculated structures and\\n      corresponding relative energetics of the stationary points connected with the\\n      aforementioned sophisticated approaches are in accordance with the Hammond\\n      postulate.\\nFAU - Yang, Ming-Chung\\nAU  - Yang MC\\nAD  - Department of Applied Chemistry, National Chiayi University, Chiayi 60004,\\n      Taiwan.\\nFAU - Zhang, Zheng-Feng\\nAU  - Zhang ZF\\nAD  - Department of Applied Chemistry, National Chiayi University, Chiayi 60004,\\n      Taiwan.\\nFAU - Su, Ming-Der\\nAU  - Su MD\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-5847-4271\\nAD  - Department of Applied Chemistry, National Chiayi University, Chiayi 60004,\\n      Taiwan.\\nAD  - Department of Medicinal and Applied Chemistry, Kaohsiung Medical University,\\n      Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Inorg Chem\\nJT  - Inorganic chemistry\\nJID - 0366543\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 15:12\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 15:12 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c00259 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Inorg Chem. 2022 Aug 5. doi: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c00259.\\n\\nPMID- 35930698\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1547-8181 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0018-7208 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Evaluating Operator Training Performance Using Recurrence Quantification Analysis\\n      of Autocorrelation Transformed Eye Gaze Data.\\nPG  - 187208221116953\\nLID - 10.1177/00187208221116953 [doi]\\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to investigate the relationship between gaze\\n      behaviour dynamics and operator performance. BACKGROUND: Individuals differ in\\n      their approach when learning a new task often resulting in performance disparity.\\n      During training some individuals learn the structure and dynamics of the task and\\n      develop a systematic approach, whereas others may achieve the same result albeit \\n      with increased perceived workload, or indeed some may fail to achieve superior\\n      performance levels. Previous research has shown that comparing gaze of experts\\n      with novices can provide unique insights into cognitive functioning of superior\\n      performers. METHODS: Twenty-five individuals participated in a computer-based\\n      simulation task. The concept of coefficient of variation (CoV) of task scores was\\n      used to compute the participants\\' consistency of performance. Based on CoV, the\\n      cohort was split into two performance categories. The temporal patterns in\\n      participants gaze data were transformed using autocorrelation, and recurrence\\n      quantification analysis (RQA) was employed to analyse and quantify the patterns. \\n      RESULTS: A Mann-Whitney U analysis demonstrated significantly (p < .01) higher\\n      determinism, entropy and laminarity in the superior group compared to the\\n      moderate group. Pearson\\'s correlation revealed a significant (p < .01) negative\\n      correlation between the consistency of task performance (CoV) and the RQA\\n      measures. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that eye gaze dynamics can be used\\n      as an objective measure of performance. Participants classified as superior\\n      performers consistently demonstrated a systematic gaze activity which were in\\n      line with the task structure. APPLICATION: The methods presented here are\\n      applicable to observe and evaluate operators\\' strategic distribution of gaze.\\n      Specifically, for tactical monitoring and decision making in task environments\\n      where spatial locations of elements-of-interest vary continuously.\\nFAU - Veerabhadrappa, Rakesh\\nAU  - Veerabhadrappa R\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7653-2252\\nAD  - 206228Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria, Australia.\\nFAU - Hettiarachchi, Imali T\\nAU  - Hettiarachchi IT\\nAD  - 206228Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria, Australia.\\nFAU - Hanoun, Samer\\nAU  - Hanoun S\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8697-1515\\nAD  - 206228Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria, Australia.\\nFAU - Jia, Dawei\\nAU  - Jia D\\nAD  - 111604Defence Science and Technology Group, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\\nFAU - Hosking, Simon G\\nAU  - Hosking SG\\nAD  - 111604Defence Science and Technology Group, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\\nFAU - Bhatti, Asim\\nAU  - Bhatti A\\nAD  - 206228Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Victoria, Australia.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Hum Factors\\nJT  - Human factors\\nJID - 0374660\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - autocorrelation\\nOT  - eye-tracking\\nOT  - performance\\nOT  - recurrence quantification analysis\\nOT  - visual strategies\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 15:12\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 15:12 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1177/00187208221116953 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Hum Factors. 2022 Aug 5:187208221116953. doi: 10.1177/00187208221116953.\\n\\nPMID- 35930694\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2473-9537 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2473-9529 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Real-world effectiveness of caplacizumab vs standard of care in immune thrombotic\\n      thrombocytopenic purpura.\\nLID - bloodadvances.2022008028 [pii]\\nLID - 10.1182/bloodadvances.2022008028 [doi]\\nAB  - Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy\\n      caused by anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies. Caplacizumab is approved for adults with an\\n      acute episode of iTTP in conjunction with PEX and immunosuppression. The\\n      objective of this study is to analyze and compare the safety and efficacy of\\n      caplacizumab versus the standard of care and assess the effect of the concomitant\\n      use of rituximab. A retrospective study from the Spanish TTP Registry of patients\\n      treated with caplacizumab vs those who did not receive it was conducted. A total \\n      of 155 iTTP patients (77 caplacizumab, 78 no caplacizumab) were included.\\n      Patients initially treated with caplacizumab had fewer exacerbations (4.5% vs\\n      20.5% p<0.05) and less refractoriness (4.5% vs 14.1% p<0.05) than those that were\\n      not treated. Time to clinical response was shorter when caplacizumab was used as \\n      initial treatment vs caplacizumab used after refractoriness or exacerbation. The \\n      multivariate analysis showed that its use in the first 3 days after plasma\\n      exchange (PEX) was associated with a lower number of PEX (OR 7.5, CI 2.3-12.7;\\n      p<0.05) and days of hospitalization (OR 11.2, CI 5.6-16.9; p<0.001) compared to\\n      standard therapy. There was no difference in time to clinical remission in\\n      patients treated with caplacizumab compared to the use of rituximab. No severe\\n      adverse event was described in the caplacizumab group. In summary, caplacizumab\\n      reduced exacerbations and refractoriness compared to standard of care regimens.\\n      When administered within the first 3 days after PEX it also provided a faster\\n      clinical response, reducing hospitalization time and the need for PEX.\\nCI  -

10.1111/lam.13799 [doi]\\nAB  - One of the main drawbacks of chlorine disinfectants is the emergence of chlorine \\n      adapted (CA) or resistant microbial cells. This research aimed to investigate the\\n      effect of chlorine adaptation on resistance of Salmonella enterica upon\\n      atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) application at different voltages (6, 8, and 11 kV)\\n      and times (5, 10, and 15 min). Due to higher conversion efficiency and reduced\\n      dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) power consumption, this method was used for\\n      cold plasma generation in this study. A higher lethality effect was observed from\\n      a higher voltage and longest times (11 kV-15 min) on CA S. enterica than non-CA\\n      (p<0.05). Still, it induced higher percentages of injured cells in CA (58.77%)\\n      than non-CA (0.61%) (p<0.05). The highest ACP effect on the inactivation of the\\n      indigenous natural flora of onion leaves was observed at the lowest voltage\\n      (p<0.05). More than 3 log CFU/g reduction (p<0.05) was observed at 6 kV after 5\\n      and 10 min. ACP reduced CA and non-CA S. enterica cells on onion leaf surface to \\n      a lower extent than pure treated cells in broth media. Nevertheless similar to\\n      broth media, a high percentage of injury (61.03%) was induced on CA cells at\\n      higher voltage (11 kV-10 min) compared to non-CA (2.15%) (p<0.05). Biofilm\\n      results revealed ACP application (6 kV-5 min) reduced average ODs in CA and\\n      non-CA cells (p<0.05). Chlorine adaptation and ACP treatment influenced the\\n      antibiotic resistance pattern according to applied voltage, time, and antibiotic \\n      type. The finding showed despite highest lethality of high voltages and long\\n      times (11 kV-15 min), given the high percentages of injured cells, lower voltages\\n      may offer acceptable inactivation of pathogenic bacteria with lower injury\\n      induction. In conclusion, ACP has the potential ability to eliminate CA cells of \\n      S. enterica, which is predominant in fresh-cut vegetable outbreaks.\\nCI  - This article is protected by copyright.

ANIMALS: 56 fresh lungs were obtained from already euthanized adult\\n      dogs collected from different locations in Trinidad at the Trinidad and Tobago\\n      Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. PROCEDURES: Lung specimens were\\n      examined grossly and tissue samples were taken for routine histologic\\n      examination. RESULTS: Histological examination showed that 51.8% of the dogs had \\n      evidence of anthracosis. Dogs with anthracosis had greater median lesion scores\\n      compared to dogs without anthracosis (P = .022). There was no association between\\n      the presence of anthracosis and any other lesion in this study (P > .05).\\n      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There was evidence that dogs with anthracosis had a greater\\n      degree of nonspecific lung histologic lesions. Using the dog as a sentinel model \\n      for human exposure in Trinidad, our findings indicate that environmental air\\n      pollution may also have an effect on the respiratory health of the human\\n      population. It is important for the public to be aware of air pollution, and the \\n      government of Trinidad and Tobago should develop an intervention protocol along\\n      with veterinary and human medical epidemiologists to reduce air pollution in the \\n      country.\\nFAU - Mohamed, Reda A\\nAU  - Mohamed RA\\nFAU - Georges, Karla\\nAU  - Georges K\\nFAU - Rajh, Stacy\\nAU  - Rajh S\\nFAU - Suepaul, Rod B\\nAU  - Suepaul RB\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220809\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Am J Vet Res\\nJT  - American journal of veterinary research\\nJID - 0375011\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:53\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:53 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.2460/ajvr.22.05.0077 [doi]\\nAID - ajvr.22.05.0077 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Am J Vet Res. 2022 Aug 9;83(10). pii: ajvr.22.05.0077. doi:\\n      10.2460/ajvr.22.05.0077.\\n\\nPMID- 35930623\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1540-8167 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1045-3873 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Sex differences and adherence of patients treated with wearable\\n      cardioverter-defibrillator: insights from an international multicenter register.\\nLID - 10.1111/jce.15648 [doi]\\nAB  - AIMS: Treatment with the wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) may protect\\n      against sudden cardiac death (SCD) as a bridging therapy until a\\n      cardioverter-defibrillator may be implanted. We analyzed in a multicenter setting\\n      a consecutive patient cohort wearing WCD to explore sex differences. METHODS AND \\n      RESULTS: We analyzed 708 consecutive patients, 579 (81.8%) from whom were males\\n      and 129 (18.2%) females (age, 60.5+/-14 vs. 61.6+/-17 years old; p=0.44). While\\n      the rate of ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) as a cause of prescription of WCD was\\n      significantly higher in males as compared to females (42.7% vs. 26.4%; p=0.001), \\n      females received it more frequently due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM)\\n      (55.8% vs. 42.7%); p=0.009). The wear time of WCD was equivalent in both groups\\n      (21.1+/-4.3 hours/days in males vs. 21.5+/-4.4 hours/days in females; p=0.27; and\\n      62.6+/-44.3 days in males vs. 56.5+/-39 days in females; p=0.15). Mortality was\\n      comparable in both groups at 2-year-follow-up (6.8% in males vs. 9.7% in females;\\n      p=0.55). Appropriate WCD shocks and the incidence of ICD implantations were\\n      similar in both groups (2.4% in males vs. 3.9% in females; p=0.07) (35.1% in\\n      males vs. 31.8% in females; p=0.37), respectively. In age tertile analysis,\\n      compliance was observed more in 73-91 years old group as compared to 14-51 years \\n      old group (87.8% vs. 68.3%; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Compliance for wearing WCD was \\n      excellent regardless of sex. Furthermore, mortality and the incidence of ICD\\n      implantations were comparable in both sexes. Appropriate WCD shocks were similar \\n      in both sexes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\\nCI  - This article is protected by copyright.

Yet to date, whether such systems can become topological Ising\\n      superconductors remains to be materialized. Here we show that monolayered NbSe2\\n      can be converted into Ising superconductors with nontrivial band topology via\\n      physical or chemical pressuring. Using first-principles calculations, we first\\n      demonstrate that a hydrostatic pressure higher than 2.5 GPa can induce a p-d band\\n      inversion, rendering nontrivial band topology to NbSe2. We then illustrate that\\n      Te-doping can function as chemical pressuring in inducing nontrivial topology in \\n      NbSe2-xTex with x >/= 0.8, due to a larger atomic radius and stronger spin-orbit \\n      coupling of Te. We also evaluate the upper critical fields within both\\n      approaches, confirming the enhanced Ising superconductivity nature, as\\n      experimentally observed. Our findings may prove to be instrumental in material\\n      realization of topological Ising superconductivity in two-dimensional systems.\\nFAU - Li, Leiqiang\\nAU  - Li L\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-1754-1466\\nAD  - International Center for Quantum Design of Functional Materials (ICQD), and CAS\\n      Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of\\n      Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Shunhong\\nAU  - Zhang S\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2120-4574\\nAD  - International Center for Quantum Design of Functional Materials (ICQD), and CAS\\n      Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of\\n      Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.\\nFAU - Hu, Guojing\\nAU  - Hu G\\nAD  - Department of Materials Science & Engineering, CAS Key Lab of Materials for\\n      Energy Conversion, Anhui Laboratory of Advanced Photon Science and Technology,\\n      University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.\\nFAU - Guo, Linhai\\nAU  - Guo L\\nAD  - International Center for Quantum Design of Functional Materials (ICQD), and CAS\\n      Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of\\n      Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.\\nFAU - Wei, Tong\\nAU  - Wei T\\nAD  - International Center for Quantum Design of Functional Materials (ICQD), and CAS\\n      Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of\\n      Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.\\nFAU - Qin, Wei\\nAU  - Qin W\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-1035-1130\\nAD  - Department of Physics, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712,\\n      United States.\\nFAU - Xiang, Bin\\nAU  - Xiang B\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8254-8640\\nAD  - Department of Materials Science & Engineering, CAS Key Lab of Materials for\\n      Energy Conversion, Anhui Laboratory of Advanced Photon Science and Technology,\\n      University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.\\nAD  - Hefei National Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei\\n      230088, China.\\nFAU - Zeng, Changgan\\nAU  - Zeng C\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8630-845X\\nAD  - International Center for Quantum Design of Functional Materials (ICQD), and CAS\\n      Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of\\n      Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.\\nAD  - Hefei National Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei\\n      230088, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Zhenyu\\nAU  - Zhang Z\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5844-3558\\nAD  - International Center for Quantum Design of Functional Materials (ICQD), and CAS\\n      Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of\\n      Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.\\nAD  - Hefei National Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei\\n      230088, China.\\nFAU - Cui, Ping\\nAU  - Cui P\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3196-2563\\nAD  - International Center for Quantum Design of Functional Materials (ICQD), and CAS\\n      Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of\\n      Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.\\nAD  - Hefei National Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei\\n      230088, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Nano Lett\\nJT  - Nano letters\\nJID - 101088070\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Ising superconductivity\\nOT  - first-principles calculations\\nOT  - nontrivial topology\\nOT  - pressuring\\nOT  - transition metal dichalcogenides\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:52\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:52 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c02422 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Nano Lett. 2022 Aug 5. doi: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c02422.\\n\\nPMID- 35930617\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1540-8167 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1045-3873 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Impact of atrioventricular junction ablation and CRT-D on long-term mortality in \\n      patients with left ventricular dysfunction, permanent, refractory atrial\\n      fibrillation and narrow QRS: results of a propensity matched analysis.\\nLID - 10.1111/jce.15645 [doi]\\nAB  - INTRODUCTION: In patients with symptomatic permanent atrial fibrillation (PEAF)\\n      and narrow QRS, atrio-ventricular junction ablation (AVJA) plus cardiac\\n      resynchronization therapy (CRT) is superior to medical therapy in reducing heart \\n      failure (HF) hospitalization and all-cause mortality.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective,\\n      multicentre, observational study, all-cause mortality in a group of consecutive\\n      patients undergoing AVJA and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)\\n      combined with CRT implantation for HFrEF, narrow QRS, and PEAF with uncontrolled \\n      ventricular rate was compared with that of a contemporary cohort of patients in\\n      SR undergoing ICD implantation (not combined with CRT) for HFrEF and narrow QRS. \\n      Individual 1:1 propensity matching of baseline characteristics was performed. A\\n      total of 824 patients were enrolled. Propensity matching yielded 107 matched\\n      pairs. After a median follow-up of 52 months, all-cause mortality was similar in \\n      patients treated with AVJA plus CRT and in the control group (p=0.434). In AVJA\\n      plus CRT patients, mortality was significantly lower than in control group\\n      patients with a history of paroxysmal/persistent AF (n=45, p=0.020), and similar \\n      to that of patients without a history of AF (n=62, p=0.459). CONCLUSIONS: After\\n      adjustment for patient characteristics, the long-term prognosis of patients with \\n      HFrEF, narrow QRS and PEAF who underwent AVJA plus CRT was similar to that of a\\n      population of patients in SR with similar characteristics.

Ionic content\\n      clearly covaries with the distribution of plant communities. Previous studies on \\n      salt-based ions in soils focused primarily on ion migration and its relationships\\n      with vegetation growth. Few studies have sought to characterize larger scale\\n      spatial distribution of salt-based ions or correlation with climatic and plant\\n      community characteristics. This study used ion chromatography to analyze the\\n      salt-based ion content (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+) of surface soils from the\\n      Hunshandake sandy lands. Statistical methods were used interpret spatial\\n      variation. Results showed that the average content of salt-based ions in\\n      Hunshandake sandy land was 86.57 mg/kg. Average values ranked as Ca2+ > Na+ > K+ \\n      > Mg2+ but concentrations also exhibited uneven spatial distributions. Horizontal\\n      spatial variation in Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ ions showed these ions gradually decrease\\n      from northwest to southeast. Potassium ions (K+) showed no obvious spatial\\n      variation trends. Ions varied significantly across different soil layers but\\n      their average concentrations ranked as K+>Na+>Ca2+>Mg2+ (from shallow to deep).\\n      The 20-30 cm soil layer contained the highest salt ion concentrations. Of the\\n      four base ions, only K+ ions appeared in surface samples. In terms of water\\n      soluble base ion available salt-based ions, Ca2+ occurred in the highest\\n      concentrations along the north and west side of the study area. K+ ions occurred \\n      in the highest concentrations along the south and east sides of the study area.\\n      Na+ concentrations did not show a consistent spatial pattern. Statistical\\n      analysis detected significant correlations of normalized ion concentration\\n      parameters (Ca2+/CECT, K+/CEC, effective water soluble base ion salt-based ions) \\n      and the total species number, average species number and total biomass of the\\n      plant communities (P <0.05). This study can help inform understanding of soil\\n      water transport in sandy areas and provide a reference for interpreting\\n      ecosystems in arid regions.\\nFAU - Li, Zhanhong\\nAU  - Li Z\\nAD  - College of Resources and Environment, Baotou Teachers\\' College, Baotou, China.\\nFAU - Xie, Yunhu\\nAU  - Xie Y\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3883-3417\\nAD  - College of Resources and Environment, Baotou Teachers\\' College, Baotou, China.\\nFAU - Ning, Xiaoli\\nAU  - Ning X\\nAD  - College of Resources and Environment, Baotou Teachers\\' College, Baotou, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Xuefeng\\nAU  - Zhang X\\nAD  - College of Resources and Environment, Baotou Teachers\\' College, Baotou, China.\\nFAU - Hai, Quansheng\\nAU  - Hai Q\\nAD  - College of Resources and Environment, Baotou Teachers\\' College, Baotou, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - PLoS One\\nJT  - PloS one\\nJID - 101285081\\nSB  - IM\\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:44\\nPHST- 2021/09/25 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/03 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:44 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271562 [doi]\\nAID - PONE-D-21-30980 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - PLoS One. 2022 Aug 5;17(8):e0271562. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0271562.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35930609\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Linking)\\nVI  - 17\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Identification of differentially expressed genes for Pseudomonas sp.

Cr(VI), the pathogenicity factor, is\\n      one of common environmental contaminants and widely known health hazards to\\n      living organisms. Therefore, it is urgent to control the polluted soil. Up to\\n      now, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of Cr response in\\n      Pseudomonas sp. Cr13. In this study, transcriptome and differentially expressed\\n      genes in Pseudomonas sp. Cr13 strain was characterized by a comparison between\\n      Cr(VI)-treated sample and control sample using transcriptome sequencing approach.\\n      In total, 2974 genes were annotated, including 1245 (1154 down-regulated genes\\n      and 91 up-regulated genes) differentially expressed genes (DEGs). All DEGs could \\n      be assigned to 29 pathways, of which pathways related to amino acid metabolism,\\n      carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism and signal transduction mechanism were\\n      significantly enriched in Pseudomonas sp. Cr13. A possible mechanism for Cr\\n      toxicity response might be an active efflux which utilized a heavy metal\\n      translocating P-type ATPase to lower the intracellular Cr concentration. The\\n      down-regulated genes related to the antioxidant defense system had a key role in \\n      Cr reduction, such as SodA, Gst, osmC, BtuE, KatE, csdA and AhpC. The proteins\\n      that were visibly up-regulated, were likely to involve in alleviating Cr(VI)\\n      stress, and the significantly down-regulated genes such as MarR, Lrp, FhlA, GntR,\\n      HrcA, LysR family genes, were likely to reduce Cr(VI) induced oxidative stress.\\n      In addition, real-time quantitative PCR was used to analyze the expression\\n      patterns of some Cr responsive genes. This study reported the first\\n      identification of Cr responsive genes, and inferred the underlying regulatory\\n      mechanisms of response to Cr(VI) stress in Pseudomonas sp.

Here \\n      we demonstrate that IAV disseminates preferentially into the perivascular adipose\\n      tissue (PVAT) of the aorta in mice. IAV mRNA levels in the PVAT increased at 1-3 \\n      days post infection (d.p.i) with the levels being ~4-8 fold higher compared with \\n      the vessel wall. IAV infection also increased Ly6Clow patrolling monocytes and\\n      Ly6Chigh pro-inflammatory monocytes in the vessel wall at 3 d.p.i., which was\\n      then followed by a greater homing of these monocytes into the PVAT at 6 d.p.i.\\n      The vascular immune phenotype was characteristic of a \"vascular storm\"- like\\n      response, with increases in neutrophils, pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative\\n      stress markers in the PVAT and arterial wall, which was associated with an\\n      impairment in endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. IAV also\\n      triggered a PVAT compartmentalised elevation in CD4+ and CD8+ activated T cells. \\n      In conclusion, the PVAT of the aorta is a niche that supports IAV dissemination\\n      and a site for perpetuating a profound innate inflammatory and adaptive T cell\\n      response. The manifestation of this inflammatory response in the PVAT following\\n      IAV infection may be central to the genesis of cardiovascular complications\\n      arising during pregnancy.\\nFAU - Oseghale, Osezua\\nAU  -

Data were combined with random effects models.\\n      Between study heterogeneity (Cochran\\'s Q statistic) and the extent of study\\n      effects variability [I2 with 95% confidence interval (CI)] were estimated.\\n      Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of population, intervention, and study\\n      characteristics. We also evaluated the potential for publication bias. RESULTS:\\n      Among the 1,508 high-risk women who were analyzed in 9 RCTs, 374 (24.8%) [160\\n      (21.4%) in intervention, and 214 (28.1%) in control group] developed GDM. Women\\n      who received exercise intervention during pregnancy were less likely to develop\\n      GDM compared to those who followed the standard prenatal care (OR 0.70, 95%CI\\n      0.52, 0.93; P-value 0.02) [Q 10.08, P-value 0.26; I2 21% (95%CI 0, 62%]. Studies \\n      with low attrition bias also showed a similar result (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.51, 0.97; \\n      P-value 0.03). A protective effect was also supported when analysis was limited\\n      to studies including women with low education level (OR 0.55; 95%CI 0.40, 0.74;\\n      P-value 0.0001); studies with exercise intervention duration more than 20 weeks\\n      (OR 0.54; 95%CI 0.40, 0.74; P-value 0.0007); and studies with a motivation\\n      component in the intervention (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.50, 0.96; P-value 0.03). We could\\n      not exclude large variability in study effects because the upper limit of I2\\n      confidence interval was higher than 50% for all analyses.

Methods: A total of 108\\n      patients who diagnosed with PPLs by chest CT examination were prospectively\\n      collected and randomly divided into ROSE group (n = 56) and No-ROSE group (n =\\n      52). Both groups received CT-PLB and pathological examination. The smear\\n      submitted for ROSE was stained using Diff Quik dye. The accuracy, sensitivity,\\n      specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV),\\n      number of punctures, puncture time and incidence of complications were compared\\n      between the two groups. Results: The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and\\n      NPV of the ROSE group were 89.29%, 87.50%, 91.67%, 93.33%, and 84.62%,\\n      respectively. The number of punctures in the ROSE group was significantly lower\\n      than that in the No-ROSE group (P < .05). The incidence of pneumothorax and\\n      hemoptysis in the ROSE group were lower than those in the No-ROSE group, but\\n      there was no statistical difference between the two groups (P > .05).

The study intends to determine the factors \\n      of child undernutrition using a single composite index of anthropometric failure \\n      (CIAF) among the Bengali population. METHODS: Unit level data on 14055 under 5\\n      children were extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18\\n      (BDHS) and the 4th National Family Health Survey of India (NFHS-4). To understand\\n      child undernutrition and generate CIAF, data on height-for-age (stunting),\\n      weight-for-height (wasting), and weight-for-age (underweight) were used by WHO\\n      guidelines. These three undernutrition indicators were combined into a single\\n      undernutrition indicator called anthropometric failure (anth-failure) using the\\n      CIAF concept. Explanatory factors of anth-failure included data on maternal\\n      health, socio-demographic and birth-related variables. Differences of frequency\\n      were determined by Z-proportional and Chi-square tests; predictors of\\n      anth-failure were determined by binary logistic regression. Cut off point of\\n      p-value was taken as 0.05 to test the significance. RESULTS: Inter-country\\n      disparities were revealed, about half of Bengali children in India and two-fifths\\n      in Bangladesh being prone to anth-failure. Stunting and underweight were more\\n      prevalent in both countries than wasting. Maternal undernutrition, lack of\\n      maternal education, and poor wealth index were common factors of anth-failure for\\n      both countries. Children in Bangladesh developed anth-failure after the end of\\n      breastfeeding period, indicating a lack of nutritious food. Lack of antenatal\\n      care was another significant factor in Bangladesh. In India, the first child\\n      suffered from anth-failure due to lack of maternal education. CONCLUSIONS: This\\n      study provides a better understanding of multifactorial impact on child\\n      undernutrition. It is proposed that the emphasis should be on initiatives that\\n      improve maternal education and nutrition, child food security, boost household\\n      wealth index, and enhance mothers\\' access to health care. The study strongly\\n      recommends that the governments of Bangladesh and India invest financially in\\n      preventing child malnutrition, which will contribute to achieving the first four \\n      SDGs.\\nFAU - Kundu, Ramendra Nath\\nAU  - Kundu RN\\nAD  - Department of Anthropology, West Bengal State University, Kolkata, West Bengal,\\n      India.\\nFAU - Hossain, Md Golam\\nAU  - Hossain MG\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3822-5489\\nAD  - Department of Statistics, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.\\nFAU - Haque, Md Ahshanul\\nAU  - Haque MA\\nAD  - Nutrition and Clinical Services Division, icddr,b, Dhaka, Bangladesh.\\nFAU - Biswas, Subir\\nAU  - Biswas S\\nAD  - Department of Anthropology, West Bengal State University, Kolkata, West Bengal,\\n      India.\\nFAU - Huq, Md Monimul\\nAU  - Huq MM\\nAD  - Department of Statistics, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.\\nFAU - Pasa, Md Kamal\\nAU  - Pasa MK\\nAD  - Department of Anthropology, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.\\nFAU - Sabiruzzaman, Md\\nAU  - Sabiruzzaman M\\nAD  - Department of Statistics, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.\\nFAU - Bharati, Premananda\\nAU  - Bharati P\\nAD  - Biological Anthropology Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, West Bengal,\\n      India.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - PLoS One\\nJT  - PloS one\\nJID - 101285081\\nSB  - IM\\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:43\\nPHST- 2021/12/31 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/23 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:43 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272634 [doi]\\nAID - PONE-D-21-41052 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - PLoS One. 2022 Aug 5;17(8):e0272634. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0272634.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35930582\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Linking)\\nVI  - 17\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Comparing the effect of childbirth preparation courses delivered both in-person\\n      and via social media on pregnancy experience, fear of childbirth, birth\\n      preference and mode of birth in pregnant Iranian women: A quasi-experimental\\n      study.\\nPG  - e0272613\\nLID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272613 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Rates of cesarean section in Iran are unnecessarily high\\n      largely due to fear of childbirth (FOC), yet this may be reduced through\\n      education. Iranian women are keen to obtain information about pregnancy and birth\\n      online though sources may not be reliable. Consequently, the present study aimed \\n      to compare the effect of childbirth preparation courses delivered both online via\\n      the social media platform \\'Telegram\\' and in-person on pregnancy experience, FOC, \\n      birth preference, and mode of birth. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study\\n      included 165 primiparous pregnant women referred to the prenatal clinic in\\n      Tehran, Iran. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants, who were\\n      subsequently divided into three groups; (A) social media-based educational\\n      intervention (n = 53); (B) in-person educational intervention (n = 52), and (C) a\\n      control group who received no prenatal education (n = 50). During the 18th and\\n      20th weeks of pregnancy, demographic questions along with the pregnancy\\n      experience scale (PES), and version A of the Wijma delivery expectancy/experience\\n      questionnaire (WDEQA) were completed. In the 36th and 38th weeks of pregnancy,\\n      the PES and WDEQA questionnaires, as well as birth preference form were further\\n      completed. Mode of birth was recorded in the first few days of postpartum. The\\n      Fisher\\'s exact test, along with ANOVA and Chi-square tests were used to determine\\n      associations between variables. A paired t-test was used to examine within-group \\n      comparisons. The Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used to investigate the\\n      intervening effect of economic status. RESULTS: Post intervention, the mean score\\n      of pregnancy experience and FOC did not differ significantly between the three\\n      groups. Also, 86.8% of participants in group A, 90.4% of participants in group B,\\n      and 62% of participants in the control group preferred to give birth vaginally,\\n      which was statistically significant (p = 0.001). Moreover, 66% of participants in\\n      group A, 61.5% of participants in group B, and 50% of participants in the control\\n      group ultimately gave birth vaginally. None of the participants in group A\\n      underwent an elective cesarean section, while this rate was 7.7% and 24% for\\n      groups B and control, respectively (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Despite the\\n      non-significant differences identified between the three groups in terms of\\n      pregnancy experience and FOC, prenatal education delivered via social media may\\n      be usefully offered to Iranian women keen to receive education flexibly online.\\n      TRIAL REGISTRATION: Name of the Registry: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials.\\n      Trial registration number: IRCT20180427039436N2.

Avoidance of needed\\n      in-person care may contribute to an avoidable decline in patient health and an\\n      increase in mortality. While several systems and behavioral theories have been\\n      put forward to explain the decline, there is a lack of studies informed by\\n      patients\\' own experiences. The current study applied a socio-ecological model\\n      encompassing patient, environmental, and institutional-related variables to\\n      examine patient-reported factors associated with avoidance of in-person care.\\n      METHODS: Between October and December 2020, a total of 3840 persons responded to \\n      a nationwide online questionnaire that was administered using ResearchMatch and\\n      Facebook. Self-reported avoidance of in-person care among those who needed it was\\n      the main outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify\\n      factors associated with avoidance of needed care. FINDINGS: Out of a total of\\n      3372 respondents who reported that they needed in-person care during the early\\n      phase of the pandemic, 257 (7.6%) avoided it. Patient-related variables\\n      associated with avoiding needed care included younger age (odds ratio (OR), 1.46,\\n      95% CI 1.11 to 1.94, p<0.01; <45 y/o vs 45+), inability to afford care (OR =\\n      1.65, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.34, p<0.01), and greater COVID-related stress (OR = 1.36, \\n      CI 1.01 to 1.83, p<0.05). More frequent discussions about COVID with family and\\n      friends was the only significant environment-related avoidance of care variable\\n      (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.01-1.91, p < .05). Institution-related care avoidance\\n      variables included a negative patient healthcare experience rating (OR 1.83, 95% \\n      CI 1.38 to 2.42, p<0.001), poor awareness of the institution\\'s safety protocol\\n      (OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.51, p<0.01), and low ratings of the institution\\'s\\n      effectiveness in communicating their safety protocol (OR = 3.45, 95% CI 1.94 to\\n      6.12, p<0.001). The final model predicted 11.9% of the variance in care\\n      avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that care avoidance of in-person\\n      care during the initial phase of the pandemic was influenced by a patient\\'s\\n      demographics as well as environmental and healthcare institutional factors.\\n      Patients\\' previous experiences and their awareness of healthcare systems\\' safety \\n      protocols are important factors in care avoidance.\\nFAU - Arnetz, Bengt B\\nAU  - Arnetz BB\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7173-4333\\nAD  - Department of Family Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State\\n      University, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.\\nFAU - Goetz, Courtney\\nAU  - Goetz C\\nAD  - Department of Family Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State\\n      University, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.\\nFAU - vanSchagen, John\\nAU  - vanSchagen J\\nAD  - Department of Family Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State\\n      University, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.\\nAD  - Trinity Health Saint Mary\\'s, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.\\nFAU - Baer, William\\nAU  - Baer W\\nAD  - Trinity Health Saint Mary\\'s, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.\\nFAU - Smith, Stacy\\nAU  - Smith S\\nAD  - Trinity Health Saint Mary\\'s, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.\\nFAU - Arnetz, Judith E\\nAU  - Arnetz JE\\nAD  - Department of Family Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State\\n      University, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - PLoS One\\nJT  - PloS one\\nJID - 101285081\\nSB  - IM\\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:42\\nPHST- 2021/11/16 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/22 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:42 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272609 [doi]\\nAID - PONE-D-21-35375 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - PLoS One. 2022 Aug 5;17(8):e0272609. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0272609.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35930578\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Linking)\\nVI  - 17\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Ocular biometric changes following unilateral cataract surgery in children.\\nPG  - e0272369\\nLID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272369 [doi]\\nAB  - PURPOSE: To analyze ocular biometric changes following unilateral cataract\\n      surgery in children. METHODS: A total of 57 children aged under 13 years who\\n      underwent unilateral cataract surgery were analyzed. Groups were classified\\n      according to their age at surgery: group I (age <3), II (3</= age <6), III (6</= \\n      age <9), and IV (age >/=9). The myopic shift, axial growth, and corneal curvature\\n      changes were compared between the pseudophakic eyes and the fellow phakic eyes.\\n      RESULTS: During 7.81 +/- 4.39 years, the overall myopic shift (D) and the rate of\\n      myopic shift (D/year) were significantly higher at -3.25 +/- 3.21 D and -0.45 +/-\\n      0.44 D/year in the pseudophakic eyes than -1.78 +/- 2.10 D and -0.22 +/- 0.29\\n      D/year in the fellow phakic eyes (P = 0.01, 0.004). Group I (-1.14 +/- 0.66 vs\\n      -0.02 +/- 0.45 D/year) and group II (-0.63 +/- 0.37 vs -0.31 +/- 0.29 D/year)\\n      showed significantly higher rate of myopic shift in the pseudophakic eyes than in\\n      the phakic eyes. The rate of myopic shift in the pseudophakic eyes decreased in\\n      the older age groups (P = 0.001). There was no significant between-eye difference\\n      in the changes in axial length and keratometric values postoperatively.\\n      CONCLUSION: Following unilateral cataract surgery, a significant postoperative\\n      myopic shift was noticed in the pseudophakic eyes compared to the fellow phakic\\n      eyes in groups under 6 years old. Postoperative myopic shift and the resultant\\n      anisometropia should be considered when selecting the optimal power of IOL in\\n      young children requiring unilateral cataract surgery.\\nFAU - Park, Yooyeon\\nAU  - Park Y\\nAD  - Department of Ophthalmology, College of Medicine, Dankook University, Cheonan,\\n      Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Yum, Hae Ri\\nAU  - Yum HR\\nAD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Eunpyeong St. Mary\\'s Hospital, College of Medicine, \\n      The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Shin, Sun Young\\nAU  - Shin SY\\nAD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul St. Mary\\'s Hospital, College of Medicine, The \\n      Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Park, Shin Hae\\nAU  - Park SH\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5098-1340\\nAD  - Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul St. Mary\\'s Hospital, College of Medicine, The \\n      Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - PLoS One\\nJT  - PloS one\\nJID - 101285081\\nSB  - IM\\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:42\\nPHST- 2022/03/23 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/18 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:42 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272369 [doi]\\nAID - PONE-D-22-08693 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - PLoS One. 2022 Aug 5;17(8):e0272369. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0272369.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35930575\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Linking)\\nVI  - 17\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Clinical performance of the Roche Cobas 4800 HPV test for primary cervical cancer\\n      screening in a Chinese population.\\nPG  - e0272721\\nLID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272721 [doi]\\nAB  - High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing has become an increasing\\n      important strategy in primary cervical cancer screening in recent years. It\\n      warrants the evaluation of molecular-based HPV tests for accuracy and efficacy of\\n      screening. The performance of Roche Cobas 4800 HPV test was validated and\\n      compared with Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) high-risk HPV DNA test for primary\\n      screening in a large Chinese screening cohort. Of 6345 women screened, overall\\n      agreement between Cobas and HC2 was 92.23% (95% CI: 91.57-92.89). The inter-assay\\n      agreement was correlated with the severity of underlying biology, with an\\n      increasing concordance found in samples with more severe abnormalities. Most of\\n      the discordant samples had the test signal strength closer to the test limits of \\n      the detection than concordant samples, reflecting a low viral load and infection \\n      of a cluster of low-risk HPV in these samples. The Cobas test demonstrated\\n      significantly higher specificity in identifying CIN2+/CIN3+ cases than HC2 test\\n      (66.46% vs 43.67% and 65.42% vs 42.86%, p<0.001), with comparable sensitivity in \\n      clinical evaluation. Increased specificity of Cobas test would accent women\\n      having the highest risk of developing CIN2+, with the potential to reduce\\n      unnecessary colposcopy referral in a screening population.\\nFAU - Liu, Stephanie S\\nAU  - Liu SS\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4434-7770\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The\\n      University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.\\nFAU - Chan, Karen K L\\nAU  - Chan KKL\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The\\n      University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.\\nFAU - Wei, Tina N\\nAU  - Wei TN\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The\\n      University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.\\nFAU - Tse, Ka Yu\\nAU  - Tse KY\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The\\n      University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.\\nFAU - Ngu, Siew F\\nAU  - Ngu SF\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The\\n      University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.\\nFAU - Chu, Mandy M Y\\nAU  - Chu MMY\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The\\n      University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.\\nFAU - Lau, Lesley S K\\nAU  - Lau LSK\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The\\n      University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.\\nFAU - Cheung, Annie N Y\\nAU  - Cheung ANY\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong \\n      Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.\\nFAU - Ngan, Hextan Y S\\nAU  - Ngan HYS\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The\\n      University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - PLoS One\\nJT  - PloS one\\nJID - 101285081\\nSB  - IM\\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:35\\nPHST- 2021/10/13 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/20 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:35 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272721 [doi]\\nAID - PONE-D-21-31967 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - PLoS One. 2022 Aug 5;17(8):e0272721. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0272721.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35930572\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Linking)\\nVI  - 17\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Adherence to Covid-19 mitigation measures and its associated factors among health\\n      care workers at referral hospitals in Amhara regional state of Ethiopia.\\nPG  - e0272570\\nLID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272570 [doi]\\nAB  - INTRODUCTION: With fragile health care systems, sub-Saharan Africa countries like\\n      Ethiopia are facing a complex epidemic, and become difficult to control the noble\\n      coronavirus. The use of COVID-19 preventive measures is strongly recommended.\\n      This study aimed to assess the adherence of COVID-19 mitigation measures and\\n      associated factors among health care workers. METHODS: A facility-based\\n      cross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers at referral\\n      hospitals in the Amhara regional state of Ethiopia from May 15 to June 10; 2021. \\n      It was a web-based study using an online questionnaire. STATA 14.2 was used for\\n      data analysis. Variables with a p-value<0.05 at 95% confidence level in\\n      multivariable analysis were declared as statistically significant using binary\\n      logistic regression. RESULT: Adherence to COVID-19 mitigation measures was 50.24%\\n      in the current study. The odd of adherence of participants with a monthly income \\n      of >/=12801birr was 15% whereas the odds of adherence of participants who\\n      hesitate to take the COVID 19 vaccine were 10% as compared to those who don\\'t\\n      hesitate. Participants who had undergone COVID-19 tests adhered 6.64 times more\\n      than their counterparts. Those who believe adequate measurements are taken by the\\n      government adhered 4.6 times more than those who believe not adequate.\\n      Participants who believe as no risk of severe disease adhered 16% compared to\\n      those with fear of severe disease. Presence of households aged >60years adhered\\n      about 7.9 times more than with no households aged>60. Participants suspected of\\n      COVID-19 diagnosis adhered 5.7 times more than those not suspected. CONCLUSION:\\n      In this study, a significant proportion of healthcare workers did not adhere to\\n      COVID-19 mitigation measures. Hence, giving special attention to healthcare\\n      workers with a monthly income of >/=12801 birr, being hesitant towards COVID-19\\n      vaccine, being aged 26-30, and perceiving no risk of developing a severe\\n      infection is crucial to reduce non-adherence.\\nFAU - Aemro, Agazhe\\nAU  - Aemro A\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0187-5920\\nAD  - Department of Medical Nursing, College of Medicine and Health Sciences,\\n      University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.\\nFAU - Fentie, Beletech\\nAU  - Fentie B\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3475-9827\\nAD  - Department Pediatrics and Child Health Nursing, College of Medicine and Health\\n      Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.\\nFAU - Wassie, Mulugeta\\nAU  - Wassie M\\nAD  - Department of Medical Nursing, College of Medicine and Health Sciences,\\n      University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - PLoS One\\nJT  - PloS one\\nJID - 101285081\\nSB  - IM\\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:34\\nPHST- 2021/12/02 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/21 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:34 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272570 [doi]\\nAID - PONE-D-21-38230 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - PLoS One. 2022 Aug 5;17(8):e0272570. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0272570.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35930558\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Linking)\\nVI  - 17\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Effect of Zanthoxylum bungeanum essential oil on rumen enzyme activity,\\n      microbiome, and metabolites in lambs.\\nPG  - e0272310\\nLID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272310 [doi]\\nAB  - Antibiotics were once used in animal production to improve productivity and\\n      resistance to pathogenic microbiota.

Plant essential oils (EOs) as a natural feed\\n      additive can maintain microbiota homeostasis and improve animal performance.\\n      However, its specific mechanism of action needs to be further investigated.\\n      Therefore, we added different doses of essential oil of Zanthoxylum bungeanum\\n      (EOZB) to the diets of Small Tail Han Sheep hybrid male lambs (STH lambs) to\\n      evaluate the effect of EOZB on rumen enzyme activity, rumen microbiology, and its\\n      metabolites in STH lambs. Twenty STH lambs were randomly divided into four groups\\n      (n = 5/group) and provided with the same diet.

We tested whether messages designed to address these\\n      beliefs and concerns might promote intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine. METHOD: \\n      We conducted an online survey fielded between March 8-23, 2021 with US Veteran (n\\n      = 688) and non-Veteran (n = 387) respondents.

Herein, by selenation of polyoxometalate in electrospinning\\n      fiber, a novel MoO2/MoSe2 heterostructure embedded in one-dimensional (1D)\\n      N,P-doped carbon nanofiber (MoO2/MoSe2@NPC) is rationally constructed to show\\n      distinct enhancement of rate performance and cycle life for sodium ion batteries \\n      (SIBs) and potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The 1D skeleton of MoO2/MoSe2@NPC\\n      decreases the diffusion pathway of Na(+)/K(+), and the doping of N/P heteroatoms \\n      in carbon fiber creates abundant active sites and provides good reachability for \\n      Na(+)/K(+) transportation. MoSe2 nanosheets grow in the bulk phase of MoO2 via in\\n      situ local phase transformation to achieve effective and firm heterointerfaces.\\n      Especially, the exposure extent of heterointerfaces can be controlled by\\n      treatment temperature during the preparation process, and the optimized\\n      heterointerfaces result in an ideal synergic effect between MoO2 and MoSe2. DFT\\n      calculations confirm that the internal electric field in the heterogeneous\\n      interface guides the electron transfer from MoO2 to MoSe2, combined with strong\\n      adsorption capacity toward sodium/potassium, facilitating ion/electron transfer\\n      kinetics. It is confirmed that the MoO2/MoSe2@NPC anode for SIBs delivers 382 mA \\n      h g(-1) under 0.1 A g(-1) upon 200 cycles; meanwhile, a reversible capacity of\\n      266 mA h g(-1) is maintained even under 2 A g(-1) after 2000 cycles. For PIBs, it\\n      can reach up to 216 mA h g(-1) in the 200th cycle and still retain 125 mA h g(-1)\\n      after 2000 cycles under 1 A g(-1). This study opens up a new interface\\n      manipulation strategy for the design of anode materials to boost fast Na(+)/K(+) \\n      storage kinetics.\\nFAU - Yu, Jian\\nAU  - Yu J\\nAD  - Collaborative Innovation Center of Metal Nanoclusters & Photo/Electro-Catalysis\\n      and Sensing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Jinan,\\n      250022 Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Cao, Yun-Dong\\nAU  - Cao YD\\nAD  - Collaborative Innovation Center of Metal Nanoclusters & Photo/Electro-Catalysis\\n      and Sensing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Jinan,\\n      250022 Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Ming-Liang\\nAU  - Wang ML\\nAD  - Collaborative Innovation Center of Metal Nanoclusters & Photo/Electro-Catalysis\\n      and Sensing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Jinan,\\n      250022 Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Fan, Lin-Lin\\nAU  - Fan LL\\nAD  - Collaborative Innovation Center of Metal Nanoclusters & Photo/Electro-Catalysis\\n      and Sensing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Jinan,\\n      250022 Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Sun, Wen-Guang\\nAU  - Sun WG\\nAD  - Collaborative Innovation Center of Metal Nanoclusters & Photo/Electro-Catalysis\\n      and Sensing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Jinan,\\n      250022 Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Qi, Bin\\nAU  - Qi B\\nAD  - Collaborative Innovation Center of Metal Nanoclusters & Photo/Electro-Catalysis\\n      and Sensing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Jinan,\\n      250022 Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Yu-Xi\\nAU  - Zhang YX\\nAD  - Collaborative Innovation Center of Metal Nanoclusters & Photo/Electro-Catalysis\\n      and Sensing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Jinan,\\n      250022 Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Dong, Xin-Yang\\nAU  - Dong XY\\nAD  - Collaborative Innovation Center of Metal Nanoclusters & Photo/Electro-Catalysis\\n      and Sensing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Jinan,\\n      250022 Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Gao, Guang-Gang\\nAU  - Gao GG\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-1157-6983\\nAD  - Collaborative Innovation Center of Metal Nanoclusters & Photo/Electro-Catalysis\\n      and Sensing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Jinan,\\n      250022 Jinan, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - ACS Appl Mater Interfaces\\nJT  - ACS applied materials & interfaces\\nJID - 101504991\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - MoO2/MoSe2 heterostructure\\nOT  - high-rate performance\\nOT  - polyoxometalates\\nOT  - selenation\\nOT  - sodium/potassium ion storage\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:33\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:33 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1021/acsami.2c08080 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - ACS Appl Mater Interfaces. 2022 Aug 5. doi: 10.1021/acsami.2c08080.\\n\\nPMID- 35930539\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Linking)\\nVI  - 17\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Survival and complications after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant\\n      chemotherapy for esophageal squamous cell cancer: A meta-analysis.\\nPG  - e0271242\\nLID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271242 [doi]\\nAB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the survival and complications of neoadjuvant\\n      chemoradiation (NCRT) versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) for esophageal\\n      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature\\n      search of the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, Wanfang\\n      Data, CBM, and VIP databases from inception to November 2021. Meta-analyses were \\n      performed using RevMan (version 5.3) and Stata version 15.0. RESULTS: A total of \\n      18 studies were included, which involved 3137 patients, The results of the\\n      metaanalysis showed that the pathological complete remission rate (odds ratio\\n      [OR] = 5.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.85-9.50, p<0.00001) and complete\\n      tumor resection rate (OR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.57-3.41, p<0.0001) in the NCRT group\\n      were significantly better than those in the NCT group. Our meta-analysis results \\n      showed that 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates (1-year overall survival [OS]: OR =\\n      1.51, 95% CI: 1.11-2.05, p = 0.009; 3-year OS: OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.36-2.21,\\n      p<0.0001; 5-year OS: OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.30-1.99, p<0.00001) in the NCRT group\\n      were significantly higher than those in the NCT group. NCRT can lead a\\n      significant survival benefit compared with NCT and there was no significant\\n      difference between the two neoadjuvant treatments in terms of postoperative\\n      complications.

The diagnosis of PA currently requires multiple complicated\\n      measures. The aims of this study were to identify easy-to-obtain clinical and\\n      biochemical predictors, and to create predictive model to facilitate the\\n      identification of a patient at high risk of having PA. MATERIALS AND METHODS:\\n      This 2-year retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care medical\\n      center. A total of 305 patients who had been tested for plasma aldosterone\\n      concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were identified. Patients\\n      with incomplete results of PAC and PRA and those who had an established diagnosis\\n      of Cushing\\'s syndrome or pheochromocytoma were excluded. Logistic regression\\n      analysis was used to identify significant predictors and to create predictive\\n      model of PA. RESULTS: PA was diagnosed in 128 of the patients (41.96%).\\n      Significant predictive factors for PA were age >60 years (OR 2.12, p = 0.045),\\n      female (OR 1.65, p<0.001), smoking (OR 2.79, p<0.001), coronary artery disease\\n      (OR 2.29, p<0.001), obstructive sleep apnea (OR 1.50, p = 0.017), systolic blood \\n      pressure >160 mmHg (OR 1.15, P<0.001), serum potassium <3 mEq/L (OR 3.72, p =\\n      0.030), fasting blood glucose >126 mg/dL (OR 0.48, p = 0.001) and estimated\\n      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (OR 1.79, p = 0.001).\\n      Predictive model was created with a total score ranged from 0 to 42. A score\\n      above 7.5 indicated a higher probability of having PA with a sensitivity of 72%\\n      and a specificity of 70%. The diagnostic performance of the predictive model\\n      based on area under the curve was 71%. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and biochemical \\n      predictive factors including predictive model identified in this study can be\\n      employed as an additional tool to help identify patients at risk of having PA and\\n      could help reduce the number of screening and confirmation tests required for PA.\\nFAU - Manosroi, Worapaka\\nAU  - Manosroi W\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3007-3951\\nAD  - Endocrine and Metabolism Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine,\\n      Chiang Mai University, Muang Chiang Mai, Chiang Mai, Thailand.\\nFAU - Tacharearnmuang, Natthanan\\nAU  - Tacharearnmuang N\\nAD  - Internal Medicine Department, Lee Hospital, Lamphun, Thailand.\\nFAU - Atthakomol, Pichitchai\\nAU  - Atthakomol P\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9737-4110\\nAD  - Orthopedics Department, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Muang Chiang \\n      Mai, Chiang Mai, Thailand.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - PLoS One\\nJT  - PloS one\\nJID - 101285081\\nSB  - IM\\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:33\\nPHST- 2021/09/08 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/12 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:33 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272049 [doi]\\nAID - PONE-D-21-29103 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - PLoS One. 2022 Aug 5;17(8):e0272049. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0272049.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35930528\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Linking)\\nVI  - 17\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Incidence and risk factors of COVID-19 associated pneumothorax.\\nPG  - e0271964\\nLID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271964 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumothorax has been increasingly observed among patients with\\n      coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, specifically in those patients who\\n      develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this study, we sought to\\n      determine the incidence and potential risk factors of pneumothorax in critically \\n      ill adults with COVID-19. METHOD: This retrospective cohort study included adult \\n      patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to one of the\\n      adult intensive care units of a tertiary, academic teaching hospital from May\\n      2020 through May 2021. RESULTS: Among 334 COVID-19 cases requiring ICU admission,\\n      the incidence of pneumothorax was 10% (33 patients). Patients who experienced\\n      pneumothorax more frequently required vasopressor support (28/33 [84%] vs.\\n      191/301 [63%] P = 0.04), were more likely to be proned (25/33 [75%] vs. 111/301\\n      [36%], P<0.001), and the presence of pneumothorax was associated with prolonged\\n      duration of mechanical ventilation; 21 (1-97) versus 7 (1-79) days, p<0.001 as\\n      well as prolonged hospital length of stay (29 [9-133] vs. 15 [1-90] days,\\n      P<0.001), but mortality was not significantly different between groups.\\n      Importantly, when we performed a Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) model of\\n      multivariate parameters, we found that administration of tocilizumab\\n      significantly increased the risk of developing pneumothorax (HR = 10.7; CI\\n      [3.6-32], P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Among 334 critically ill patients with COVID-19, \\n      the incidence of pneumothorax was 10%.

In Finland,\\n      Physician\\'s Databases are online portals aimed at professionals seeking medical\\n      information. As dosage errors may occur when prescribing medication to children, \\n      professionals\\' need for reliable medical information has increased in public\\n      health care centers and hospitals. Influenza continues to be a public health\\n      threat, with young children at risk of developing severe illness and easily\\n      transmitting the virus. Oseltamivir is used to treat children with influenza. The\\n      objective of this study was to compare searches for children\\'s oseltamivir and\\n      influenza diagnoses in primary and specialized care, and to determine if the\\n      searches could aid detection of influenza outbreaks. METHODS: We compared\\n      searches in Physician\\'s Databases for children\\'s oral suspension of oseltamivir\\n      (6 mg/mL) for influenza diagnoses of children under 7 years and laboratory\\n      findings of influenza A and B from the National Infectious Disease Register.\\n      Searches and diagnoses were assessed in primary and specialized care across\\n      Finland by season from 2012-2016. The Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) calculated\\n      seasonal starts and ends, and paired differences in the mean compared two\\n      indicators. Correlation was tested to compare seasons. RESULTS: We found that\\n      searches and diagnoses in primary and specialized care showed visually similar\\n      patterns annually. The MEM-calculated starting weeks in searches appeared mainly \\n      in the same week. Oseltamivir searches in primary care preceded diagnoses by -1.0\\n      weeks (95% CI: -3.0, -0.3; p = 0.132) with very high correlation (tau = 0.913).\\n      Specialized care oseltamivir searches and diagnoses correlated moderately (tau = \\n      0.667). CONCLUSION: Health care professionals\\' searches for children\\'s\\n      oseltamivir in online databases linked with the registers of children\\'s influenza\\n      diagnoses in primary and specialized care. Therefore, database searches should be\\n      considered as supplementary information in disease surveillance when detecting\\n      influenza epidemics.\\nFAU - Mukka, Milla\\nAU  - Mukka M\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6148-4158\\nAD  - University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\\nFAU - Pesala, Samuli\\nAU  - Pesala S\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6090-1367\\nAD  - University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\\nAD  - Epidemiological Operations Unit, City of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\\nFAU - Juutinen, Aapo\\nAU  - Juutinen A\\nAD  - Department of Health Security, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare,\\n      Helsinki, Finland.\\nFAU - Virtanen, Mikko J\\nAU  - Virtanen MJ\\nAD  - Department of Health Security, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare,\\n      Helsinki, Finland.\\nFAU - Mustonen, Pekka\\nAU  - Mustonen P\\nAD  - Duodecim Medical Publications Ltd, Helsinki, Finland.\\nFAU - Kaila, Minna\\nAU  - Kaila M\\nAD  - Clinicum, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\\nFAU - Helve, Otto\\nAU  - Helve O\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6254-3180\\nAD  - Department of Health Security, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare,\\n      Helsinki, Finland.\\nAD  - Children\\'s Hospital, Pediatric Research Center, University of Helsinki and\\n      Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - PLoS One\\nJT  - PloS one\\nJID - 101285081\\nSB  - IM\\nCOIS- MK has held various trustee positions in the Finnish Medical Society Duodecim\\n      since the late 1990s.

The present study\\n      aimed at evaluating immunological changes in patients with severe acute\\n      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia compared with the\\n      control group. METHOD: The present study was performed on 95 patients with\\n      COVID-19 (32 severe and 63 moderate cases) and 22 healthy controls. Relationship \\n      between immune cells, disease severity and lung involvement was assessed. Binary \\n      logistic regression and ROC curve tests were used for statistical analysis.\\n      RESULTS: A significant decrease was observed in CD20+ cell counts of the\\n      patients. To differentiate patients from healthy individuals, the cutoff point\\n      for the CD4+ cell count was 688 /muL, sensitivity 0.96, and specificity 0.84. An \\n      increase in CD4+ cells reduces the odds of severe disease (odds ratio = 0.82, P =\\n      0.047) and death (odds ratio = 0.74, P = 0.029). CD4+ cells play a pivotal role\\n      in the severity of lung involvement (P = 0.03). In addition to CD4+ cells, Fc\\n      gamma receptor III (FcgammaRIII) (CD16) also played a significant prognosis (odds\\n      ratio = 0.55, P = 0.047). In severe cases, C-reactive protein, Blood urea\\n      nitrogen, and Creatine phosphokinase levels, as well as neutrophil counts, were\\n      significantly higher than those of moderate ones whereas lymphocyte count in\\n      severe cases was lower than that of moderate ones. CONCLUSION: The number of\\n      total T-cells and B-cells in patients with COVID-19 was lower than that of\\n      controls; however, their NK cells increased. FcgammaRIII and CD4+ cells are of\\n      great importance due to their association with COVID-19 prognosis.\\nFAU - Alahyari, Sam\\nAU  - Alahyari S\\nAD  - Science and Research branch, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\\nAD  - Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran,\\n      Iran.\\nFAU - Rajaeinejad, Mohsen\\nAU  - Rajaeinejad M\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3146-1144\\nAD  - AJA Cancer Epidemiology Research and Treatment Center (AJA- CERTC), AJA\\n      University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\\nFAU - Jalaeikhoo, Hasan\\nAU  - Jalaeikhoo H\\nAD  - AJA Cancer Epidemiology Research and Treatment Center (AJA- CERTC), AJA\\n      University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\\nFAU - Chegini, Leila\\nAU  - Chegini L\\nAD  - Resident of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Aja University of Medical\\n      Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\\nFAU - Almasi Aghdam, Maryam\\nAU  - Almasi Aghdam M\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, \\n      Iran.\\nFAU - Asgari, Ali\\nAU  - Asgari A\\nAD  - Infectious Diseases Research Center, AJA University of Medical Science, Tehran,\\n      Iran.\\nFAU - Nasiri, Malihe\\nAU  - Nasiri M\\nAD  - Department of biostatics, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran,\\n      Iran.\\nFAU - Khoshdel, Alireza\\nAU  - Khoshdel A\\nAD  - Modern Epidemiology Research Center, Aja University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, \\n      Iran.\\nFAU - Faridfar, Ali\\nAU  - Faridfar A\\nAD  - AJA Cancer Epidemiology Research and Treatment Center (AJA- CERTC), AJA\\n      University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - PLoS One\\nJT  - PloS one\\nJID - 101285081\\nSB  - IM\\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:32\\nPHST- 2021/06/19 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/05/05 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:32 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268712 [doi]\\nAID - PONE-D-21-20178 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - PLoS One. 2022 Aug 5;17(8):e0268712. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0268712.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35930525\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1932-6203 (Linking)\\nVI  - 17\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Diagnostic accuracy of S-Detect in distinguishing benign and malignant thyroid\\n      nodules: A meta-analysis.\\nPG  - e0272149\\nLID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272149 [doi]\\nAB  - OBJECTIVES: In this meta-analysis study, the main objective was to determine the \\n      accuracy of S-detect in effectively distinguishing malignant thyroid nodules from\\n      benign thyroid nodules. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and\\n      CBM databases from inception to August 1, 2021. Meta-analysis was conducted using\\n      STATA version 14.0 and Meta-Disc version 1.4 softwares. We calculated summary\\n      statistics for sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), positive and negative\\n      likelihood ratio (LR+/LR-), diagnostic odds ratio(DOR), and receiver operating\\n      characteristic (SROC) curves. Cochran\\'s Q-statistic and I2 test were used to\\n      evaluate potential heterogeneity between studies. A sensitivity analysis was\\n      performed to evaluate the influence of single studies on the overall estimate. We\\n      also performed meta-regression analyses to investigate the potential sources of\\n      heterogeneity. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 17 studies meeting the\\n      requirements of the standard were used. The number of benign and malignant\\n      nodules analyzed and evaluated in this paper was 1595 and 1118 respectively. This\\n      paper mainly completes the required histological confirmation through s-detect.\\n      The pooled Sen and pooled Spe were 0.87 and 0.74, respectively, (95%CI =\\n      0.84-0.89) and (95%CI = 0.66-0.81). Furthermore, the pooled LR+ and negative LR- \\n      were determined to be 3.37 (95%CI = 2.53-4.50) and 0.18 (95%CI = 0.15-0.21),\\n      respectively. The experimental results showed that the pooled DOR of thyroid\\n      nodules was 18.83 (95% CI = 13.21-26.84). In addition, area under SROC curve was \\n      determined to be 0.89 (SE = 0.0124). It should be pointed out that there is no\\n      evidence of bias (i.e. t = 0.25, P = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: Through this\\n      meta-analysis, it can be seen that the accuracy of s-detect is relatively high\\n      for the effective distinction between malignant thyroid nodules and benign\\n      thyroid nodules.\\nFAU - Zhong, Lin\\nAU  - Zhong L\\nAD  - Pathology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical\\n      University, Dalian, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Cong\\nAU  - Wang C\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5878-5889\\nAD  - Ultrasound Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical\\n      University, Dalian, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - PLoS One\\nJT  - PloS one\\nJID - 101285081\\nSB  - IM\\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:32\\nPHST- 2021/08/17 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/13 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:32 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272149 [doi]\\nAID - PONE-D-21-26569 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - PLoS One. 2022 Aug 5;17(8):e0272149. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0272149.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35930524\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1469-7793 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0022-3751 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Near-infrared spectroscopy estimation of combined skeletal muscle oxidative\\n      capacity and O2 diffusion capacity in humans.\\nLID - 10.1113/JP283267 [doi]\\nAB  - KEY POINTS: We determined post-exercise recovery kinetics of quadriceps muscle\\n      oxygen uptake (mVO2 ) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in humans\\n      under conditions of both non-limiting (HIGH) and limiting (LOW) O2 availability, \\n      for comparison with biopsy variables. The mVO2 recovery rate constant in HIGH O2 \\n      availability was hypothesized to reflect muscle oxidative capacity (kHIGH ); and \\n      the difference in k between HIGH and LOW O2 availability (k) was hypothesized to \\n      reflect muscle O2 diffusing capacity. kHIGH was correlated with phosphorylating\\n      oxidative capacity of permeabilized muscle fiber bundles (r = 0.80). k was\\n      negatively correlated with capillary density (r = -0.68) of biopsy samples. NIRS \\n      provides non-invasive means of assessing both muscle oxidative and oxygen\\n      diffusing capacity in vivo. ABSTRACT: The final steps of the O2 cascade during\\n      exercise depend on the product of the microvascular-to-intramyocyte PO2\\n      difference and muscle O2 diffusing capacity (DmO2 ). Non-invasive methods to\\n      determine DmO2 in humans are currently unavailable. Muscle oxygen uptake (mVO2 ) \\n      recovery rate constant (k), measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) using\\n      intermittent arterial occlusions, is associated with muscle oxidative capacity in\\n      vivo. We reasoned that k would be limited by DmO2 when muscle oxygenation is low \\n      (kLOW ), and hypothesized that: i) k in well-oxygenated muscle (kHIGH ) is\\n      associated with maximal O2 flux in fiber bundles; and ii) k (kHIGH -kLOW ) is\\n      associated with capillary density (CD). Vastus lateralis k was measured in 12\\n      participants using NIRS after moderate exercise. The timing and duration of\\n      arterial occlusions were manipulated to maintain tissue saturation index (TSI)\\n      within a 10% range either below (LOW) or above (HIGH) half-maximal desaturation, \\n      assessed during sustained arterial occlusion. Maximal O2 flux in phosphorylating \\n      state was 37.7+/-10.6 pmol.s(-1) .mg(-1) ( approximately 5.8 ml.min(-1) .100g(-1)\\n      ). CD ranged 348 to 586 mm(-2) . kHIGH was greater than kLOW (3.15+/-0.45 vs\\n      1.56+/-0.79 min(-1) , p<0.001). Maximal O2 flux was correlated with kHIGH (r =\\n      0.80, p = 0.002) but not kLOW (r = -0.10, p = 0.755). Deltak ranged -0.26 to\\n      -2.55 min(-1) , and correlated with CD (r = -0.68, p = 0.015). mVO2 k reflects\\n      muscle oxidative capacity only in well-oxygenated muscle. k, the difference in k \\n      between well- and poorly-oxygenated muscle, was associated with CD, a mediator of\\n      DmO2 . Assessment of muscle k and k using NIRS provides a non-invasive window on \\n      muscle oxidative and O2 diffusing capacity. Abstract figure legend NIRS probe was\\n      positioned on vastus lateralis muscle and used to assess both muscle oxidative\\n      and oxygen diffusing capacity in vivo by intermittent arterial occlusions. Timing\\n      and duration of each occlusion were manipulated to maintain tissue saturation\\n      index (TSI) within a 10percentage range either below (LOW) or above (HIGH)\\n      half-maximal desaturation. Recovery rate constant (k) of muscle oxygen\\n      consumption (mVO2 ) obtained by NIRS was correlated to phosphorylating oxidative \\n      capacity of permeabilized muscle fiber bundles. Changes in recovery rate constant\\n      (a inverted question mark inverted question markk) were correlated to capillary\\n      density calculated from cross-section of muscle samples obtained by\\n      immunofluorescence.

METHODS: An\\n      online questionnaire was developed by the Periodontology Departments of Tel Aviv \\n      (IL) and Frankfurt University (GE) to address demographics, training, prevention,\\n      and treatment of peri-implant diseases. The questionnaire was distributed by DHP \\n      associations via social media. RESULTS: The responses of 376 DHPs (IL: 169; GE:\\n      207) were analyzed. Most participants were female (IL: 168/99%; GE: 203/98%), had\\n      received education (IL: 179/97%; GE: 207/97%), and were working in their home\\n      countries (IL: 182/99%; GE: 211/99%). Peri-implant probing was not performed by\\n      22% of DHPs in IL and 5% in GE. Of the DHPs who used probes, 49% used metal\\n      probes in IL, while 40% used plastic probes in GE (p < 0.001). A majority of DHPs\\n      performed peri-implant instrumentation (IL: 168/99%; GE: 190/92%). Most DHPs from\\n      IL did not use devices other than hand and/or sonic/ultrasonic instruments for\\n      peri-implant cleaning (IL: 130/77%; GE 5/2%); in GE, the use of airflow (IL:\\n      31/18%; GE: 199/96%) is popular (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most DHPs in IL and GE \\n      perform peri-implant probing and debridement.

However, the sEMG\\n      has inherent limitations as well as the gesture classification and force\\n      estimation have not been effectively combined. There are limitations in\\n      applications such as prosthetic control and clinical rehabilitation, etc. In this\\n      paper, a grasping gesture and force recognition strategy based on wearable A-mode\\n      ultrasound and two-stage cascade model is proposed, which can simultaneously\\n      estimate the force while classifying the grasping gesture. This paper experiments\\n      five grasping gestures and four force levels (5-50%MVC). The results demonstrate \\n      that the performance of the proposed model is significantly better than that of\\n      the traditional model both in classification and regression (p<0.001).\\n      Additionally, the two-stage cascade regression model (TSCRM) used the Gaussian\\n      Process regression model (GPR) with the mean and standard deviation (MSD) feature\\n      obtains excellent results, with normalized root-mean-square error (nRMSE) and\\n      correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.1049+/-0.0374 and 0.9461+/-0.0354,\\n      respectively. Besides, the latency of the model meets the requirement of\\n      real-time recognition (T<15ms). Therefore, the research outcomes prove the\\n      feasibility of the proposed recognition strategy and provide a reference for the \\n      field of prosthetic control, etc.\\nFAU - Zengyu, Qing\\nAU  - Zengyu Q\\nFAU - Zongxing, Lu\\nAU  - Zongxing L\\nFAU - Zhoujie, Liu\\nAU  - Zhoujie L\\nFAU - Yingjie, Cai\\nAU  - Yingjie C\\nFAU - Shaoxiong, Cai\\nAU  - Shaoxiong C\\nFAU - Baizheng, He\\nAU  - Baizheng H\\nFAU - Ligang, Yao\\nAU  - Ligang Y\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng\\nJT  - IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a\\n      publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society\\nJID - 101097023\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:22\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:22 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3196926 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng. 2022 Aug 5;PP. doi:\\n      10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3196926.\\n\\nPMID- 35930508\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2168-2208 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2168-2194 (Linking)\\nVI  - PP\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Decomposition model of hybrid variation-sparse representation for medical image\\n      fusion and denoising.\\nLID - 10.1109/JBHI.2022.3196710 [doi]\\nAB  - Medical image fusion technology integrates the contents of medical images of\\n      different modalities, thereby assisting users of medical images to better\\n      understand their meaning. However, the fusion of medical images corrupted by\\n      noise remains a challenge. To solve the existing problems in medical image fusion\\n      and denoising algorithms related to excessive blur, unclean denoising, gradient\\n      information loss, and color distortion, a novel medical image fusion and\\n      denoising algorithm is proposed. First, a new image layer decomposition model\\n      based on hybrid variation-sparse representation and weighted Schatten p-norm is\\n      proposed. The alternating direction method of multipliers is used to update the\\n      structure, detail layer dictionary, and detail layer coefficient map of the input\\n      image while denoising. Subsequently, appropriate fusion rules are employed for\\n      the structure layers and detail layer coefficient maps. Finally, the fused image \\n      is restored using the fused structure layer, detail layer dictionary, and detail \\n      layer coefficient maps. A large number of experiments confirm the superiority of \\n      the proposed algorithm over other algorithms. The proposed medical image fusion\\n      and denoising algorithm can effectively remove noise while retaining the gradient\\n      information without color distortion.\\nFAU - Wang, Guofen\\nAU  - Wang G\\nFAU - Li, Weisheng\\nAU  - Li W\\nFAU - Du, Jiao\\nAU  - Du J\\nFAU - Xiao, Bin\\nAU  - Xiao B\\nFAU - Gao, Xinbo\\nAU  - Gao X\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - IEEE J Biomed Health Inform\\nJT  - IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics\\nJID - 101604520\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:22\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:22 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1109/JBHI.2022.3196710 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - IEEE J Biomed Health Inform. 2022 Aug 5;PP. doi: 10.1109/JBHI.2022.3196710.\\n\\nPMID- 35930494\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1362-3095 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0955-3002 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - The use of the normal tissue non-complication probability (NTCP0) in the safety\\n      evaluations as a new alternative of assessing the side-effects of the radiation\\n      oncology treatments.\\nPG  - 1-21\\nLID - 10.1080/09553002.2022.2110299 [doi]\\nAB  - PURPOSE: To encourage the use of the NTCP0 for evaluating safety as a new\\n      alternative of assessing the S-Es of the radiation oncology treatments; and the\\n      use of the \"NTCP0cal\" methodology that calculates/estimates NTCP0. METHOD:\\n      Revisions of studies related to use of the NTCP in the evaluations of S-Es.\\n      Development of the first version of the Matlab application of our methodology,\\n      which provides three options, two of them employ the well-known aspects of a\\n      phenomenological model, or the relationship with the TNTCP; where NTCP0 =\\n      100%-TNTCP; and the third option determines NTCP0 from an assumed NTCP discrete\\n      probabilistic distribution from the binomial distribution, where one of its\\n      parameters is automatically defined from a databased of the Disease locations Vs.\\n      Late complications. RESULT: As result of revisions of some QUANTEC studies, we\\n      can say that: 1) The majority of current NTCP models are DVH-based; 2) The risk\\n      of toxicity is the way of evaluating the S-Es of the radiation oncology\\n      treatments; and 3) The NTCP are used mainly for evaluations of individual or\\n      principal complications or Endpoints of the radiation treatments. The \"NTCP0cal\" \\n      Matlab application developed in this study has three calculation options. Two of \\n      the options provide additional graphical information about the distributions.\\n      CONCLUSIONS: The NTCP0 is a new radiobiological concept, its introduction let to \\n      correct some current P + and UTCP formulations, and will allow evaluating S-Es in\\n      whatever activity involving ionizing radiation, like radiation treatments; and\\n      its phenomenological model function of dose prescribed (D = n*d) will allow\\n      calculating values of NTCP0 for a range of dose per fraction (d) in a treatment\\n      with a determined number of fractions (n), or for range of n for a constant d.\\n      The DVH is irrelevant for this model. For whatever radiation treatment given to a\\n      population of similar patients under similar circumstances, the NTCP0 is\\n      calculated as ratio of the number of patients without acute/late complications\\n      and total of them. When this number is unknown, then NTCP0 can be obtained using \\n      the \"NTCP0cal\" application.\\nFAU - Frometa-Castillo, Terman\\nAU  - Frometa-Castillo T\\nAD  - Owner at Statistical models project, LLC. 6134 N Oakley Ave Unit 2, Chicago, IL, \\n      60659, USA.

We aimed to investigate the correlation of\\n      musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) and clinical examination results and relate\\n      them to arthritis relapse rate. METHODS: JIA patients with questionable presence \\n      of active arthritis (Q-joints) and controls (JIA and healthy children) were\\n      recruited. MSUS of Q-joints, active joints and their inactive counterparts was\\n      performed at study entry. Standard disease activity parameters were prospectively\\n      recorded. RESULTS: Of 481 joints of 138 JIA patients, 99 joints (20.6%) of 58\\n      patients had one or more Q-joints with 54/99 (54.5%) having MSUS features of\\n      active disease. Clinically inactive joints had lower proportion of MSUS synovitis\\n      (78/253, 30.8%) while MSUS activity was present in 114/129 (88.4%) of clinically \\n      active joints and in 2/105 (1.9%) joints of 36 healthy controls. Within the\\n      15-month follow-up 23/99 (22%) Q-joints and 31/253 (12%) clinically inactive\\n      joints relapsed. Joints with subclinical synovitis relapsed more frequently than \\n      MSUS inactive ones (p<0.001). The relapse rate was higher in MSUS-active Q-joints\\n      (19/23, 82%) than in clinically inactive ones (16/31, 52%) with MSUS synovial\\n      hypertrophy as the main relapse predictor in multivariate analysis. Ankle and\\n      knee joints relapsed most frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledgement of joints with\\n      questionable synovitis may contribute to the assessment of disease activity in\\n      JIA. Presence of MSUS synovitis carries a clinically meaningful risk of disease\\n      recurrence in these joints. In clinical practice, our findings encourage timely\\n      MSUS assessment of the joints in question, especially in patients without any\\n      other features of active disease.\\nFAU - Fingerhutova, Sarka\\nAU  - Fingerhutova S\\nAD  - Centre for Paediatric Rheumatology and Autoinflammatory Diseases, Department of\\n      Paediatrics and Inherited Metabolic Disorders, General University Hospital and\\n      1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.\\nFAU - Srp, Radoslav\\nAU  - Srp R\\nAD  - Centre for Paediatric Rheumatology and Autoinflammatory Diseases, Department of\\n      Paediatrics and Inherited Metabolic Disorders, General University Hospital and\\n      1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, and Department of\\n      Paediatrics, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk\\n      University, Brno, Czech Republic.\\nFAU - Hurnakova, Jana\\nAU  - Hurnakova J\\nAD  - Department of Paediatric and Adult Rheumatology, Motol University Hospital,\\n      Prague, Czech Republic.\\nFAU - Hrdinova, Hana\\nAU  - Hrdinova H\\nAD  - Department of Paediatric and Adult Rheumatology, Motol University Hospital,\\n      Prague, Czech Republic.\\nFAU - Nemcova, Dana\\nAU  - Nemcova D\\nAD  - Centre for Paediatric Rheumatology and Autoinflammatory Diseases, Department of\\n      Paediatrics and Inherited Metabolic Disorders, General University Hospital and\\n      1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.\\nFAU - Vinsova, Nikol\\nAU  - Vinsova N\\nAD  - Centre for Paediatric Rheumatology and Autoinflammatory Diseases, Department of\\n      Paediatrics and Inherited Metabolic Disorders, General University Hospital and\\n      1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.\\nFAU - Sladka Svestkova, Natalie\\nAU  - Sladka Svestkova N\\nAD  - Centre for Paediatric Rheumatology and Autoinflammatory Diseases, Department of\\n      Paediatrics and Inherited Metabolic Disorders, General University Hospital and\\n      1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.\\nFAU - Dolezalova, Pavla\\nAU  - Dolezalova P\\nAD  - Centre for Paediatric Rheumatology and Autoinflammatory Diseases, Department of\\n      Paediatrics and Inherited Metabolic Disorders, General University Hospital and\\n      1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.\\n      pavla.dolezalova@vfn.cz.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - Italy\\nTA  - Clin Exp Rheumatol\\nJT  - Clinical and experimental rheumatology\\nJID - 8308521\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 13:03\\nPHST- 2022/04/25 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/24 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 13:03 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 18689 [pii]\\nAID - 10.55563/clinexprheumatol/5lk4x2 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Clin Exp Rheumatol. 2022 Aug 5. pii: 18689. doi:\\n      10.55563/clinexprheumatol/5lk4x2.\\n\\nPMID- 35930491\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1362-3095 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0955-3002 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Chromosome aberrations, micronucleus frequency, and catalase concentration in a\\n      population chronically exposed to high levels of radon.\\nPG  - 1-54\\nLID - 10.1080/09553002.2022.2110314 [doi]\\nAB  - PURPOSE: To deepen our knowledge on the effects of high levels of indoor radon\\n      exposure, we assessed the frequencies of unstable and stable chromosome\\n      aberrations and micronucleus (MN), as well as the concentration of an endogenous \\n      antioxidant (catalase; CAT), in blood samples of individuals chronically exposed \\n      to high indoor radon concentrations in Indonesia (Tande-Tande sub-village,\\n      Mamuju, West Sulawesi). Moreover, we also investigated the occurrence of a\\n      radio-adaptive response (RAR) in Tande-Tande sub-village inhabitants using the G2\\n      MN assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The frequencies of dicentric (DC), acentric\\n      (AF), ring (R) and translocation (Tr) chromosomes in Tande-Tande inhabitants were\\n      compared to those in people living in a reference area with low levels of indoor \\n      radon levels (Topoyo village, Indonesia). The number of MN per 1000 binucleated\\n      cells (BNC) and CAT concentration per total protein were quantified and compared \\n      between groups. Lastly, we irradiated (2 Gy) phytohemagglutinin-stimulated\\n      samples in vitro and measured the frequency of MN to verify the occurrence of a\\n      RAR in Tande-Tande sub-village inhabitants. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The\\n      frequencies of DC, AF and Tr did not differ between Tande-Tande inhabitants and\\n      control subjects (p = 0.350, 0.521, 0.597). The frequency of MN in Tande-Tande\\n      inhabitants was significantly lower than that in the control group (p = 0.006).\\n      Similarly, CAT concentration in Tande-Tande inhabitants was also significantly\\n      lower than that in the control population (p < 0.001). Significant negative\\n      correlations were identified for MN number and CAT concentration versus indoor\\n      radon concentration, annual effective dose, or cumulative dose both within groups\\n      and when all data were analyzed together. Our findings indicate that, despite the\\n      high indoor radon levels, Tande-Tande inhabitants are not under oxidative stress,\\n      since this group had lower CAT concentration and MN frequency than those in the\\n      control group. The negative correlation between MN frequency and indoor radon\\n      concentration, annual effective dose, and cumulative dose suggests the occurrence\\n      of a radio-adaptive response (RAR) phenomenon in Tande-Tande sub-village\\n      inhabitants.

Only\\n      patients with clinical diagnosis of gout were eligible. Disease-activity was\\n      evaluated by the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) on a visual analogue\\n      scale (VAS, 0=unsatisfactory, 100=satisfactory) at 0 (T0) and 12 months (T12),\\n      and the composite score called Gout Activity Score (GAS) calculated on the number\\n      of arthritic attacks (flare count), serum uric acid (sUA), cumulative number of\\n      tophi, VAS (T12), PtGA (T12). Multivariate linear regression model was performed \\n      to assess predictors of gout disease-activity at T12 with PASS and GAS as\\n      outcomes. RESULTS: 201 patients had gout (diagnosis on synovial fluid in 45%,\\n      tophi in 26%, mean sUA 7.4+/-1.9 mg/L, 85% with urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in\\n      progress/initiated at T0); mean age 63+/-13 years, 88% men, median (interquartile\\n      range) disease duration 2.9 years (0.7-9.4).

Here we showed that standardized pondus hydrogenii\\n      (pH) of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of bronchiectasis patients was\\n      significantly lower than that of controls and was significantly correlated with\\n      bronchiectasis severity index (BSI) scores and disease prognosis. EBC pH was\\n      lower in severe patients than that in mild and moderate patients. Besides, acidic\\n      microenvironment deteriorated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) pulmonary\\n      infection in mice models. Mechanistically, acidic microenvironment increased P.\\n      aeruginosa outer membrane vesicles (PA_OMVs) release and boosted it induced the\\n      activation of interferon regulatory factor3 (IRF3)-interferonbeta (IFN-beta)\\n      signaling pathway, ultimately compromised the anti-bacteria immunity. Targeted\\n      knockout of IRF3 or type 1 interferon receptor (IFNAR1) alleviated lung damage\\n      and lethality of mice after P. aeruginosa infection that aggravated by acidic\\n      microenvironment. Together, these findings identified airway acidification\\n      impaired host resistance to P. aeruginosa infection by enhancing its induced the \\n      activation of IRF3-IFN-beta signaling pathway. Standardized EBC pH may be a\\n      useful biomarker of disease severity and a potential therapeutic target for the\\n      refractory P. aeruginosa infection.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of\\n      telerehabilitation on pain and disability in patients with spine pain treated\\n      during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare the results to in-clinic rehabilitation.\\n      MATERIALS & METHODS: In this propensity score-matched analysis, 428 patients with\\n      spine pain who underwent telerehabilitation during the 6 months of COVID-19\\n      pandemic lockdown and 428 patients who underwent in-clinic multimodal\\n      rehabilitation treatment during the 6-month period prior to lockdown were\\n      compared. Propensity score matching was done based on gender, age, pre-treatment \\n      pain, and disability. Post-treatment numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), Oswestry\\n      or Neck disability index (ODI or NDI), and minimal clinical important difference \\n      (MCID) achieved for NPRS and ODI/NDI scores were compared between the 2 groups.\\n      RESULTS: Post-treatment, the mean NPRS (mean difference - 1, p < 0.0001) and\\n      ODI/NDI (mean difference - 5.8, p < 0.0001) scores, were significantly lower in\\n      the telerehabilitation group when compared to control group. Similarly, the\\n      percentage of patients who achieved MCID of >/= 2 for NPRS (mean difference - 6%,\\n      p = 0.0007) and MCID of >/= 10 for ODI/NDI (mean difference - 7.5%, p = 0.005)\\n      scores were significantly higher in the telerehabilitation group.

OBJECTIVES: To define the prevalence and risk factors of\\n      suspected ILD and assess outcomes. METHODS: Suspected ILD was evaluated in the\\n      COPDGene cohort, defined as ILA and at least one additional criterion: definite\\n      fibrosis on CT, FVC less than 80% predicted, or DLCO less than 70% predicted.\\n      Multivariable linear, longitudinal, and Cox proportional hazards regression\\n      models were used to assess associations with St. George\\'s Respiratory\\n      Questionnaire (SGRQ), Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), supplemental oxygen use,\\n      respiratory exacerbations, and mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 4361 \\n      participants with available data, 239 (5%) had evidence for suspected ILD while\\n      204 (5%) had ILA without suspected ILD. In multivariable analyses, suspected ILD \\n      was associated with increased SGRQ score (mean difference [MD] 3.8points; 95%\\n      confidence interval [CI] 0.6-7.1; P=0.02), reduced 6MWT (MD -35m; 95%CI\\n      -56m,-13m; P=0.002), greater supplemental oxygen use (odds ratio [OR] 2.3; 95%CI \\n      1.1-5.1; P=0.03) and severe respiratory exacerbations (OR 2.9; 95%CI 1.1-7.5;\\n      P=0.03), and higher mortality (hazard ratio 2.4; 95%CI 1.2-4.6; P=0.01) compared \\n      to ILA without suspected ILD. Risk factors associated with suspected ILD included\\n      self-identified black race (OR 2.0; 95%CI 1.1-3.3; P=0.01) and pack-years smoking\\n      history (OR 1.2; 95%CI 1.1-1.3; P=0.0005).

We investigated the associations between skin \\n      pigmentation (M-index; skin reflectance spectrophotometry), serum vitamin D\\n      concentration [25(OH)D], circulating inflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and \\n      IL-10) concentrations, and the NO contribution to local heating-induced cutaneous\\n      vasodilation (%NO-mediated vasodilation) in a diversely pigmented cohort of\\n      healthy, young adults. An intradermal microdialysis fiber was placed in the\\n      forearms of 33 healthy adults (14M/19W; 18-27 yrs; M-index, 30-81 a.u.) for local\\n      delivery of pharmacological agents. Lactated Ringer\\'s solution was perfused\\n      through the fiber during local heating-induced (39 degrees C) cutaneous\\n      vasodilation. After attaining stable elevated blood flow, 15mM\\n      N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; nitric oxide synthase inhibiter) was \\n      infused at all sites to quantify %NO-mediated vasodilation. Red cell flux was\\n      measured (laser-Doppler flowmetry; LDF) and cutaneous vascular conductance\\n      (CVC=LDF/MAP) was normalized to maximal (%CVCmax; 28mM sodium nitroprusside+43\\n      degrees C). Serum [25(OH)D] and circulating cytokines were analyzed by ELISA and \\n      multiplex assay, respectively. M-index was negatively associated with [25(OH)D]\\n      (r=-0.57, p<0.0001) and %NO-mediated vasodilation (r=-0.42, p=0.02). Serum\\n      [25(OH)D] was positively related to %NO (r=0.41, p=0.02). There was a negative\\n      curvilinear relation between [25(OH)D] and circulating IL-6 (r=-0.56, p<0.001)\\n      but not TNF-alpha or IL-10 (p>/=0.14). IL-6 was not associated with %NO-mediated \\n      vasodilation (p=0.44).

It is well-recognized as a complication in chronic diseases such as\\n      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, little is known about sarcopenia \\n      in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study aimed to\\n      investigate the clinical characteristics of sarcopenia and the association\\n      between quality of life and sarcopenia in patients with IPF. METHODS: In this\\n      pilot cross-sectional study, 56 Japanese outpatients with IPF (49 men) were\\n      enrolled prospectively. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the criteria of the\\n      Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019. Its associations with clinical\\n      parameters including age, pulmonary functions, physical performance, and\\n      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were examined. RESULTS: The frequency of\\n      sarcopenia was 39.3% (n = 22) in this cohort. There were significant differences \\n      in St George\\'s Respiratory Questionnaire (p = .005), modified Medical Research\\n      Council score (p = .004), and Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale depression\\n      score (p = .030) between the sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic groups. On\\n      multivariate regression analysis, 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was an independent\\n      factor associated with sarcopenia (odds ratio 1.241, 95% confidence interval\\n      1.016-1.515, p = .034).

The purpose of this study was threefold: (1) to\\n      develop preliminary norms on the SMART; (2) to examine the relationship between\\n      demographic variables (i.e. age, sex, education), device type used, and SMART\\n      performance; and (3) to assess user attitudes of the SMART. Method A sample of\\n      1,050 community-dwelling adults (M age =59.5 (15.2), M education = 16.5 (2.1),\\n      67.1% female, 96% white) was recruited from an ongoing web-based research cohort.\\n      Participants completed the SMART, which consists of four face-valid cognitive\\n      tasks assessing visual memory, attention/processing speed, and executive\\n      functioning. SMART performance outcome metrics were subtest completion time (CT),\\n      click count, and total CT. Participants provided demographic information and\\n      completed a survey of user attitudes toward the SMART (i.e. usability,\\n      acceptability). Results Older age was the only demographic variable associated\\n      with slower SMART total CT (r = .60, p <.001). Education was not associated with \\n      SMART CT or click counts overall (p > .05). Male sex was generally associated\\n      with longer SMART CT (p < .001, partial eta squared = .14) on all sub-tests.\\n      Regarding acceptability, 97.3% indicated willingness to take the SMART again,\\n      with more than half willing to complete it on a weekly basis.

METHODS: A structural form was designed\\n      comprising measures of physical, cognitive, and operational abilities which were \\n      required to perform manual PD independently. The evaluation was jointly conducted\\n      by a PD nurse, a nephrologist and a close family member of the patient. Patients \\n      who met all the requirements were deemed as capable of performing PD\\n      independently (self-care PD) and others were deemed as needing an assistant\\n      (assisted PD). RESULTS: The evaluation form was applied in 280 prevalent PD\\n      patients and 33.9% of them were assessed as needing assisted PD, mainly due to\\n      physical (62.1%) or operational (66.3%) disabilities. The evaluation result was\\n      consistent with current dialysis status in 79.3% patients and it matched better\\n      in patients who performed PD with the help of an assistant (93.0 vs. 76.8%, p =\\n      0.014). Patients who were evaluated as having barriers to self-care PD but still \\n      performed PD without an assistant were older and demonstrated higher prevalence\\n      of diabetic nephropathy and PD-related infection, lower education level, and\\n      lower serum albumin (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The PD practice ability assessment\\n      form is useful to identify patients with barriers to self-care PD. It provides\\n      objective information to the patients and their family to choose feasible PD\\n      practice modality, self-care, or assisted PD.\\nFAU - Huang, Jiaying\\nAU  - Huang J\\nAD  - Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Center for\\n      Peritoneal Dialysis Research, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, PR China.\\nFAU - Gu, Aiping\\nAU  - Gu A\\nAD  - Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Center for\\n      Peritoneal Dialysis Research, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, PR China.\\nFAU - Li, Na\\nAU  - Li N\\nAD  - Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Center for\\n      Peritoneal Dialysis Research, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, PR China.\\nFAU - He, Yanna\\nAU  - He Y\\nAD  - Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Center for\\n      Peritoneal Dialysis Research, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, PR China.\\nFAU - Xie, Weizhen\\nAU  - Xie W\\nAD  - Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Center for\\n      Peritoneal Dialysis Research, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, PR China.\\nFAU - Fang, Wei\\nAU  - Fang W\\nAD  - Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Center for\\n      Peritoneal Dialysis Research, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, PR China.\\nFAU - Yuan, Jiangzi\\nAU  - Yuan J\\nAD  - Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Center for\\n      Peritoneal Dialysis Research, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, PR China.\\nFAU - Jiang, Na\\nAU  - Jiang N\\nAD  - Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Center for\\n      Peritoneal Dialysis Research, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, PR China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Ren Fail\\nJT  - Renal failure\\nJID - 8701128\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - PD practice ability\\nOT  - Peritoneal dialysis\\nOT  - assisted PD\\nOT  - barriers to self-care PD\\nOT  - self-care PD\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 12:43\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 12:43 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/0886022X.2022.2108448 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Ren Fail. 2022 Dec;44(1):1319-1325. doi: 10.1080/0886022X.2022.2108448.\\n\\nPMID- 35930433\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1502-7708 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0036-5521 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - The possible association of proton pump inhibitor use with acute cholangitis in\\n      patients with choledocholithiasis: a multi-center study.\\nPG  - 1-5\\nLID - 10.1080/00365521.2022.2106150 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Gallstone disease is common worldwide and can lead to severe\\n      complications, including cholangitis; thus, it is important to identify\\n      modifiable risk factors for cholangitis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are\\n      commonly prescribed to treat gastroenterological disorders. We aimed to explore\\n      whether PPI use is associated with an increased risk of acute cholangitis in\\n      patients with gallstone disease. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study\\n      included all patients arriving to the hospital over a 10-year period with various\\n      presentations of choledocholithiasis. We compared active PPI use in two groups:\\n      those with cholangitis (group A) vs. without cholangitis (group B). RESULTS:\\n      Overall, 811 patients were included, 161 in group A and 650 in group B. The\\n      average age +/- standard deviation (SD) in groups A and B was 74.5 +/- 20.6 vs.\\n      61.6 +/- 20.9 years, respectively. PPI use in group A was higher vs. group B\\n      (42.9% vs. 29.1%, p = 0.001). On univariate analysis, male gender (OR 1.47, 95%\\n      confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.08), age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05), ischemic\\n      heart disease (IHD) (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.07-2.64), hyperlipidemia (OR 1.59, 95% CI \\n      1.11-2.29), hypertension (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.28-2.57) and PPI use (OR 1.83, 95% CI\\n      1.28-2.61), all were associated with acute cholangitis. On multivariate analysis,\\n      only PPI use kept its association after adjustment for age (OR 1.64, 95% CI\\n      1.2-3.7). CONCLUSIONS: Active PPI use was associated with a higher rate of\\n      cholangitis among patients with choledocholithiasis. We advocate considering this\\n      risk before prescribing PPIs to patients with gallstones.

The main objective of this study was \\n      to analyze the effects of gender differences on outcomes in hospitalizations\\n      related to Esophageal variceal bleeding in the United States. METHODS: A\\n      retrospective observational cohort study was performed using the National\\n      Inpatient Sample (NIS) database for all hospitalizations with a discharge\\n      diagnosis of esophageal varices with hemorrhage from 2016 to 2019. The primary\\n      outcome was in-hospital mortality, while secondary outcomes included rate of\\n      early endoscopy (defined as less than 1 day), AKI, blood transfusion, sepsis, ICU\\n      admission and TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt). We also\\n      compared the length of stay and total hospitalization charges. RESULTS: We\\n      identified a total of 166,760 patients with variceal bleeding of which 32.7% were\\n      females. In-hospital mortality was higher in males, 9.91%, compared to females,\\n      8.31% (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.88, p-value=.008, when adjusted for\\n      confounding factors). The odds of undergoing an EGD, length of stay, or total\\n      hospitalization charges did not differ between the two groups. Compared to men,\\n      women had lower odds of receiving TIPS (aOR = 0.83, p-value=.002). CONCLUSION:\\n      Women hospitalised with esophageal variceal bleeding are at a lower risk of death\\n      compared to males. Further research is needed to elucidate the factors associated\\n      with this lower risk.\\nFAU - Sohal, Aalam\\nAU  - Sohal A\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8365-7240\\nAD  - Department of Internal Medicine, University of California, Fresno, CA, USA.\\nFAU - Chaudhry, Hunza\\nAU  - Chaudhry H\\nAD  - Department of Internal Medicine, University of California, Fresno, CA, USA.\\nFAU - Dhaliwal, Armaan\\nAU  - Dhaliwal A\\nAD  - Department of Internal Medicine, University of Arizona, South Campus-Tucson, AZ, \\n      USA.\\nFAU - Singla, Piyush\\nAU  - Singla P\\nAD  - Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Punjab, India.\\nFAU - Gupta, Gagan\\nAU  - Gupta G\\nAD  - Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Punjab, India.\\nFAU - Sharma, Raghav\\nAU  - Sharma R\\nAD  - Punjab Institute of Medical Sciences, Punjab, India.\\nFAU - Dukovic, Dino\\nAU  - Dukovic D\\nAD  - Ross University School of Medicine, Bridgetown, Barbados.\\nFAU - Prajapati, Devang\\nAU  - Prajapati D\\nAD  - Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of California, Fresno, \\n      CA, USA.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Ann Med\\nJT  - Annals of medicine\\nJID - 8906388\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Gender\\nOT  - cirrhosis\\nOT  - disparities\\nOT  - variceal bleeding\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 12:32\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 12:32 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/07853890.2022.2104920 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Ann Med. 2022 Dec;54(1):2115-2122. doi: 10.1080/07853890.2022.2104920.\\n\\nPMID- 35930383\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1365-2060 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0785-3890 (Linking)\\nVI  - 54\\nIP  - 1\\nDP  - 2022 Dec\\nTI  - Serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 as a potential biomarker for\\n      diagnosis and prognosis of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\\nPG  - 2153-2166\\nLID - 10.1080/07853890.2022.2104921 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) has been\\n      reported to be related to the risk of some cancers. Here we focussed on serum\\n      IGFBP3 as a possible biomarker of diagnosis and prognosis for oesophageal\\n      squamous carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was\\n      used to measure the serum IGFBP3 level in the training cohort including 136 ESCC \\n      patients and 119 normal controls and the validation cohort with 55 ESCC patients \\n      and 42 normal controls. The receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) was\\n      used to assess the diagnosis value. Cox proportional hazards model was applied to\\n      select factors for survival nomogram construction. RESULTS: Serum IGFBP3 levels\\n      were significantly lower in early-stage ESCC or ESCC patients than those in\\n      normal controls (p < .05). The specificity and sensitivity of serum IGFBP3 for\\n      the diagnosis of ESCC were 95.80% and 50.00%, respectively, with the area under\\n      the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.788 in the training cohort. Similar results were\\n      observed in the validation cohort (88.10%, 38.18%, and 0.710). Importantly, serum\\n      IGFBP3 could also differentiate early-stage ESCC from controls (95.80%, 52.54%,\\n      0.777 and 88.10%, 36.36%, 0.695 in training and validation cohorts,\\n      respectively). Furthermore, Cox multivariate analysis revealed that serum IGFBP3 \\n      was an independent prognostic risk factor (HR = 2.599, p = .002). Lower serum\\n      IGFBP3 level was correlated with reduced overall survival (p < .05). Nomogram\\n      based on serum IGFBP3, TNM stage, and tumour size improved the prognostic\\n      prediction of ESCC with a concordance index of 0.715. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated\\n      that serum IGFBP3 was a potential biomarker of diagnosis and prognosis for ESCC. \\n      Meanwhile, the nomogram might help predict the prognosis of ESCC. Key\\n      MessageSerum IGFBP3 showed early diagnostic value in oesophageal squamous cell\\n      carcinoma with independent cohort validation. Moreover, serum IGFBP3 was\\n      identified as an independent prognostic risk factor, which was used to construct \\n      a nomogram with improved prognosis ability in oesophageal squamous cell\\n      carcinoma.\\nFAU - Luo, Yun\\nAU  - Luo Y\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou\\n      University Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nAD  - Precision Medicine Research Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, \\n      China.\\nFAU - Hong, Chao-Qun\\nAU  - Hong CQ\\nAD  - Department of Oncological Laboratory Research, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou\\n      University Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nFAU - Huang, Bin-Liang\\nAU  - Huang BL\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou\\n      University Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nAD  - Precision Medicine Research Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, \\n      China.\\nAD  - Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Ding, Tian-Yan\\nAU  - Ding TY\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou\\n      University Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nAD  - Precision Medicine Research Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, \\n      China.\\nFAU - Chu, Ling-Yu\\nAU  - Chu LY\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou\\n      University Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nAD  - Precision Medicine Research Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, \\n      China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Biao\\nAU  - Zhang B\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou\\n      University Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nAD  - Precision Medicine Research Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, \\n      China.\\nFAU - Qu, Qi-Qi\\nAU  - Qu QQ\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou\\n      University Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nAD  - Precision Medicine Research Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, \\n      China.\\nFAU - Li, Xin-Hao\\nAU  - Li XH\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou\\n      University Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nAD  - Precision Medicine Research Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, \\n      China.\\nFAU - Liu, Can-Tong\\nAU  - Liu CT\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou\\n      University Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nAD  - Precision Medicine Research Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, \\n      China.\\nAD  - Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Peng, Yu-Hui\\nAU  - Peng YH\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou\\n      University Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nAD  - Precision Medicine Research Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, \\n      China.\\nAD  - Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Guo, Hai-Peng\\nAU  - Guo HP\\nAD  - Department of Head and Neck Surgery, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou University\\n      Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nFAU - Xu, Yi-Wei\\nAU  - Xu YW\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, the Cancer Hospital of Shantou\\n      University Medical College, Shantou, China.\\nAD  - Precision Medicine Research Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, \\n      China.\\nAD  - Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, Guangzhou, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Ann Med\\nJT  - Annals of medicine\\nJID - 8906388\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - ESCC serum biomarker\\nOT  - Serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3\\nOT  - diagnosis and prognosis\\nOT  - oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 12:13\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 12:13 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/07853890.2022.2104921 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Ann Med. 2022 Dec;54(1):2153-2166. doi: 10.1080/07853890.2022.2104921.\\n\\nPMID- 35930382\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1532-4311 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0882-0139 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - IKBKE and BANK1 Polymorphisms and Clinical Characteristics in Chinese Women with \\n      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.\\nPG  - 1-11\\nLID - 10.1080/08820139.2022.2108325 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Defects in apoptotic cell clearance is a pathogenic factor in\\n      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

There were no\\n      significant differences in BANK1 rs12640056 between different genotypes and\\n      clinical characteristics. CONCLUSION: IKBKE rs15672 G/A and BANK1 rs12640056C/T\\n      polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to SLE in Chinese women. This\\n      highlights the important role of these two SNPs in this disease and suggests that\\n      multiple genes from these pathways are candidates for functional studies and\\n      therapeutic targets.\\nFAU - Zhang, Ping\\nAU  - Zhang P\\nAD  - West China School of Medicine/Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China\\n      Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Zhai, Jianzhao\\nAU  - Zhai J\\nAD  - West China School of Medicine/Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China\\n      Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Kefen\\nAU  - Wang K\\nAD  - West China School of Medicine/Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China\\n      Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Wu, Yongkang\\nAU  - Wu Y\\nAD  - West China School of Medicine/Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China\\n      Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nAD  - Outpatient Department, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Immunol Invest\\nJT  - Immunological investigations\\nJID - 8504629\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - BANK1\\nOT  - IKBKE\\nOT  - single nucleotide polymorphisms\\nOT  - systemic lupus erythematosus\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 12:13\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 12:13 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/08820139.2022.2108325 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Immunol Invest. 2022 Aug 5:1-11. doi: 10.1080/08820139.2022.2108325.\\n\\nPMID- 35930380\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1535-1386 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0021-9355 (Linking)\\nVI  - 104\\nIP  - 15\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 3\\nTI  - Periprosthetic Osteolysis as a Risk Factor for Revision After Total Ankle\\n      Arthroplasty: A Single-Center Experience of 250 Consecutive Cases.\\nPG  - 1334-1340\\nLID - 10.2106/JBJS.21.01093 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Periprosthetic osteolysis after total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is a\\n      challenging problem. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of and\\n      predisposing factors for osteolysis and its effects on clinical outcomes.\\n      METHODS: We enrolled 236 patients (250 ankles) who underwent primary TAA using a \\n      mobile-bearing HINTEGRA prosthesis, with a mean follow-up of 83.5 months (range, \\n      36 to 182 months), and subsequently divided them into 2 groups: the osteolysis\\n      group (79 ankles) and non-osteolysis group (171 ankles). Clinical and\\n      radiographic outcomes were compared between the 2 groups, and a bivariable\\n      logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predisposing factors for\\n      the development of osteolysis. RESULTS: In the osteolysis group (31.6% of the 250\\n      ankles), the mean time of detection was 28.8 months postoperatively. Forty of\\n      these ankles were closely monitored without surgical treatment. Another 29 ankles\\n      underwent bone grafting and exchange of the polyethylene inlay, and the remaining\\n      10 ankles underwent revision TAA or arthrodesis. All clinical outcome variables\\n      were significantly lower in patients with osteolysis, compared with those without\\n      osteolysis, at the final follow-up (p < 0.05). In the investigation of\\n      predisposing factors, only rheumatoid arthritis was identified as having a\\n      significant association with an increased prevalence of osteolysis (p = 0.030).\\n      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the prevalence of periprosthetic\\n      osteolysis after TAA was considerable and that the development of osteolysis\\n      negatively affected the clinical outcome. Therefore, the prevention and\\n      appropriate treatment of osteolysis are crucial for the satisfactory long-term\\n      survival of TAA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

The\\n      current study was intended to assess DPP-4(Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4) inhibition\\n      mediated antidiabetic effect of phytocompounds of an aqueous fruit extract of\\n      Withania coagulans (Stocks) Dunal by in-vitro, in-silico and in-vivo approaches. \\n      The phytoconstituents screening was executed by LCMS (Liquid Chromatography with \\n      tandem mass spectrometry). The in-vitro and in-vivo, DPP-4 assays were performed \\n      by using available kits. The in-vitro DPP-4 activity was inhibited up to 68.3% by\\n      the test extract. Accordingly, in-silico determinations of molecular docking,\\n      molecular dynamics and pharmacokinetics were performed between the target enzyme \\n      DPP-4 and leading phytocompounds.

However, little research has been conducted on the\\n      acceptability of AI, particularly in mental health and crisis support, and how\\n      this may inform the development of responsible and responsive innovation in the\\n      area. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the level of support for the use of\\n      technology and automation, such as AI, in Lifeline\\'s crisis support services in\\n      Australia; the likelihood of service use if technology and automation were\\n      implemented; the impact of demographic characteristics on the level of support\\n      and likelihood of service use; and reasons for not using Lifeline\\'s crisis\\n      support services if technology and automation were implemented in the future.\\n      METHODS: A mixed methods study involving a computer-assisted telephone interview \\n      and a web-based survey was undertaken from 2019 to 2020 to explore expectations\\n      and anticipated outcomes of Lifeline\\'s crisis support services in a nationally\\n      representative community sample (n=1300) and a Lifeline help-seeker sample\\n      (n=553). Participants were aged between 18 and 93 years. Quantitative descriptive\\n      analysis, binary logistic regression models, and qualitative thematic analysis\\n      were conducted to address the research objectives. RESULTS: One-third of the\\n      community and help-seeker participants did not support the collection of\\n      information about service users through technology and automation (ie, via AI),\\n      and approximately half of the participants reported that they would be less\\n      likely to use the service if automation was introduced. Significant demographic\\n      differences were observed between the community and help-seeker samples. Of the\\n      demographics, only older age predicted being less likely to endorse technology\\n      and automation to tailor Lifeline\\'s crisis support service and use such services \\n      (odds ratio 1.48-1.66, 99% CI 1.03-2.38; P<.001 to P=.005). The most common\\n      reason for reluctance, reported by both samples, was that respondents wanted to\\n      speak to a real person, assuming that human counselors would be replaced by\\n      automated robots or machine services. CONCLUSIONS: Although Lifeline plans to\\n      always have a real person providing crisis support, help-seekers automatically\\n      fear this will not be the case if new technology and automation such as AI are\\n      introduced. Consequently, incorporating innovative use of technology to improve\\n      help-seeker outcomes in such services will require careful messaging and\\n      assurance that the human connection will continue.\\nCI  - (c)Jennifer S Ma, Megan O\\'Riordan, Kelly Mazzer, Philip J Batterham, Sally\\n      Bradford, Kairi Kolves, Nickolai Titov, Britt Klein, Debra J Rickwood.

METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Web of Science and PubMed were\\n      comprehensively searched from inception to August 20, 2021, for potential\\n      studies. RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven\\n      observational studies with 2723 patients met the inclusion criteria. The\\n      meta-analysis demonstrated that conventional therapy (CT) significantly increased\\n      hospital mortality compared with NM administration (RR = 1.25, p = 0.0007). In\\n      subgroup analyses, the in-hospital mortality of the NM group was significantly\\n      lower than that of the anticoagulant-free (NA) group (RR = 1.31, p = 0.002). The \\n      CT interventions markedly elevated the risk ratio of bleeding complications by\\n      45% (RR = 1.45, p = 0.010) compared with NM interventions. In another subgroup\\n      analysis, NM used exhibited a significantly lower risk of bleeding complications \\n      than those of the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) used (RR = 4.58, p =\\n      0.020). The filter lifespan was decreased significantly (MD = -10.59, p < 0.0001)\\n      in the NA groups compared with the NM groups. Due to the poor quality of the\\n      included RCTs, these results should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSION:\\n      Given the better survival outcomes, lower risk of bleeding, NM anticoagulation\\n      seems to be a safe and efficient approach for BPT patients and could yield a\\n      favorable filter lifespan. More multi-center RCTs with large samples are required\\n      for further validation of this study.\\nFAU - Lin, Yao\\nAU  - Lin Y\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-2726-2911\\nAD  - Jieyang Medical Research Center, Jieyang People\\'s Hospital, Jieyang, China.\\nFAU - Shao, Yiming\\nAU  - Shao Y\\nAD  - The Intensive Care Unit, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical\\n      University, Zhanjiang, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Yuchun\\nAU  - Liu Y\\nAD  - Jieyang Medical Research Center, Jieyang People\\'s Hospital, Jieyang, China.\\nFAU - Yang, Ruoxuan\\nAU  - Yang R\\nAD  - Jieyang Medical Research Center, Jieyang People\\'s Hospital, Jieyang, China.\\nFAU - Liao, Shuanglin\\nAU  - Liao S\\nAD  - The Intensive Care Unit, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical\\n      University, Zhanjiang, China.\\nFAU - Yang, Shuai\\nAU  - Yang S\\nAD  - The Intensive Care Unit, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical\\n      University, Zhanjiang, China.\\nFAU - Xu, Mingwei\\nAU  - Xu M\\nAD  - Jieyang Medical Research Center, Jieyang People\\'s Hospital, Jieyang, China.\\nFAU - He, Junbing\\nAU  - He J\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-6916-4770\\nAD  - Jieyang Medical Research Center, Jieyang People\\'s Hospital, Jieyang, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Ren Fail\\nJT  - Renal failure\\nJID - 8701128\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - COVID-19\\nOT  - Nafamostat mesilate\\nOT  - bleeding complication\\nOT  - blood purification\\nOT  - mortality\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 11:43\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 11:43 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/0886022X.2022.2105233 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Ren Fail. 2022 Dec;44(1):1263-1279. doi: 10.1080/0886022X.2022.2105233.\\n\\nPMID- 35930300\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1939-022X (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1939-0211 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - A Nutritional Blend Suppresses the Inflammatory Response from Bronchial\\n      Epithelial Cells Induced by SARS-CoV-2.\\nPG  - 1-15\\nLID - 10.1080/19390211.2022.2103607 [doi]\\nAB  - Even after virus elimination, numerous sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019\\n      (COVID-19) persist. Based on accumulating evidence, large amounts of\\n      proinflammatory cytokines are released to drive COVID-19 progression, severity,\\n      and mortality, and their levels remain elevated after the acute phase of\\n      COVID-19, playing a central role in the disease\\' sequelae. In this manner,\\n      bronchial epithelial cells are the first cells hyperactivated by severe acute\\n      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to massive cytokine\\n      release, triggering the hyperactivation of leukocytes and other cells, and\\n      mediating COVID-19 sequelae. Therefore, proinflammatory cytokine production is\\n      initiated by the host. This in vitro study tested the hypothesis that\\n      ImmuneRecov, a nutritional blend, inhibits the SARS-CoV-2-induced hyperactivation\\n      of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). BEAS-2B (5x10(4)/mL/well) cells\\n      were cocultivated with 1 ml of blood from a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient for 4 h, \\n      and the nutritional blend (1 microg/mL) was added in the first minute of\\n      coculture. After 4 h, the cells were recovered and used for analyses of\\n      cytotoxicity with the (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium\\n      bromide) (MTT) assay and the expression of the IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNAs.\\n      The supernatant was collected to measure cytokine levels. SARS-CoV-2 incubation\\n      resulted in increased levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 in BEAS-2B cells (p < 0.001).\\n      Treatment with the nutritional blend resulted in reduced levels of the\\n      proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6 (p < 0.001) and increased levels of\\n      the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (p < 0.001). Additionally, the nutritional\\n      blend reduced the expression of the IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNAs in\\n      SARS-CoV-2-stimulated cells and increased the expression of the IL-10 and\\n      IFN-gamma mRNAs. In conclusion, the nutritional blend exerts important\\n      anti-inflammatory effects on cells in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\\nFAU - Mateus-Silva, Jose Roberto\\nAU  - Mateus-Silva JR\\nAD  - GAP Biotech, Sao Jose dos Campos, SP, Brazil.\\nAD  - School of Medicine, Anhembi Morumbi University, Sao Jose dos Campos, SP, Brazil.\\nAD  - Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.\\nAD  - Post-graduate Program in Biomedical Engineering, Federal University of Sao Paulo,\\n      Sao Jose dos Campos, SP, Brazil.\\nFAU - Oliveira, Carlos Rocha\\nAU  - Oliveira CR\\nAD  - GAP Biotech, Sao Jose dos Campos, SP, Brazil.\\nAD  - School of Medicine, Anhembi Morumbi University, Sao Jose dos Campos, SP, Brazil.\\nAD  - Post-graduate Program in Biomedical Engineering, Federal University of Sao Paulo,\\n      Sao Jose dos Campos, SP, Brazil.\\nFAU - Brandao-Rangel, Maysa Alves Rodrigues\\nAU  - Brandao-Rangel MAR\\nAD  - Post-graduate Program in Sciences of Human Movement and Rehabilitation, Federal\\n      University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil.\\nFAU - Silva-Reis, Anamei\\nAU  - Silva-Reis A\\nAD  - Post-graduate Program in Sciences of Human Movement and Rehabilitation, Federal\\n      University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil.\\nFAU - Olimpio, Fabiana Regina da Silva\\nAU  - Olimpio FRDS\\nAD  - Postgraduate Program in Translational Medicine, Federal University of Sao Paulo, \\n      Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\\nFAU - Zamarioli, Lucas Dos Santos\\nAU  - Zamarioli LDS\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-4710-431X\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP,\\n      Brazil.\\nFAU - Aimbire, Flavio\\nAU  - Aimbire F\\nAD  - Postgraduate Program in Translational Medicine, Federal University of Sao Paulo, \\n      Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.\\nFAU - Vieira, Rodolfo P\\nAU  - Vieira RP\\nAD  - GAP Biotech, Sao Jose dos Campos, SP, Brazil.\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP,\\n      Brazil.\\nAD  - Brazilian Institute of Teaching and Research in Pulmonary and Exercise Immunology\\n      (IBEPIPE), Sao Jose dos Campos, SP, Brazil.\\nAD  - Post-graduation Program in Human Movement and Rehabilitation, Evangelical\\n      University of Goias (Unievangelica), Anapolis, GO, Brazil.\\nAD  - Post-graduation Program in Bioengineering, Universidade Brasil, Sao Paulo, SP,\\n      Brazil.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - J Diet Suppl\\nJT  - Journal of dietary supplements\\nJID - 101249830\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - COVID-19\\nOT  - SARS-CoV-2\\nOT  - cytokines\\nOT  - epithelium\\nOT  - inflammation\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 11:43\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 11:43 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/19390211.2022.2103607 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Diet Suppl. 2022 Aug 5:1-15. doi: 10.1080/19390211.2022.2103607.\\n\\nPMID- 35930298\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1525-6049 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0886-022X (Linking)\\nVI  - 44\\nIP  - 1\\nDP  - 2022 Dec\\nTI  - The value of postoperative HLA-DR expression and high mobility group box 1 level \\n      in predictive diagnosis of sepsis in percutaneous nephrolithotomy surgery.\\nPG  - 1338-1344\\nLID - 10.1080/0886022X.2022.2107541 [doi]\\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the value of postoperative human leukocyte antigen-DR\\n      (HLA-DR) expression and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) level in predictive\\n      diagnosis of postoperative sepsis for patients with percutaneous nephrolithotomy \\n      (PCNL) surgery. METHODS: The present prospective observational study included 387\\n      patients with renal calculus who received PCNL surgery from January 2017 to\\n      October 2020 in our hospital. After exclusion criteria, 33 patients with sepsis\\n      and 78 patients with no sepsis remained. All patients received PCNL surgery.\\n      Sepsis definition is according to the third international consensus definitions\\n      for sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3). The data of the HMGB1, c-reactive protein\\n      (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT) and HLA-DR expression were\\n      collected within admission and 24 h and 72 h after surgery. Postoperative HMGB1\\n      levels and HLA-DR expression at 24 h and 72 h were respectively compared between \\n      the two groups using t test.

RESULTS: The positive rate of urine culture and the time of\\n      hospitalization time in patients with sepsis were significantly higher than those\\n      in patients with no sepsis. Sepsis group had higher levels of HMGB1 at post-24 h \\n      ((93.07 +/- 11.37) ng/mL vs (75.41 +/- 4.85) ng/mL), p < 0.05) and 72 h ((96.58\\n      +/- 12.12) ng/mL vs (81.16 +/- 8.86) ng/mL), p < 0.05) than nosepsis group.\\n      Meanwhile, sepsis group had lower expression of HLA-DR at post-24 h ((50.01 +/-\\n      7.42) % vs (69.32 +/- 10.58) %), p < 0.05) and 72 h ((54.85 +/- 9.45) % vs (69.98\\n      +/- 11.00) %), p < 0.05) than non-sepsis group. ROC analysis showed that the\\n      HLA-DR expression at postoperative 24 h had highest predictive value in the\\n      diagnosis of sepsis, the AUC of HLA-DR was 0.934, cutoff value 56.19%, with\\n      sensitivity 89.7%, specificity 81.8%.

This study aimed to compare survival outcomes between salvage\\n      surgery and immunotherapy in patients with recurrent advanced HNSCC. METHODS:\\n      Patients with advanced stage (stage III or IV) recurrent HNSCC following\\n      treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy were included.

RESULTS: Two-year overall survival after salvage surgery was\\n      68.6% and after immunotherapy patients was 24.6%. Multivariate logistic\\n      regression showed that salvage surgery was associated with improved survival\\n      without statistical significance (hazard ratio [HR] 0.12, p = 0.25). Subgroup\\n      analysis of patients with oral cavity/oropharyngeal cancer noted improved\\n      survival with salvage surgery over immunotherapy (HR 0.006, p = 0.01) and\\n      decreased survival with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 5 (HR 6.4, p =\\n      0.02).

In Asia,\\n      most HCC is caused by chronic hepatitis B infection. Whether hepatitis B virus\\n      DNA (HBV DNA) is a risk factor for HCC recurrence after OLT is not clear.\\n      PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we classified patients into\\n      groups of detectable and undetectable HBV DNA, non-HCC recurrence, and recurrence\\n      and performed analyses on differed characteristics between groups and risk\\n      factors for HCC recurrence after OLT. RESULTS: Among patients who underwent OLT\\n      for HCC, 117 were secondary to CHB infection. CHB was not a risk, but advanced\\n      tumour characteristics were risk factor for HCC recurrence. In patients with\\n      CHB-HCC, 24 (20.5%) of 117 patients had HCC recurrence. Compared to patients with\\n      HBV DNA undetectable (n = 75), patients with detectable HBV DNA (n = 42) had\\n      higher AFP concentration (p < .001), higher proportion of macrovascular invasion \\n      (p = .014), greater tumour diameter (p < .001), poorer TNM stage (p = .017), and \\n      higher proportion of extended OLT criteria (p = .011) and HCC recurrence (p =\\n      .036). Preoperative HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL was an independent risk factor for HCC\\n      recurrence (OR = 8.35, 95% CI 1.40, 50.00, p = .020). HBV DNA detectable was not \\n      a risk for HCC-related death. CONCLUSION: Individuals with preoperative\\n      undetectable HBV DNA had advanced tumour characteristics and a higher proportion \\n      of HCC recurrence. Antiviral treatment for HCC should be performed, and HBV DNA\\n      undetectable should be obtained before OLT. But for an urgent OLT, preoperative\\n      detectable HBV DNA may not affect long-term survival.KEY MESSAGESPatients with\\n      HBV DNA detectable had advanced tumour characteristics, a higher proportion of\\n      extended OLT criteria, and HCC-recurrence.HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL was a risk factor\\n      for HCC recurrence.HBV DNA detectable was not a risk for HCC related death;\\n      extended OLT criteria affected long-term survival.\\nFAU - Zhang, Dali\\nAU  - Zhang D\\nAD  - Senior Department of Hepatology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People\\'s\\n      Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Feng, Danni\\nAU  - Feng D\\nAD  - Senior Department of Hepatology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People\\'s\\n      Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Ren, Minjuan\\nAU  - Ren M\\nAD  - Senior Department of Hepatology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People\\'s\\n      Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Bai, Ying\\nAU  - Bai Y\\nAD  - Senior Department of Hepatology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People\\'s\\n      Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Zhenwen\\nAU  - Liu Z\\nAD  - Senior Department of Hepatology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People\\'s\\n      Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Hongbo\\nAU  - Wang H\\nAD  - Senior Department of Hepatology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese People\\'s\\n      Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Ann Med\\nJT  - Annals of medicine\\nJID - 8906388\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Liver transplantation\\nOT  - hepatitis B virus DNA\\nOT  - hepatocellular carcinoma\\nOT  - long-term survival\\nOT  - recurrence\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 11:42\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 11:42 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/07853890.2022.2107233 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Ann Med. 2022 Dec;54(1):2213-2221. doi: 10.1080/07853890.2022.2107233.\\n\\nPMID- 35930289\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1460-2202 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0271-3683 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Tear Film miRNAs and their Association with Human Dry Eye Disease.\\nPG  - 1-30\\nLID - 10.1080/02713683.2022.2110597 [doi]\\nAB  - PURPOSE: miRNAs can regulate inflammatory pathways.

CONCLUSION:\\n      This study determined that EVs are present in the tear film and that tear EVs\\n      contain miRNAs that may be associated with DED inflammatory pathways.\\nFAU - Pucker, Andrew D\\nAU  - Pucker AD\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-4032-2744\\nAD  - University of Alabama at Birmingham, School of Optometry, Department of Optometry\\n      and Vision Science.\\nFAU - Ngo, William\\nAU  - Ngo W\\nAD  - University of Alabama at Birmingham, School of Optometry, Department of Optometry\\n      and Vision Science.\\nFAU - Postnikoff, Cameron K\\nAU  - Postnikoff CK\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-6512-5363\\nAD  - University of Alabama at Birmingham, School of Optometry, Department of Optometry\\n      and Vision Science.\\nFAU - Fortinberry, Henry\\nAU  - Fortinberry H\\nAD  - University of Alabama at Birmingham, School of Optometry, Department of Optometry\\n      and Vision Science.\\nFAU - Nichols, Jason J\\nAU  - Nichols JJ\\nAD  - University of Alabama at Birmingham, School of Optometry, Department of Optometry\\n      and Vision Science.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Curr Eye Res\\nJT  - Current eye research\\nJID - 8104312\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Dry Eye Disease\\nOT  - Extracellular Vesicles\\nOT  - RNA-Seq\\nOT  - Tears\\nOT  - miRNA\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 11:34\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 11:34 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/02713683.2022.2110597 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Curr Eye Res. 2022 Aug 5:1-30. doi: 10.1080/02713683.2022.2110597.\\n\\nPMID- 35930282\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2574-3805 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2574-3805 (Linking)\\nVI  - 5\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 1\\nTI  - Longitudinal Clinical and Cognitive Changes Along the Alzheimer Disease Continuum\\n      in Down Syndrome.\\nPG  - e2225573\\nLID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25573 [doi]\\nAB  - Importance: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the main medical problem in adults with\\n      Down syndrome (DS). However, the associations of age, intellectual disability\\n      (ID), and clinical status with progression and longitudinal cognitive decline\\n      have not been established. Objective: To examine clinical progression along the\\n      AD continuum and its related cognitive decline and to explore the presence of\\n      practice effects and floor effects with repeated assessments. Design, Setting,\\n      and Participants: This is a single-center cohort study of adults (aged >18 years)\\n      with DS with different ID levels and at least 6 months of follow-up between\\n      November 2012 and December 2021. The data are from a population-based health plan\\n      designed to screen for AD in adults with DS in Catalonia, Spain. Individuals were\\n      classified as being asymptomatic, having prodromal AD, or having AD dementia.\\n      Exposures: Neurological and neuropsychological assessments. Main Outcomes and\\n      Measures: The main outcome was clinical change along the AD continuum. Cognitive \\n      decline was measured by the Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults With\\n      Down Syndrome and the modified Cued Recall Test. Results: A total of 632 adults\\n      with DS (mean [SD] age, 42.6 [11.4] years; 292 women [46.2%]) with 2847\\n      evaluations (mean [SD] follow-up, 28.8 [18.7] months) were assessed. At baseline,\\n      there were 436 asymptomatic individuals, 69 patients with prodromal AD, and 127\\n      with AD dementia. After 5 years of follow-up, 17.1% (95% CI, 12.5%-21.5%) of\\n      asymptomatic individuals progressed to symptomatic AD in an age-dependent manner \\n      (0.6% [95% CI, 0%-1.8%] for age <40 years; 21.1% [95% CI, 8.0%-32.5%] for age\\n      40-44 years; 41.4% [95% CI, 23.1%-55.3%] for age 45-49 years; 57.5% [95% CI,\\n      38.2%-70.8%] for age >/=50 years; P < .001), and 94.1% (95% CI, 84.6%-98.0%) of\\n      patients with prodromal AD progressed to dementia with no age dependency.\\n      Cognitive decline in the older individuals was most common among those who\\n      progressed to symptomatic AD and symptomatic individuals themselves. Importantly,\\n      individuals with mild and moderate ID had no differences in longitudinal\\n      cognitive decline despite having different performance at baseline. This study\\n      also found practice and floor effects, which obscured the assessment of\\n      longitudinal cognitive decline. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found an\\n      association between the development of symptomatic AD and a high risk of\\n      progressive cognitive decline among patients with DS. These results support the\\n      need for population health plans to screen for AD-related cognitive decline from \\n      the fourth decade of life and provide important longitudinal data to inform\\n      clinical trials in adults with DS to prevent AD.\\nFAU -

The role of\\n      the HEPC-to-ferritin (FER) ratio and its components in iron metabolism along with\\n      their diagnostic cutoff values, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in beta-TM\\n      patients with iron overload, were examined in this study. This was a 1:1\\n      case-control study with 120 participants, ages ranging from 2 to 30 years of both\\n      sexes, who were assigned into two groups: 60 beta-TM patients with iron overload,\\n      and a control group, comprising 60 healthy individuals matched by gender and age.\\n      In the present study, we found slightly elevated serum HEPC concentration (21.9\\n      ng/mL) compared to the controls (9.9 ng/mL), which was not statistically\\n      significant (p =0.1), and the median HEPC-to-FER ratio of the cases was\\n      significantly lower than the controls, with the median case-control difference of\\n      (-0.366; p < 0.001). Our results revealed a statistically significant impact (p <\\n      0.001) of mean age on the serum HEPC level with the inverse linear correlation of\\n      (-0.487, p < 0.001). The area under the curve of the HEPC-to-FER ratio was 0.999 \\n      and the optimum cutoff value was 0.046 ng/mL (p < 0.001) with 100.0% sensitivity \\n      and 98.3% specificity. In conclusion, we found that serum HEPC-to-FER ratio, with\\n      an accuracy of 99.2%, may serve as an excellent index for the diagnosis of iron\\n      overload in beta-TM patients differentiating them from nonthalassemic controls.\\nFAU - Zaman, Burhan A\\nAU  - Zaman BA\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-6480-7693\\nAD  - Department of Basic Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Duhok, Duhok\\n      City, Iraq.\\nFAU - Ibrahim, Shereen A\\nAU  - Ibrahim SA\\nAD  - Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of\\n      Duhok, Duhok City, Iraq.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Hemoglobin\\nJT  - Hemoglobin\\nJID - 7705865\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - ferritin (FER)\\nOT  - hepcidin (HEPC)\\nOT  - iron overload\\nOT  - beta-Thalassemia major (beta-TM)\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 11:33\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 11:33 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/03630269.2022.2083969 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Hemoglobin. 2022 Aug 5:1-8. doi: 10.1080/03630269.2022.2083969.\\n\\nPMID- 35930273\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1557-8518 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1540-4196 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Impact of Prediabetes on Cardiac Function Among Primary Care Patients.\\nLID - 10.1089/met.2021.0006 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Prediabetes is a novel risk factor recently associated with changes\\n      in the left ventricle. Our aim is to determine if prediabetes is associated with \\n      heart failure (HF) and structural heart disease. Methods: We conducted a\\n      cross-sectional study and performed screening echocardiograms to consecutive\\n      primary care patients. We calculated the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) within 3 months\\n      of the echocardiogram and classified patients as having normal glucose, low-risk \\n      or high-risk prediabetes or diabetes. Our primary outcome was HF defined as an\\n      ejection fraction (EF) <50% and HF with preserved EF. Our secondary outcome was\\n      structural heart disease defined as having either a large atrium, left\\n      ventricular hypertrophy, or low EF. Results: We included 15,056 patients who\\n      underwent a screening echocardiogram and had a recorded HbA1c. Only 2794 patients\\n      had a normal blood glucose, 4201 had low-risk prediabetes, 2499 had high-risk\\n      prediabetes, and the remainder had diabetes. The adjusted odds ratio (ORs) of HF \\n      for low-risk prediabetes, high-risk prediabetes and diabetes were 1.38\\n      [confidence interval (95% CI) 1.07-1.78] (P = 0.01), 1.47 (95% CI 1.05-2.01) (P =\\n      0.01), and 1.60 (95% CI 1.16-2.01) (P < 0.01), respectively, when compared with\\n      normoglycemic patients. The adjusted OR of HF with preserved EF for low- and\\n      high-risk prediabetes and diabetes were 1.17 (95% CI 0.86-1.60) (P = 0.30), 1.60 \\n      (95% CI 1.15-2.21) (P < 0.01), and 1.63 (95% CI 1.24-2.13) (P < 0.01),\\n      respectively, when compared with normoglycemic patients.

Methods: Seventeen patients (five adults, 12 children) with\\n      genetically confirmed CNGA3- or CNGB3-associated ACHM underwent ocular\\n      examination and OCT over a follow-up period of between 2 and 9.33 years (mean =\\n      5.7 years). Foveal tomograms were qualitatively graded and were segmented for\\n      quantitative analysis: central macular thickness (CMt), outer nuclear layer\\n      thickness (ONLt), and size of the foveal hyporeflective zone (vertical HRZ\\n      thickness: HRZt and horizontal HRZ width: HRZw) were measured. Data were analyzed\\n      using linear mixed regression models. Both age and visit were included into the\\n      models, to explore the possibility that the rate of disease progression depends\\n      on patient age. Results: Fifteen of 17 patients (88%) showed longitudinal changes\\n      in retinal structure over the follow-up period. The most common patterns of\\n      progression was development of ellipsoid zone (EZ) disruption and HRZ. There was \\n      a significant increase in HRZt (P = 0.01) and HRZw (P = 0.001) between visits and\\n      no significant change in CMt and ONLt.

Recipient vein selection for anastomosis is important to avoid\\n      venous congestion and thrombosis. Although deep or superficial venous system can \\n      be used as a recipient vein site, there is a lack of consensus on which system\\n      would be superior to avoid postoperative complications. This systematic review\\n      and meta-analysis aimed to assess the differences in outcomes between deep and\\n      superficial vein anastomosis for lower-extremity free flap reconstruction.\\n      METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library medical\\n      databases were systematically searched from inception to April 2022, in\\n      accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and\\n      Meta-analyses guidelines. A comparative meta-analysis was conducted on studies of\\n      deep and superficial venous system anastomosis outcomes, comprising vascular\\n      thrombosis, reoperation, complete flap necrosis, and any flap necrosis. The\\n      fixed-effects meta-analysis model was used when low heterogeneity (I(2) < 50%)\\n      was present. RESULTS: Six studies with 789 flaps were included in the analysis\\n      and qualitative and quantitative syntheses. The rate of vascular thrombosis (8.2%\\n      vs. 15.1%; p = .005) was significantly lower for flaps involving deep vein\\n      anastomosis than for those involving superficial vein anastomosis. The rate of\\n      reoperation after deep vein anastomosis was lower than that after superficial\\n      vein anastomosis, with no statistically significant difference (9.0% vs. 14.7%; p\\n      = .06). There were no significant differences in the rates of complete (2.5% vs. \\n      2.0%; p = .90) or any flap necrosis (7.0% vs. 9.8%; p = .20). CONCLUSION: Deep\\n      vein anastomosis might be recommended for avoiding vascular thrombosis.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\\nFAU - Shimbo, Keisuke\\nAU  - Shimbo K\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0761-4147\\nAD  - Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital,\\n      Hiroshima, Japan.\\nFAU - Kawamoto, Haruka\\nAU  - Kawamoto H\\nAD  - Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital,\\n      Hiroshima, Japan.\\nFAU - Koshima, Isao\\nAU  - Koshima I\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4588-8157\\nAD  - Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Hiroshima University Hospital, \\n      Hiroshima, Japan.\\nAD  - International Center for Lymphedema, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima,\\n      Japan.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Review\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Microsurgery\\nJT  - Microsurgery\\nJID - 8309230\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 11:24\\nPHST- 2022/06/11 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/02/21 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/22 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 11:24 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1002/micr.30946 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Microsurgery. 2022 Aug 5. doi: 10.1002/micr.30946.\\n\\nPMID- 35930259\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1538-9235 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1040-5488 (Linking)\\nVI  - 99\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 1\\nTI  - The Value of Static Perimetry in the Diagnosis and Follow-up of Negative\\n      Dysphotopsia.\\nPG  - 645-651\\nLID - 10.1097/OPX.0000000000001918 [doi]\\nAB  - SIGNIFICANCE: There is a clinical need for a quantitative test to objectively\\n      diagnose negative dysphotopsia, especially because the diagnosis is generally\\n      assessed using patients\\' subjective descriptions. In the search of a clinical\\n      test to objectify the shadow experienced in negative dysphotopsia, this study\\n      excludes static perimetry as suitable evaluation method. PURPOSE: This study\\n      aimed to evaluate the value of static perimetry in the objective assessment and\\n      follow-up of negative dysphotopsia. METHODS: Peripheral 60-4 full-threshold\\n      visual field tests were performed in 27 patients with negative dysphotopsia and\\n      33 pseudophakic controls. In addition, 11 patients with negative dysphotopsia\\n      repeated the test after an intraocular lens exchange. Both the total peripheral\\n      visual field and the averaged peripheral visual field from 50 to 60 degrees\\n      eccentricity were compared between patients and controls, and pre-operatively and\\n      post-operatively in patients who had an intraocular lens exchange. RESULTS: The\\n      peripheral visual fields from 30 to 60 degrees did not show significant\\n      differences between patients with negative dysphotopsia and pseudophakic\\n      controls. Analysis of the peripheral visual field from 50 to 60 degrees showed a \\n      median [Q1, Q3] of 20.0 [17.1, 22.5] dB in the negative dysphotopsia group\\n      compared with 20.1 [15.5, 21.3] dB in the control group (P = .43). Although 82%\\n      of patients treated with an intraocular lens exchange subjectively reported\\n      improvement of their negative dysphotopsia complaints post-operatively, there\\n      were no significant differences in their total peripheral visual field or\\n      averaged peripheral visual field from 50 to 60 degrees (P = .92). CONCLUSIONS:\\n      Full-threshold static perimetry with a Goldmann size III stimulus up to 60\\n      degrees eccentricity does not show significant differences between patients with \\n      negative dysphotopsia and pseudophakic controls or between measurements before\\n      and after intraocular lens exchange. Therefore, this type of static perimetry\\n      cannot be used as a quantitative objective test for diagnosis or follow-up of\\n      patients with negative dysphotopsia.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

The ELISA results revealed a significantly\\n      higher concentration of PGK2 and ACR in the NOA patients with successful sperm\\n      retrieval (NOA+) in comparison to NOA patients with failed sperm retrieval (NOA-)\\n      group (p = 0.0001 in both cases). For the first time, the data from this study\\n      suggests that a seminal PGK2 concentration of 136.3 pg/ml and ACR concentration\\n      of 21.75 mIU/ml can be used as cut-off values for the prediction of micro-TESE\\n      outcomes in NOA patients. These findings may be useful to avoid unnecessary\\n      micro-TESE operations. Overall, the seminal levels of the PGK2 and ACR proteins\\n      may be useful in predicting sperm retrieval success by micro-TESE in NOA\\n      patients.\\nFAU - Ghanami Gashti, Nasrin\\nAU  - Ghanami Gashti N\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-0060-3955\\nAD  - Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences,\\n      Tehran, Iran.\\nAD  - Reproductive Health Research Center, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology,\\n      Al-Zahra Hospital, School of Medicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences,\\n      Rasht, Iran.\\nFAU - Sadighi Gilani, Mohammad Ali\\nAU  - Sadighi Gilani MA\\nAD  - Department of Andrology, Reproductive Biomedicine Research Center, Royan\\n      Institute for Reproductive Biomedicine, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.\\nAD  - Department of Urology, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, \\n      Tehran, Iran.\\nFAU - Kabodmehri, Roya\\nAU  - Kabodmehri R\\nAD  - Reproductive Health Research Center, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology,\\n      Al-Zahra Hospital, School of Medicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences,\\n      Rasht, Iran.\\nFAU - Nikmahzar, Aghbibi\\nAU  - Nikmahzar A\\nAD  - Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences,\\n      Tehran, Iran.\\nFAU - Salem, Maryam\\nAU  - Salem M\\nAD  - Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences,\\n      Tehran, Iran.\\nFAU - Abbasi, Mehdi\\nAU  - Abbasi M\\nAD  - Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences,\\n      Tehran, Iran.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Hum Fertil (Camb)\\nJT  - Human fertility (Cambridge, England)\\nJID - 100888143\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - ACR\\nOT  - PGK2\\nOT  - Seminal plasma\\nOT  - micro-TESE\\nOT  - non-obstructive azoospermia\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 11:23\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 11:23 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/14647273.2022.2104136 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Hum Fertil (Camb). 2022 Aug 5:1-7. doi: 10.1080/14647273.2022.2104136.\\n\\nPMID- 35930248\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1557-8674 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1096-2964 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Silver-Based Dressings in the Prevention of the Incisional Surgical Site\\n      Infection: A Prospective Multicenter Observational Controlled Trial.\\nLID - 10.1089/sur.2022.084 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: A new silver-based dressing has been designed to reduce surgical\\n      sited infections.

White Blood Cell Trends during\\n      Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia.\\nLID - 10.1089/sur.2022.094 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) continues to plague patients in\\n      intensive care units (ICUs) throughout the world. Persistent leukocytosis despite\\n      antibiotic treatment for VAP can have many etiologies including normal\\n      inflammatory response, inadequate VAP antimicrobial therapy, and the presence of \\n      additional infectious diagnoses. Hypothesis: Surgical patients with VAP and a\\n      second infectious source have a different white blood cell count (WBC) trend than\\n      patients with VAP alone. Patients and Methods: Retrospective, single-center study\\n      of surgical ICU patients diagnosed with VAP (>10(4) CFU/mL on semi-quantitative\\n      culture) between January 2019 and June 2020. Chart review identified additional\\n      infections diagnosed during VAP treatment. White blood cell count values were\\n      compared between patients treated for VAP alone (VAP-alone) and those with\\n      additional infections (VAP-plus) using a Wilcoxon test. Univariable analysis\\n      compared admission type, surgeries, and steroid use between cohorts. Results:\\n      Eighty-eight VAPs were included for analysis; 61 (69%) were VAP-alone and 27\\n      (31%) VAP-plus. Average age was 47.1 +/- 16.7 years, 78% were male, and 93% were \\n      trauma admissions. Median hospital day of VAP diagnosis was six (interquartile\\n      range [IQR], 4-10). Nearly all patients (99%) were started on initial antibiotic \\n      agents to which the VAP organism was sensitive.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A\\n      cross-sectional study was conducted among supermarkets cashiers using\\n      self-administered. Data were analysed using chi(2) and logistic regression\\n      models. Statistical significance was assumed at p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 174\\n      supermarkets cashiers participated in this study majority of whom were females\\n      (72%). The prevalence of lower back pain was 69%, upper back pain 53% and neck\\n      pain 37%. Increasing age was associated with neck 95% CI [1.43-5.15] and upper\\n      back 95% CI [1.43-3.60] pain. Cashiers working at low work surface and\\n      overreaching for items were 19 and 11 times more likely to report neck 95% CI\\n      [1.7-255.9] and lower back 95% CI [1.84-62.1] pain, respectively. Almost 6% of\\n      cashiers who reported lower back pain reported considering changing jobs due to\\n      pain. CONCLUSIONS: More than two-thirds, half and about two-fifths of supermarket\\n      cashiers reported lower back, upper back and neck pain, respectively.

This study examined BCS with\\n      avoidance coping and their engagement in a FoR eHealth intervention (FoRtitude). \\n      METHODS: BCS (N = 196) with elevated FoR participated in FoRtitude.\\n      Patient-reported measures assessed avoidance coping with FoR and baseline\\n      emotional and behavioral health. Intervention engagement was measured\\n      quantitatively (e.g., website logins, telecoaching attendance) and qualitatively \\n      (i.e., telecoaching notes). RESULTS: 38 BCS (19%) endorsed avoidance coping,\\n      which was associated with more severe post-traumatic anxiety-related symptoms and\\n      worse global mental health (ps < .05), but not anxiety (p = .19), depression (p =\\n      .11), physical health (p = .12), alcohol consumption (p = .85), or physical\\n      activity (p = .39). Avoidance coping was not associated with engagement levels\\n      (ps > .05) but did characterize engagement-related motivators and barriers.\\n      CONCLUSIONS: Avoidance coping was not a barrier to FoRtitude engagement. eHealth \\n      delivery is a promising modality for engaging survivors with avoidance coping in \\n      FoR interventions.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

Whether the optimal treatment for IS-CTO is\\n      angioplasty with paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCBs) or repeat stenting with\\n      drug-eluting stents (DESs) is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the long-term\\n      clinical outcome of PCB angioplasty and DES repeat stenting for DES IS-CTO.\\n      METHODS: We retrospectively included patients with DES IS-CTO who underwent\\n      successful PCB angioplasty or DES repeat stenting from January 2016 to December\\n      2019. The primary endpoints were major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including \\n      cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization (TLR). \\n      Cox proportional hazards model was performed to compare the risk of MACEs between\\n      PCB angioplasty and DES repeat stenting, and to further explore the prognostic\\n      factors of patients with DES IS-CTO. RESULTS: A total of 214 patients with DES\\n      IS-CTO were enrolled: 78 patients (36.4%) treated with PCB and 136 patients\\n      (63.6%) treated with DES respectively. The median follow-up was 1160 days, and\\n      MACEs were observed in 28.2% of patients with PCB angioplasty versus 26.5% of\\n      patients with DES repeat stenting (P = 0.784), mainly driven by TLR (21.8% vs.\\n      19.9%, P = 0.735). There was no significant difference in the risk of MACEs\\n      between the PCB group and the DES group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.25, 95% confidence\\n      interval [CI] 0.64-2.46, P = 0.512). Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that\\n      chronic kidney disease and >/= 3 stent layers in the lesion were independent\\n      predictors of MACEs, while switching to another antiproliferative drug was an\\n      independent protective factor (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PCB angioplasty was an\\n      effective alternative treatment strategy for DES IS-CTO, which had similar\\n      long-term outcomes to DES repeat stenting in contemporary practice, but both were\\n      accompanied by a high rate of long-term MACEs. Improving the poor prognosis of\\n      patients with DES IS-CTO remains a challenge.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

T cell activation receptor CD69\\n      binds to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), inducing the expression of\\n      anti-inflammatory NR4A nuclear receptors and modulating inflammation in\\n      atherosclerosis. To understand the downstream T cell responses triggered by the\\n      CD69-oxLDL binding, we incubated CD69-expressing Jurkat T cells with oxLDL. RNA\\n      sequencing revealed a differential gene expression profile dependent on the\\n      presence of CD69 and the degree of LDL oxidation. CD69-oxLDL binding induced the \\n      expression of NR4A receptors (NR4A1 and NR4A3), but also of PD-1. These results\\n      were confirmed using oxLDL and a monoclonal antibody against CD69 in\\n      CD69-expressing Jurkat and primary CD4 + lymphocytes. CD69-mediated induction of \\n      PD-1 and NR4A3 was dependent on NFAT activation. Silencing NR4A3 slightly\\n      increased PD-1 levels, suggesting a potential regulation of PD-1 by this\\n      receptor. Moreover, expression of PD-1, CD69 and NR4A3 was increased in human\\n      arteries with chronic inflammation compared to healthy controls, with a strong\\n      correlation between PD-1 and CD69 mRNA expression (r = 0.655 P < 0.0001).\\n      Moreover, PD-1 was expressed in areas enriched in CD3 infiltrating T cells. Our\\n      results underscore a novel mechanism of PD-1 induction independent of TCR\\n      signalling that might contribute to the role of CD69 in the modulation of\\n      inflammation and vascular remodelling in cardiovascular diseases.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

Continuous positive \\n      airway pressure (CPAP) is a recommended treatment for OSA but its effectiveness\\n      on cognitive improvement is uncertain, a finding which may be biased by various\\n      durations and adherence to treatment with CPAP. In a meta-analysis assessing\\n      high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we estimated whether or not\\n      CPAP benefits cognition in patients with OSA. METHODS: PRISMA criteria were\\n      followed in the performance of this meta-analysis. The weighted mean difference\\n      (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of six neuropsychological scores covering \\n      eight cognitive domains were used to evaluate the benefit between CPAP and\\n      non-CPAP interventions. Subgroups of different therapeutic durations and\\n      adherence, which were divided into short-term (< 8 weeks) and long-term (>/= 12\\n      weeks) durations, and poor (nighttime < 4 h/night) and good (nighttime >/= 4\\n      h/night) adherence were also analyzed. RESULTS: Among 16 RCTs, 1529 participants \\n      with OSA were included. Comparing the CPAP group and the control group for all\\n      treatment durations and adherence, a mild improvement for digit span forward\\n      which reflected short-term memory was observed (WMD[95%CI] = 0.67[0.03,1.31], p =\\n      0.04). Trail making test-part B, which reflected executive function was improved \\n      for participants with OSA who had good adherence to CPAP (WMD[95%CI] = - 6.24[-\\n      12.60,0.12], p = 0.05). Patients with OSA who received short-term CPAP treatment \\n      (WMD[95%CI] = - 7.20[- 12.57, - 1.82], p = 0.009) had a significant improvement\\n      in executive function when compared with controls. There was no statistical\\n      difference for all scales between long-term (>/= 12 weeks) CPAP treatment group\\n      and control group. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of CPAP on cognitive improvement\\n      in patients with OSA is limited, although good adherence to CPAP can mildly\\n      benefit executive function with short-term effectiveness.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

It is\\n      unknown whether HGS is prognostically relevant in COVID-19. We evaluated the\\n      ability of HGS to predict clinical outcomes in people with COVID-19-related\\n      pneumonia. 118 patients (66% men, 63 +/- 12 years), consecutively hospitalized to\\n      the \"Santa Maria\" Terni University Hospital for COVID-19-related pneumonia and\\n      respiratory failure, underwent HGS measurement (Jamar hand-dynamometer) at ward\\n      admission. HGS was normalized to weight(2/3) (nHGS) The main end-point was the\\n      first occurrence of death and/or endotracheal intubation at 14 days. Twenty-two\\n      patients reached the main end-point. In the Kaplan-Meyer analysis, the Log rank\\n      test showed significant differences between subjects with lower than mean HGS\\n      normalized to weight(2/3) (nHGS) (< 1.32 kg/Kg(2/3)) vs subjects with higher than\\n      mean nHGS. (p = 0.03). In a Cox-proportional hazard model, nHGS inversely\\n      predicted the main end-point (hazard ratio, HR = 1.99 each 0.5 kg/Kg(2/3)\\n      decrease, p = 0.03), independently from age, sex, body mass index, ratio of\\n      partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2\\n      ratio), hypertension, diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate and history \\n      of previous cardiovascular cardiovascular disease. These two latter also showed\\n      independent association with the main end-point (HR 1.30, p = 0.03 and 3.89, p < \\n      0.01, respectively). In conclusion, nHGS measured at hospital admission,\\n      independently and inversely predicts the risk of poor outcomes in people with\\n      COVID-19-related pneumonia. The evaluation of HGS may be useful in early\\n      stratifying the risk of adverse prognosis in COVID-19.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

INTRODUCTION: Brain fog has been described up to 1 year after SARS-CoV-2\\n      infection, notwithstanding the underlying mechanisms are still poorly\\n      investigated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of cognitive\\n      complaints at 1-year follow-up and to identify the factors related to persistent \\n      brain fog in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Out of 246 COVID patients, hospitalized \\n      from March 1st to May 31st, a sample of 137 patients accepted to be evaluated at \\n      1 year from discharge, through a full clinical, neurological, and psychological\\n      examination, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), impact of event \\n      scale-revised (IES-R), Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS), Zung self-rating \\n      anxiety scale (SAS), and fatigue severity scale (FSS). Subjects with prior\\n      cognitive impairment and/or psychiatric disorders were excluded. RESULTS:\\n      Patients with cognitive disorders exhibited lower MoCA score (22.9 +/- 4.3 vs.\\n      26.3 +/- 3.1, p = 0.002) and higher IES-R score (33.7 +/- 18.5 vs. 26.4 +/- 16.3,\\n      p = 0.050), SDS score (40.9 +/- 6.5 vs. 35.5 +/- 8.6, p = 0.004), and fatigue\\n      severity scale score (33.6 +/- 16.1 vs. 23.7 +/- 12.5, p = 0.001), compared to\\n      patients without cognitive complaints. Logistic regression showed a significant\\n      correlation between brain fog and the self-rating depression scale values (p =\\n      0.020), adjusted for age (p = 0.445), sex (p = 0.178), premorbid Cumulative\\n      Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) (p = 0.288), COVID-19 severity (BCRSS) (p = 0.964),\\n      education level (p = 0.784) and MoCA score (p = 0.909).

However, population-based\\n      studies provide contrasting evidence, resulting in a poor understanding of the\\n      effect of proteins from specific foods on kidney health. METHODS: We analyzed the\\n      effect of total daily protein intake (TDPI) and source-specific daily protein\\n      intake (DPI) on fasting serum creatinine (SCr) and estimated glomerular\\n      filtration rate (eGFR) in the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) \\n      cross-sectional study (n = 5889), using the GA(2)LEN food frequency questionnaire\\n      for TDPI and DPI estimation. We fitted multivariable adjusted mixed models of SCr\\n      and eGFR on TDPI and DPI quartiles (Q1-Q4) in the overall sample, and after\\n      removing individuals with known hypertension, diabetes or chronic kidney disease \\n      (CKD). RESULTS: Higher TDPI as well as DPI from overall animal sources, fish, and\\n      poultry, were associated with higher SCr (trend test p, ptrend < 0.01), with\\n      larger effect after excluding individuals with known hypertension, diabetes or\\n      CKD. The eGFR was lower at higher TDPI (Q4 vs Q1: - 1.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2); 95% CI \\n      - 2.5, - 0.7; ptrend = 3e-4) and DPI from fish (Q4 vs Q1: - 2.1 ml/min/1.73 m(2);\\n      95% CI - 2.9, - 1.20; ptrend = 4.3e-6), overall animal source (Q4 vs Q1: - 1.6\\n      ml/min/1.73 m(2); 95% CI -2.5, - 0.8), processed meat (Q4 vs Q1: - 1.4\\n      ml/min/1.73 m(2); ptrend = 0.027), red meat, offal and processed meat (Q4 vs Q1: \\n      - 1.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2); ptrend = 0.015) and poultry (Q4 vs Q1: - 0.9 ml/min/1.73 \\n      m(2); ptrend = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: TDPI and DPI from specific animal sources\\n      were positively associated with SCr and negatively associated with eGFR. Lacking \\n      an alternative marker of kidney function, confounding involving muscle mass\\n      metabolism cannot be fully excluded.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

However, there are \\n      few keratinases that combine the high activity, thermal stability, and organic\\n      solvent tolerance required for industrialization. This paper reported an\\n      efficient feather-degrading Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4-3 isolated from\\n      slaughterhouses. After 48 h of fermentation by P. aeruginosa 4-3 in a feather\\n      medium at 40 degrees C, pH 8.0, keratinase was efficiently produced (295.28 +/-\\n      5.42 U/mL) with complete feather degradation (95.3 +/- 1.5%). Moreover, the\\n      keratinase from P. aeruginosa 4-3 showed high optimal temperature (55 degrees C),\\n      good thermal stability, wide pH tolerance, and excellent organic solvent\\n      resistance. In addition, P. aeruginosa 4-3-derived aminopeptidases also exhibit\\n      excellent thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance. Encouragingly, the\\n      reaction of crude keratinase and aminopeptidase with feathers for 8 h resulted in\\n      a 78% degradation rate of feathers. These properties make P. aeruginosa 4-3\\n      keratinase and aminopeptidase ideal proteases for potential applications in\\n      keratin degradation, as well as provide ideas for the synergistic degradation of \\n      keratin by multiple enzymes.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

However, analysing the trend and\\n      pattern of rainfall over the urban areas has a number of challenges such as\\n      availability of long-term data as well as the uneven distribution of rain-gauge\\n      stations. In this research, the rainfall regionalization approach has been\\n      applied along with the advanced statistical techniques for analysing the trend\\n      and pattern of rainfall in the Delhi metropolitan city. Fuzzy C-means and K-means\\n      clustering techniques have been applied for the identification of homogeneous\\n      rainfall regions while innovative trend analysis (ITA) along with the family of\\n      Mann-Kendall (MK) tests has been applied for the trend analysis of rainfall. The \\n      result shows that in all rain-gauge stations of Delhi, an increasing trend in\\n      rainfall has been recorded during 1991-2018. But the rate of increase was low as \\n      the trend slope of ITA and Sen\\'s slope in MK tests are low, which varies between \\n      0.03 and 0.05 and 0.01 and 0.16, respectively. Furthermore, none of the\\n      rain-gauge stations have experienced a monotonic trend in rainfall as the null\\n      hypothesis has not been rejected (p value > 0.05) for any stations. Furthermore, \\n      the study shows that ITA has a better performance than the family of MK tests.\\n      The findings of this study may be utilized for the urban flood mitigation and\\n      solving other issues related to water resources in Delhi and other cities.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the association between\\n      dietary total antioxidant capacity (DTAC) and H. pylori infection. METHODS: A\\n      case-control study was carried out among 200 patients with H. pylori infection\\n      and 402 healthy subjects (18-55 years). Dietary data were collected using a\\n      validated 168-item quantitative food frequency questionnaire. DTAC was calculated\\n      based on the oxygen radical absorbance capacity of each food (except for coffee) \\n      reported by the US Department of Agriculture. RESULTS: Compared with participants\\n      in the lowest tertile of DTAC, those in the highest tertile had a significantly\\n      lower odds ratio (OR) in the crude model (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.14-0.61; p for\\n      trend = 0.001), model 1 (adjustment for age and sex) (OR, 0.37; 95% CI,\\n      0.24-0.58; p for trend < 0.001), and model 2 (adjustment for model 1 plus body\\n      mass index, waist circumference, physical activity, smoking, dietary intake of\\n      energy and fat) (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.10-0.40; p for trend </= 0.001).\\n      CONCLUSIONS: A high DTAC is associated with a reduced risk of H. pylori infection\\n      in adults.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 152 consecutive\\n      patients (98 males, 64.5%; mean age 64.9 +/- 9.6 years) underwent a repeat\\n      ablation for recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias after a median time of 6.5 months \\n      [IQR 11] from the index CB ablation. All repeat ablations were performed using a \\n      3-dimensional electro-anatomical mapping system. Among all 593 PVs, 134 (22.6%)\\n      showed a late PV reconnection in 95 patients (0.88 per patient), at the time of\\n      repeat ablation procedure. There was a significant difference in ovality between \\n      left- and right-sided PVs (p < 0.001). Greater diameters of left superior PV,\\n      left inferior PV, and right inferior PV ostia (both maximum and minimum) and\\n      higher index ovality were significantly associated with late PV reconnection.\\n      CONCLUSIONS: The rate of late PV reconnection after CB ablation was low (0.88\\n      PVs/patient). Left-sided PVs were more oval than septal PVs. Larger PV dimensions\\n      and higher ovality index were significantly associated with reconnections in all \\n      PVs except for RSPV.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

In this report, we aimed to compare selective coronary\\n      angiography (SCA) through the contact force (CF)-sensing radiofrequency catheter \\n      with conventional coronary angiography (CCA) to guide ablation of premature\\n      ventricular contractions (PVC). METHODS: This was a retrospective observational\\n      cohort study of prospectively collected data of 87 consecutive patients\\n      undergoing PVC ablation at a single institution between February 2016 and June\\n      2021. Forty-six patients (53%) underwent SCA and forty-one patients (47%)\\n      underwent CCA. Data were consecutively collected case-by-case and entered into a \\n      computerized database. Procedural characteristics, complications, and clinical\\n      outcomes were compared between the SCA and CCA groups. RESULTS: Successful\\n      ablation was achieved in seventy-seven (89%) patients. Total procedure and\\n      fluoroscopy time and radiation dose were significantly lower in SCA group (93 +/-\\n      22 min vs 102 +/- 20 min, p = 0.042; 12 +/- 3 min vs 14 +/- 4 min, p = 0.030;\\n      3292 +/- 1221 muGy m(2) vs 3880 +/- 1229 muGy m(2), p = 0.028, respectively).\\n      Median ambulation time was significantly longer in CCA group (6.8 +/- 1 h vs 17.8\\n      +/- 1.8 h, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Selective coronary angiography through the\\n      CF-sensing ablation catheter to assess the relation between the ablation site and\\n      the coronary ostia is feasible and safe. This technique precludes the requirement\\n      of an additional arterial access and decreases the total procedure and\\n      fluoroscopy time and radiation dose.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

Total pain\\n      burden (TPB) combines frequency, duration, and severity of migraine headache, and\\n      has the potential to further characterize the benefit of preventive treatment\\n      using a single composite measure. TPB was previously used to characterize\\n      response to galcanezumab (GMB) in patients with migraine. In this post hoc\\n      analysis we assessed the impact of GMB in lowering TPB in patients who had\\n      previously not benefited from two to four categories of migraine preventive\\n      medication. METHODS: CONQUER trial patients (N = 462), 18-75 years old who had\\n      previously not benefited from two to four categories of migraine preventive\\n      medication, were randomized (1:1) to monthly placebo or GMB 120 mg with 240 mg\\n      loading dose. For each patient, monthly TPB in severity-weighted hours was\\n      calculated by multiplying migraine headache duration (hours) by maximum severity \\n      for each migraine headache day, then summing these daily scores over the month\\n      for the monthly score. Changes from baseline in monthly TPB across months 1-3\\n      were analyzed. Spearman correlations between TPB and scores on the\\n      Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ) total and Migraine\\n      Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) were assessed at baseline. RESULTS: Mean (SD)\\n      baseline monthly TPB was 192.1 (158.3) and 188.2 (197.4) severity-weighted hours \\n      for GMB-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Across the 3-month\\n      double-blind period, GMB-treated patients experienced significantly greater mean \\n      reductions from baseline in monthly TPB compared with placebo-treated patients,\\n      both for mean change (GMB - 82.7, placebo - 15.8, p < 0.001) and percentage\\n      change (GMB - 38.6%, placebo 9.4%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, baseline TPB\\n      correlated with MSQ score (r = - 0.39) and MIDAS score (r = 0.40), suggesting\\n      good association of TPB with functional and disability outcomes. CONCLUSION: GMB \\n      reduced mean TPB in patients who had previously not benefited from two to four\\n      categories of migraine preventive medication.

The present study explored the associations of\\n      patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and disease-specific measures with\\n      functional capacity as measured by the 6-min walk test (6MWT) in persons with\\n      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Seventy-nine participants from rheumatology\\n      outpatient clinics were included. The distance walked during the 6MWT (6MWD) was \\n      the dependent variable in multivariable regression analyses. Model 1 included the\\n      independent variables sex, age (in tertiles to improve model fit), and body mass \\n      index (BMI). Building on Model 1, Model 2 added smoking, patient global\\n      assessment (PGA), Exercise Self-Efficacy, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\\'s\\n      Depression score, and Cohen\\'s Perceived Stress Scale score, whereas Model 3 added\\n      smoking, disease duration, present use of glucocorticosteroids, seropositivity,\\n      Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP), and a comorbidity\\n      variable. RESULTS: Median age was 65 years, 76% were female, and median 6MWD was \\n      493 m. In Model 1, BMI and age were significantly associated with the 6MWD (R(2) \\n      = 0.42). In Model 2, PGA and Exercise Self-Efficacy were also significantly\\n      associated with the 6MWD, with standardized regression coefficients of - 0.21 (p \\n      = 0.03) and 0.26 (p = 0.004) respectively (R(2) = 0.54). The RA-specific\\n      variables in Model 3 were not significantly associated with the 6MWD (R(2) =\\n      0.49). CONCLUSION: The PROMs PGA and Exercise Self-Efficacy were significantly\\n      associated with functional capacity as measured by the 6MWT in persons with RA,\\n      whereas disease-specific measures such as DAS28-CRP and disease duration were\\n      not. Key Points * Functional capacity measured with the 6-minute walk test was\\n      significantly associated with body mass index, age, patient global assessment,\\n      and Exercise Self-Efficacy in persons with RA. * Patient-reported outcome\\n      measures explained more of the variation in functional capacity than objective or\\n      composite measures of disease and are relevant measures in clinical follow-up. * \\n      Techniques that enhance self-efficacy for exercise should be incorporated into\\n      clinical practice to promote physical activity.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

This study examined factors associated with \\n      the utilization of the two main bariatric surgical techniques: laparoscopic\\n      sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB).\\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample database was queried for\\n      patients who underwent elective LSG or LRYGB for the treatment of severe obesity.\\n      Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression assessed associations of\\n      surgical approach with patient and facility characteristics. Sensitivity analyses\\n      examined the following body mass index (BMI) subgroups: < 40.0 kg/m(2), 40.0-44.9\\n      kg/m(2), 45.0-49.9 kg/m(2), and >/= 50.0 kg/m(2). RESULTS: Within the final\\n      cohort (N = 86,053), 73.0% (N = 62,779) underwent LSG, and 27.0% (N = 23,274)\\n      underwent LRYGB. Patients with BMI 45.0-49.9 kg/m(2) (OR = 0.85) and BMI >/= 50.0\\n      kg/m(2) (OR = 0.80) were less likely to undergo LSG than patients with BMI\\n      40.0-45.0 kg/m(2) (all p < 0.001). However, Black (OR = 1.74) and White Hispanic \\n      patients (OR = 1.30) were more likely to undergo LSG than White non-Hispanic\\n      patients (all p < 0.005). In the BMI >/= 50.0 kg/m(2) group, Black patients were \\n      still more likely to undergo LSG compared to White non-Hispanic patients (OR =\\n      1.69, p < 0.001), while Asians/Pacific Islanders were less likely to receive LSG \\n      than White non-Hispanic patients (OR = 0.41, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this\\n      observational study, we identified racial differences in the selection of common \\n      bariatric surgical approaches across various BMI categories. Future\\n      investigations are warranted to study and to promote awareness of the\\n      racial/ethnic influence in attitudes on obesity, weight loss, financial support, \\n      and surgical risks during bariatric discussions with minorities.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

Here,\\n      we study the effect of area available for fibrillatory waves to sustain AF. Then \\n      we use it to plan for AF ablation to improve procedural outcomes. CARPentry was\\n      used to create patient-specific models to determine the association between the\\n      size of residual contiguous areas available for AF wavefronts to propagate and\\n      sustain AF [fibrillatory area (FA)] after ablation with procedural outcomes. The \\n      FA was quantified in a novel manner accounting for gaps in ablation lines. We\\n      selected 30 persistent AF patients with known ablation outcomes. We divided the\\n      atrial surface into five areas based on ablation scar pattern and anatomical\\n      landmarks and calculated the FAs. We validated the models based on clinical\\n      outcomes and suggested future ablation lines that minimize the FAs and terminate \\n      rotor activities in simulations. We also simulated the effects of three common\\n      antiarrhythmic drugs. In the patient-specific models, the predicted arrhythmias\\n      matched the clinical outcomes in 25 of 30 patients (accuracy 83.33%). The average\\n      largest FA (FAmax) in the recurrence group was 8517 +/- 1444 vs. 6772 +/- 1531\\n      mm(2) in the no recurrence group (p < 0.004). The final FAs after adding the\\n      suggested ablation lines in the AF recurrence group reduced the average FAmax\\n      from 8517 +/- 1444 to 6168 +/- 1358 mm(2) (p < 0.001) and stopped the sustained\\n      rotor activity. Simulations also correctly anticipated the effect of\\n      antiarrhythmic drugs in 5 out of 6 patients who used drug therapy post\\n      unsuccessful ablation (accuracy 83.33%). Sizes of FAs available for AF wavefronts\\n      to propagate are important determinants for ablation outcomes. FA size in\\n      combination with computational simulations can be used to direct ablation in\\n      persistent AF to minimize the critical mass required to sustain recurrent AF.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

We aimed to explore the role of\\n      PCSK9 in septic endothelial dysfunction. Sepsis was induced by lipopolysaccharide\\n      (LPS) treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro and\\n      cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery in mice in vivo. Evolocumab (EVC) and\\n      Pep 2-8, PCSK9 inhibitors, were subsequently used to determine the role of PCSK9 \\n      in sepsis-induced endothelial dysfunction in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In \\n      addition, the TLR4 agonist, Kdo2-Lipid A ammonium (KLA), was used to determine\\n      the related mechanism. Protein expression of eNOS, VE-cadherin, PCSK9, TLR4,\\n      MyD88, p-p65, p65, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 p20 in mice aortas and HUVECs was\\n      measured by western blotting, while mRNA expression of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and\\n      IL-18 was determined by qRT-PCR. The level of inflammatory cytokines of mouse\\n      aortas was visualized by immunohistochemistry. Vasodilation of the aorta was\\n      detected by vascular reactivity experiments. The 96-h survival rate after CLP was\\n      assessed. Our findings showed that the expression of eNOS and VE-cadherin\\n      decreased, and PCSK9 expression increased, in septic HUVECs or mice. Inhibition\\n      of PCSK9 increased eNOS and VE-cadherin expression. Activation of the\\n      TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB and NLRP3 pathways may be responsible for PCSK9-induced\\n      endothelial dysfunction in sepsis. Vascular reactivity tests and survival studies\\n      showed that inhibition of PCSK9 could prevent the decrease in\\n      endothelium-dependent vasodilation function and improve the survival rates of\\n      septic mice. In summary, our results suggested that increased PCSK9 expression\\n      during sepsis activated the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB and NLRP3 pathways to induce\\n      inflammation, which resulted in vascular endothelial dysfunction and decreased\\n      survival rates. Thus, inhibition of PCSK9 may be a potential clinical therapeutic\\n      target to improve vascular endothelial function in sepsis.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

METHODS: Medical records of 240 preterm infants\\n      were reviewed retrospectively, 85 of them were grouped as type 1, type 2 ROP, and\\n      control group. The 4th week hepatic and renal function test results of the\\n      groups, on the day of their first ROP examinations, were compared for the risk of\\n      development of ROP and the development of type 1 ROP. RESULTS: In this study, 12,\\n      35, and 38 infants were enrolled in the type 1, type 2 ROP, and control group,\\n      respectively. The average gestational age and birth weight were higher; however, \\n      the duration of oxygen treatment was lower in the control group (p < 0.001). The \\n      blood glucose level was significantly higher in the type 1 ROP group than in the \\n      other groups (p = 0.023). The mean of total serum bilirubin of the type 1 ROP\\n      group was significantly lower than those of the type 2 ROP and control group (p =\\n      0.032). Proteinuria was present in 85.7% of preterms with treatment-requiring ROP\\n      and proteinuria increased the risk of ROP by 3.9 times (OR with 95% CI 3.9\\n      (1.19-12.75), p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: We found significantly higher blood glucose\\n      and lower total bilirubin level in the type 1 ROP group. Moreover, our findings\\n      suggest that proteinuria may not be only a comorbidity factor but also related to\\n      a higher frequency of ROP and type 1 ROP in preterm infants.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

Thus, the aim of this meta-analysis\\n      and meta-regression was to assess the impact of volume and intensity of aerobic\\n      exercise on glycaemic control. METHODS: Medline, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of\\n      Science databases were searched up until 15 December 2020 for the terms \"aerobic \\n      exercise AND glycaemic control\", \"type 2 diabetes AND exercise\", and \"exercise\\n      AND glycaemic control AND Type 2 diabetes AND randomised control trial\". We\\n      included (i) randomised control trials of >/= 12 weeks, (ii) trials where\\n      participants had type 2 diabetes and were aged 18 or over, and (iii) the trial\\n      reported HbA1c concentrations pre- and post-intervention. Two reviewers selected \\n      studies and extracted data. Data are reported as standardised mean difference\\n      (SMD) and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. RESULTS: A total of\\n      5364 original titles were identified. Sixteen studies were included in the\\n      meta-analysis. Aerobic exercise reduced HbA1c versus control (SMD = 0.56 (95% CI \\n      0.3-0.82), p < 0.001). There were also significant reductions in BMI (SMD = 0.76 \\n      (95% CI 0.25-1.27), p < 0.05). There was no dose-response relationship between\\n      improvement in HbA1c and the intensity and volume of the intervention (p > 0.05).\\n      CONCLUSIONS: Twelve-week or longer aerobic exercise programmes improve glycaemic \\n      control and BMI in adults with type 2 diabetes. Longer or more intense\\n      interventions appear to confer no additional benefit on HbA1c.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

The \\n      sizes of the latter varied from 180 microm to 4 mm. A higher amount of\\n      microplastics collected/6-kg sand sample was recorded at LC. Two-way ANOVA\\n      revealed that (1) there was a considerable gap in the variability regarding\\n      quantity and size distribution of microplastics on the two beaches. The post-hoc \\n      analysis showed that the majority of the microplastics at LC were > 1.40 mm,\\n      whereas the smaller plastic fragments < 1.40 mm were more dominant at TD. (2)\\n      There was a significant interaction between location and event (p value = 0.025).\\n      The post-hoc analysis showed that the torrential rain hitting the island prior to\\n      sampling week 7 had decreased the microplastic counts at both TD and LC, but not \\n      significantly. Interestingly, the two hurricanes, prior to weeks 8 and 9, had\\n      appreciably reduced the microplastic counts at TD and, on the other hand, there\\n      was an increase in the amount of microplastics at LC, but not to a significant\\n      effect. The chemical nature (qualitative analysis) of microplastics was\\n      determined by density flotation and FTIR spectroscopy. Microplastics at TD were\\n      exclusively high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in origin, whereas, at LC,\\n      microplastics were both HDPE and polypropylene (PP) in origin.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

On average, 12\\n      SB cores and 3.7 MRI-TB cores were taken per biopsy session during the study\\n      period. Infection-related complications within 30 days were compared. The primary\\n      endpoint was a positive urine culture.

METHODS: Data from 3-day weighed food records were collected from\\n      children at ages 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 years from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland and \\n      Spain. Food intakes were assigned to EO based on country-specific daytimes for\\n      breakfast, lunch, supper and snacks (morning, afternoon). The average energy and \\n      nutrient intakes were expressed as percentage of total energy intake (%E).\\n      Nutrients were additionally expressed as percentage per EO (%EEO). Foods were\\n      assigned to food groups; variation in intake was calculated via coefficient of\\n      variation (CV). We analyzed age trends in diurnal intake using mixed-effects beta\\n      regression. RESULTS: The 740 healthy children included in the analysis consumed\\n      the largest proportion of daily energy at lunch (31%E +/- 8, M +/- SD) and supper\\n      (26%E +/- 8), followed by breakfast (19%E +/- 7) and snacks [afternoon (16%E +/- \\n      8); morning (8%E +/- 7)], with the most variable intake at morning snack (CV =\\n      0.9). The nutrient composition at lunch and supper was highest for fat (36 +/-\\n      9%ELunch; 39 +/- 11%ESupper) and protein (18 +/- 5%ELunch; 18 +/- 6%ESupper) and \\n      at breakfast and snacks for carbohydrates (54 +/- 12%EBreakfast; 62 +/-\\n      12%ESnacks). High-sugar content foods were consumed in relatively large\\n      proportions at breakfast and snacks. Food intakes varied significantly with age, \\n      with lower snack intakes at later ages (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Possibly\\n      unhealthy EOs with high-fat intakes and high-sugar-content foods were observed.\\n      Changes in nutrient composition of EOs may be beneficial for health.

Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon\\n      idella) is a highly productive fish in freshwater culture. To understand the\\n      molecular mechanism of grass carp under heat stress, we used RNA-Seq to analyze\\n      the liver and brain transcriptome of 12 libraries constructed from\\n      high-temperature (36 degrees C) and control (28 degrees C) groups. We obtained\\n      42.49 and 42.57 GB of clean data from six liver and six brain libraries,\\n      respectively, and identified 2,534 genes that were differentially expressed in\\n      liver tissue and 1622 in brain tissue (P < 0.05). According to KEGG analysis,\\n      significant differences occurred in the expression of genes involved in metabolic\\n      and immune pathways, such as the cAMP signaling pathway, apoptosis, calcium\\n      signaling pathway, lipid metabolism, and protein processing in endoplasmic\\n      reticulum and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathways. This\\n      study revealed that high temperature enhanced lipid metabolism, reduced fatty\\n      acid synthesis, and disrupted the immune system of grass carp. These results\\n      investigated the molecular regulation of heat stress in grass carp and provided\\n      valuable information for the healthy culture of grass carp under high\\n      temperatures.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

Biomechanical data suggest that cemented conical stems can be\\n      removed significantly easier than cylindrical stems. However, no clinical\\n      evidence exists supporting this observation. Aim of this study was to compare the\\n      revisability and need for osteotomy (OT) between removals of well-fixed cemented \\n      conical vs. cylindrical RTKA stems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 55 removals of\\n      well-fixed full-cemented RTKA stems (29 knees) performed between 2016 and 2018\\n      were retrospectively analyzed. Main outcome variables were: bone loss, fractures,\\n      osteotomy incidence, surgery duration, early postoperative complications (EPC),\\n      hemoglobin drop and blood transfusion. SPSS was used for the statistical\\n      analysis. RESULTS: 44.8% were conical, 48.3% cylindrical, and 6.9% combined stem \\n      designs. Causes for re-revision were PJI (75.9%), malposition (17.2%) and\\n      persistent pain (6.9%). 10 stem removals (18.2%) required an OT (four femoral,\\n      six tibial): eight stems (14.5%) had cylindrical and two (3.6%) conical designs\\n      (P = 0.041). Fractures were noted solely in removals without OT (11.1% vs. 0%,). \\n      There was a tendency to more bone loss in cylindrical stem revisions (53.8% vs.\\n      32%, P = 0.24). A longer overall surgery time was observed in revisions of\\n      cylindrical stems (+ 37 min, P = 0.05). There was higher hemoglobin drop and need\\n      for blood transfusion in revisions of cylindrical stems or after OT but without\\n      reaching statistical significance. The EPC rates were slightly higher in ReRTKA\\n      on cylindrical stems (P = 0.28). CONCLUSION: Well-fixed cemented conical stems\\n      may be revision friendlier with less demands on OT and shorter overall surgery\\n      time than cemented cylindrical stems.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

We hypothesised that patients with mild arthritis were\\n      more likely to report lower satisfaction, improvement in knee function and Oxford\\n      knee score (OKS) compared to patients with moderate or severe arthritis.\\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from\\n      TKA patients of two arthroplasty centres with knee radiographs available for\\n      assessment of disease severity. Patients completed the Oxford knee score (OKS)\\n      and were asked to rate the global improvement in knee condition and their\\n      satisfaction at 6 months post-TKA. Bivariable analysis and multivariable\\n      regression models were used to test the association between disease severity and \\n      each outcome. RESULTS: 2226 patients underwent primary TKA and 3.6% had mild\\n      arthritis. Mean OKS improved from 17.0 (SD 18.0) to 38.0 (SD 8.1) 6 months after \\n      TKA. Two hundred and twenty-two patients (10%) reported \\'Poor\\' or \\'Fair\\'\\n      satisfaction, and 173 (8%) reported knee function was \\'Much worse\\', \\'A little\\n      worse\\' or \\'About the same\\' 6 months post-TKA. Patients with mild arthritis showed\\n      improvement in OKS [mean improvement in OKS = 19 (SD 15)], but were significantly\\n      more likely to report dissatisfaction (OR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.62 to 5.91, p =\\n      0.006), lack of improvement (OR = 4.49, 95% CI 2.38 to 8.47, p < 0.001) and lower\\n      OKS scores (- 3 points, 95% CI - 5.39 to - 0.85, p = 0.008) compared to patients \\n      with moderate to severe arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: While patients with mild\\n      radiographic arthritic changes improve after TKA, they were significantly more\\n      likely to report higher rates of dissatisfaction, less improvement in knee\\n      function and OKS compared to patients with moderate-severe grades of arthritis.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

METHODS: A single-institution review was\\n      performed in children aged 3-18 with FC who underwent a BMP from 2014 to 2020.\\n      Clinical characteristics, bowel management details, and the Vancouver Symptom\\n      Score for Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome (VSS), Baylor Continence Scale\\n      (BCS), and Cleveland Clinic Constipation Score (CCCS) were collected. Data were\\n      analyzed using linear mixed effect modeling with random intercept. RESULTS: 241\\n      patients were included with a median age of 9 years. Most were White 81 and 47%\\n      were female. Univariate tests showed improvement in VSS (- 3.6, P < 0.0001), BCS \\n      (- 11.96, P < 0.0001), and CCCS (- 1.9, P < 0.0001) among patients having\\n      undergone one BMP. Improvement was noted in VSS and CCCS among those with more\\n      than one BMP (VSS: - 1.66, P = 0.023; CCCS: - 2.69, P < 0.0001). Multivariate\\n      tests indicated undergoing a BMP does result in significant improvement in VSS,\\n      BCS, and CCCS (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There is significant improvement in\\n      bladder function in children with FC who undergo a BMP.

This triatomine species occurs in central Mexico, but\\n      little is known about its genetic variability. Using Cyt-b gene as a genetic\\n      marker, in this study, we determined the population genetic structure of T.\\n      mexicana collected from the States of Hidalgo, Guanajuato, and Queretaro where\\n      populations are largely peridomiciliary. A Bayesian approach was performed for\\n      the design of phylogenies, median-joining networks, and clustering among\\n      populations of T. mexicana. Our results show that the Hidalgo population was the \\n      most distinct, with the highest genetic and haplotypic variation (Hd = 0.963, pi \\n      = 0.06129, and = 0.05469). Moderate gene flow (Nm) was determined among\\n      populations of Hidalgo and Queretaro. Populations from the three states showed\\n      differentiation (FST) values ranging from 0.22 to 0.3, suggesting an important\\n      genetic differentiation. The phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of five\\n      well-defined groups, as well as the haplotype network, where 24 haplotypes were\\n      observed forming five haplogroups with high mutational steps among them: 68\\n      (Hgo-W2), 26 (Qto), 59 (Hgo-M), 44 (Hgo-W1), and 46 (Gto). Genetic isolation was \\n      apparently inferred in the Guanajuato population; however, the Mantel test did\\n      not show correlation between genetic (FST) and geographic (km) distances (p =\\n      0.05). The STRUCTURE analyses showed seven genetic clusters and it was observed\\n      that a single cluster predominates in each sampled location. However, genetic\\n      admixture was detected in four localities. Our results show evidence that there\\n      are multiple species within the collected sampling area.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

DTarTA contained D-tartaric acid\\n      as a carbon source and potassium tellurite, ampicillin sodium, and methyl violet \\n      as antibiotics. DTarTA suppressed growth in 19 of the 24 pathovars from the P.\\n      syringae complex, whereas Psm and Pca grew and formed gray to black colonies.\\n      SPamt contained sucrose and peptone as nutrient sources and was supplemented with\\n      bromothymol blue and the same antibiotics present in DTarTA and Psm and Pca\\n      formed yellowish to dark brown colonies on the SPamt medium. SPbc contained\\n      sucrose and peptone and was supplemented with cephalexin and boric acid as\\n      antibiotics and Psm and Pca formed semi-translucent to white colonies on the SPbc\\n      medium. SPamt and SPbc suppressed the growth of several plant-associated bacteria\\n      (except the P. syringae complex). The growth of saprophytic bacteria in seeds on \\n      the different media was compared with that on King\\'s B medium, using five types\\n      of commercially available Raphanus sativus seeds. The suppression rate of DTarTA \\n      was 85-99% and was lower for seeds with more saprophytic bacteria. The\\n      suppression rates of SPamt and SPbc were 90-99%. In detection tests using 10,000 \\n      seed samples mixed with Pca or Psm-contaminated seeds, it was possible to\\n      selectively isolate Psm and Pca using SPamt and SPbc, even when the colony\\n      numbers of the target bacterium constituted less than 10% of the total colonies. \\n      KEY POINTS: * Bacterial leaf spot and blight pathogens were selectively isolated \\n      from seeds. * DTarTA medium distinguishes these pathogens from P. syringae\\n      complex pathovars. * SPamp and SPbc media have different selectivity for\\n      plant-associated bacteria.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

PSMA-targeted PET/CT imaging with\\n      long-lived radionuclides as (89)Zr (T1/2 = 78.4 h) may improve diagnostics by\\n      allowing data acquisition on later time points. In this study, we present our\\n      first clinical experience including preliminary biodistribution and dosimetry\\n      data of [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in patients with BCR of prostate cancer.\\n      METHODS: Seven patients with BCR of prostate cancer who revealed no (n = 4) or\\n      undetermined (n = 3) findings on [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging were referred \\n      to [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT. PET/CT imaging was performed 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, and \\n      72 h post injection (p.i.) of 111 +/- 11 MBq [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 (mean +/-\\n      standard deviation). Normal organ distribution and dosimetry were determined.\\n      Lesions visually considered as suggestive of prostate cancer were quantitatively \\n      analyzed. RESULTS: Intense physiological uptake was observed in the salivary and \\n      lacrimal glands, liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine and urinary tract. The parotid\\n      gland received the highest absorbed dose (0.601 +/- 0.185 mGy/MBq), followed by\\n      the kidneys (0.517 +/- 0.125 mGy/MBq). The estimated overall effective dose for\\n      the administration of 111 MBq was 10.1 mSv (0.0913 +/- 0.0118 mSv/MBq). In 6\\n      patients, and in particular in 3 of 4 patients with negative [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11\\n      PET/CT, at least one prostate cancer lesion was detected in [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617\\n      PET/CT imaging at later time points. The majority of tumor lesions were first\\n      visible at 24 h p.i. with continuously increasing tumor-to-background ratio over \\n      time. All tumor lesions were detectable at 48 h and 72 h p.i. CONCLUSION:\\n      [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT imaging is a promising new diagnostic tool with\\n      acceptable radiation exposure for patients with prostate cancer especially when\\n      [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging fails detecting recurrent disease. The long\\n      half-life of (89)Zr enables late time point imaging (up to 72 h in our study)\\n      with increased tracer uptake in tumor lesions and higher tumor-to-background\\n      ratios allowing identification of lesions non-visible on [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11\\n      PET/CT imaging.\\nCI  - (c) 2022.

We aim to report on \\n      Mn levels and their short term impact on clinical course in very low birth weight\\n      infants. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study including newborns with a\\n      gestational age (GA) </=32 weeks and/or </=1500g of birth weight (BW). Newborns\\n      received intravenous supplementation of Mn at 1 microg/kg/day (Peditrace(R)) in\\n      PN and continued with fortified breast milk. Mothers answered surveys about\\n      dietary and other habits and blood levels of Mn in newborns were analyzed at days\\n      1,15 and 30 of life. Associations of Mn levels with mothers\\' and newborns\\' data\\n      were evaluated and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: 160 premature\\n      infants were recruited. Median blood Mn levels at birth were 43.0 and 24.5\\n      microg/L at day 30. No important association with mothers\\' data was found. Median\\n      (IQR) duration of PN was 8 days (7-14). A prolonged PN and late oral feeding\\n      showed a non-significant association with lower blood Mn levels at day 30 (P =\\n      .010, P threshold .003). Mn levels at day 15 and 30 were associated with\\n      increasing GA (P < .001). Low Mn was not a significant predictor of adverse\\n      outcomes such as retinopathy of prematurity, bronchodysplasia or respiratory\\n      distress syndrome after adjusting for potential confounders and multiple testing.\\n      CONCLUSIONS: Mn showed lower levels with decreasing GA and prolonged PN.

The gut microbiota, in turn, plays crucial roles in the modulation of\\n      drug efficacy. We aimed to assess the impacts of acarbose and vildagliptin on\\n      human gut microbiota and the relationships between pre-treatment gut microbiota\\n      and therapeutic responses. METHODS: This was a randomised, open-labelled, two-arm\\n      trial in treatment-naive type 2 diabetes patients conducted in Beijing between\\n      December 2016 and December 2017. One hundred participants with overweight/obesity\\n      and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were recruited from the Pinggu Hospital and\\n      randomly assigned to the acarbose (n=50) or vildagliptin (n=50) group using\\n      sealed envelopes. The treatment period was 6 months. Blood, faecal samples and\\n      visceral fat data from computed tomography images were collected before and after\\n      treatments to measure therapeutic outcomes and gut microbiota. Metagenomic\\n      datasets from a previous type 2 diabetes cohort receiving acarbose or glipizide\\n      for 3 months were downloaded and processed. Statistical analyses were applied to \\n      identify the treatment-related changes in clinical variables, gut microbiota and \\n      associations. RESULTS: Ninety-two participants were analysed. After 6 months of\\n      acarbose (n=44) or vildagliptin (n=48) monotherapy, both groups achieved\\n      significant reductions in HbA1c (from 60 to 46 mmol/mol [from 7.65% to 6.40%] in \\n      the acarbose group and from 59 to 44 mmol/mol [from 7.55% to 6.20%] in the\\n      vildagliptin group) and visceral fat areas (all adjusted p values for pre-post\\n      comparisons <0.05). Both arms showed drug-specific and shared changes in relative\\n      abundances of multiple gut microbial species and pathways, especially the common \\n      reductions in Bacteroidetes species. Three months and 6 months of\\n      acarbose-induced changes in microbial composition were highly similar in type 2\\n      diabetes patients from the two independent studies. Vildagliptin treatment\\n      significantly enhanced fasting active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels.\\n      Baseline gut microbiota, rather than baseline GLP-1 levels, were strongly\\n      associated with GLP-1 response to vildagliptin, and to a lesser extent with GLP-1\\n      response to acarbose. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study reveals common\\n      microbial responses in type 2 diabetes patients treated with two glucose-lowering\\n      drugs targeting the gut differently and acceptable performance of baseline gut\\n      microbiota in classifying individuals with different GLP-1 responses to\\n      vildagliptin. Our findings highlight bidirectional interactions between gut\\n      microbiota and glucose-lowering drugs.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: An accurate preoperative identification of\\n      N+ in NF-PanNETs is critical for surgical planning. The accuracy of different\\n      imaging techniques in detecting lymph node (LN) metastases in NF-PanNETs has been\\n      poorly investigated. METHODS: All consecutive patients undergoing surgery for\\n      sporadic NF-PanNETs (2018-2021) were enrolled in a prospective study (DETECTYON; \\n      NCT03918759). The accuracy of preoperative imaging techniques in detecting N+ was\\n      assessed through sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive\\n      values (NPV). RESULTS: Overall, 100 patients with NF-PanNETs underwent CE-CT, EUS\\n      and 68Ga-DOTATOC-PET before pancreatic resection. LN metastases were found in 42 \\n      cases (42%). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of different imaging\\n      techniques were 26%, 95%, 79%, 64% for CE-CT, 19%, 98%, 89%, 63% for EUS and 12%,\\n      95%, 63%, 60% for 68Ga-DOTATOC-PET, respectively. Radiological tumor size >4 cm\\n      and the presence of radiological N+ at >/=1 imaging were independent predictors\\n      of N+ at pathology. The identification of N+ at >/=1 imaging technique was\\n      associated with a higher number of positive LNs compared to negative imaging (4\\n      vs. 2) (P=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: CE-CT, EUS and 68Ga-DOTATOC-PET are poorly\\n      sensitive in predicting nodal status in NF-PanNETs despite a high specificity.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Tissue samples of 110 Thai patients with EC, who had undergone\\n      surgical staging, were tested for mismatch repair (MMR) gene deficiency, and the \\n      patients were grouped into MSI-H and MSI-stable (MSI-S) groups; 24.5% had MSI-H. \\n      Unlike MSI-S group patients, MSI-H group patients had synchronous and\\n      metachronous cancer. They showed better 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) than\\n      those in the MSI-S group (p=.182; 92.3% vs. 82.6%). The 3-year overall survival\\n      was 96.2% in MSI-H and 86.4% in MSI-S groups (p=.163). Multivariate analyses\\n      showed lower uterine involvement (p=.004), myometrial invasion >/=50% (p=.032),\\n      lymphovascular space invasion (p<.001) and MSI-S (p=.006) as prognostic factors\\n      for DFS. Our study showed that the prevalence of MMR gene deficiency in Thai\\n      patients with EC is common and associated with better outcomes.Impact\\n      StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Microsatellite instability (MSI) \\n      occurs in approximately 20-40% of endometrial cancer (EC) cases. MSI analysis in \\n      EC can identify patients at higher risk of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal\\n      cancer and those having prognostic factors. Additionally, it is predictive of\\n      immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. However, current evidence shows a\\n      correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and EC prognosis. Studies\\n      on EC and MSI status effect on survival outcome have yielded inconsistent results\\n      regarding the pathological significance of MSI in such malignancies.What do the\\n      results of this study add? The prevalence of mismatch repair (MMR) gene\\n      deficiency in Thai patients with EC is common (24.5%) and associated with better \\n      outcomes.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or\\n      further research? This study highlights the prevalence and impact of MSI on\\n      oncological outcomes in patients with EC in a low-incidence country. Future\\n      studies should focus on the detection of germline mutation to understand the\\n      accurate prevalence of Lynch syndrome in Thai patients with EC.\\nFAU - Atjimakul, Thiti\\nAU  - Atjimakul T\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla\\n      University, Songkhla, Thailand.\\nFAU - Wattanapaisal, Panote\\nAU  - Wattanapaisal P\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla\\n      University, Songkhla, Thailand.\\nFAU - Suwiwat, Supaporn\\nAU  - Suwiwat S\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University,\\n      Songkhla, Thailand.\\nFAU - Wanichsuwan, Worrawit\\nAU  - Wanichsuwan W\\nAD  - Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University,\\n      Songkhla, Thailand.\\nFAU - Hanprasertpong, Jitti\\nAU  - Hanprasertpong J\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0640-6824\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla\\n      University, Songkhla, Thailand.\\nAD  - Department of Research and Medical Innovation, Faculty of Medicine Vajira\\n      Hospital, Navamindradhiraj University, Bangkok, Thailand.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - J Obstet Gynaecol\\nJT  - Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of\\n      Obstetrics and Gynaecology\\nJID - 8309140\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Mismatch repair gene\\nOT  - Thai\\nOT  - disease-free survival\\nOT  - endometrial cancer\\nOT  - microsatellite instability\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 11:13\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 11:13 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/01443615.2022.2106557 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Obstet Gynaecol. 2022 Aug 5:1-7. doi: 10.1080/01443615.2022.2106557.\\n\\nPMID- 35930015\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1938-5404 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0033-7587 (Linking)\\nVI  - 198\\nIP  - 2\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 1\\nTI  - The Efficacy of Radiation is Enhanced by Metformin and Hyperthermia Alone or\\n      Combined Against FSaII Fibrosarcoma in C3H Mice.\\nPG  - 190-199\\nLID - 10.1667/RADE-21-00231.1 [doi]\\nAB  - The effects of mild-temperature hyperthermia (MTH) and metformin, alone or in\\n      combination, on the efficacy of high-dose hypofractionated radiation against\\n      experimental tumors were investigated. FSaII fibrosarcoma grown subcutaneously in\\n      the hind legs of C3H mice was irradiated with a single 15 Gy dose using a 60Co\\n      irradiator. The radio frequency capacitive method was used to heat the tumors at \\n      41.0 degrees C for 30 min. Metformin was intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered\\n      daily to tumor-bearing mice at a dose of 150 mg/kg. The expression levels of\\n      hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor \\n      (VEGF), and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) were determined by\\n      immunohistochemical staining of the excised tumor tissues. The apoptosis of tumor\\n      cells in vivo was quantified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick\\n      end labeling (TUNEL) staining and cleaved caspase-3 staining of the excised tumor\\n      tissues. Irradiation of tumors markedly increased the expression of HIF-1alpha,\\n      VEGF, and PD-L1, and MTH and metformin used either alone or in combination\\n      significantly abrogated the radiation-induced upregulation of these proteins. MTH\\n      and metformin alone or combined increased the radiation-induced apoptosis in\\n      tumor cells and enhanced the radiation-induced suppression of tumor growth. The\\n      findings indicated that the increased tumor response to 15 Gy irradiation by MTH \\n      and metformin alone or in combination was due, in part, to the abrogation of the \\n      radiation-induced upregulation of HIF-1alpha and its downstream targets VEGF and \\n      PD-L1.\\nCI  - (c)2022 by Radiation Research Society.

METHODS: 64 PC GCs were assessed for alterations in 409\\n      genes and 30 cases were subjected to transcriptomic profiling of 20,815 genes.\\n      RESULTS: A median of 8.2 mutations per Mb (IQR 6.9-10.4) was found and a tumor\\n      mutational load >10 muts/Mb was significantly associated with patients\\' worse\\n      survival (P=0.0024). The most frequent mutated genes were CDH1 and TP53 (each\\n      32.8%) followed by PIK3CA (10.9%). In 15 samples (23.4%), at least one chromatin \\n      remodelling gene was mutated: KMT2D (5 cases); ARID1A and BAP1 (4 cases each);\\n      EZH2, KMT2A, PBRM1 (1 case each). Eight samples (12.5%) had fusion genes\\n      involving CLDN18 gene. Gene expression profiling identified 4 different clusters:\\n      cluster A associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature;\\n      cluster B associated to proliferative signature and EMT; cluster C correlated to \\n      hedgehog signalling; cluster D showing no enrichment for any of the previous\\n      signatures. Notably, cluster A and B showed a worse prognosis compared with\\n      clusters C and D (P=0.0095). CONCLUSION: integrated genomic and transcriptomic\\n      analysis suggest the existence of 4 molecular subtypes of PC GC with prognostic\\n      significance where EMT features are associated with a worse outcome.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, data on differences in phenotypic characteristics among patients\\n      with a strong family history of IBD are scarce and controversial. The aim of the \\n      study was to compare the phenotypic features of IBD patients with four or more\\n      affected first-degree relatives with sporadic cases of IBD. METHODS: Patients\\n      with familial and sporadic IBD were identified from the institutional IBD\\n      database. IBD patients from families with at least four first-degree affected\\n      relatives were selected for analysis and were compared to non-matched sporadic\\n      cases with IBD chosen randomly. Comparison for type of IBD (Crohn\\'s disease (CD) \\n      vs. ulcerative colitis (UC)), age at onset as well as for disease extent,\\n      behavior, extraintestinal manifestations and indicators of severe disease were\\n      analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with familial IBD (28 CD, seven UC) were \\n      compared to 88 sporadic IBD patients (61 CD, 24 UC and three IBDU). Disease\\n      duration was 10.3 +/- 8.2 in the familial and 8.0 +/- 7.2 years in the sporadic\\n      cases, p=.13. The familial cases were younger at diagnosis (19.3 +/- 8.6 vs. 25.7\\n      +/- 11.8, p=.004). Patients with familial compared to sporadic IBD were\\n      significantly more likely to require steroid treatment (80% vs. 54.5%, p=.009),\\n      biological treatment (94.3%, vs. 63.6%, p<.001) or surgery (25.7%, vs. 11.4%,\\n      p=.048). CONCLUSIONS: IBD with a very strong positive family history is\\n      associated with younger age at onset and a more adverse IBD phenotype compared to\\n      sporadic IBD.\\nFAU - Boaz, Elad\\nAU  - Boaz E\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3181-4723\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of\\n      Jerusalem, Shaare-Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.\\nFAU - Bar-Gil Shitrit, Ariella\\nAU  - Bar-Gil Shitrit A\\nAD  - Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Digestive Diseases\\n      Institute, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.\\nFAU - Schechter, Menachem\\nAU  - Schechter M\\nAD  - Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Digestive Diseases\\n      Institute, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.\\nFAU - Goldin, Eran\\nAU  - Goldin E\\nAD  - Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Digestive Diseases\\n      Institute, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.\\nFAU - Reissman, Petachia\\nAU  - Reissman P\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of\\n      Jerusalem, Shaare-Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.\\nFAU - Yellinek, Shlomo\\nAU  - Yellinek S\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of\\n      Jerusalem, Shaare-Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.\\nFAU - Koslowsky, Benjamin\\nAU  - Koslowsky B\\nAD  - Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Digestive Diseases\\n      Institute, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Scand J Gastroenterol\\nJT  - Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology\\nJID - 0060105\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Crohn\\'s disease\\nOT  - complicated disease\\nOT  - family history\\nOT  - ulcerative colitis\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 11:02\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 11:02 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/00365521.2022.2106153 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Scand J Gastroenterol. 2022 Aug 5:1-5. doi: 10.1080/00365521.2022.2106153.\\n\\nPMID- 35929990\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1557-3265 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1078-0432 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - A randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study of high-dose vitamin C plus \\n      FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab versus FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab in unresectable untreated\\n      metastatic colorectal cancer.\\nLID - CCR-22-0655 [pii]\\nLID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-0655 [doi]\\nAB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of high-dose vitamin C plus FOLFOX\\n      +/- bevacizumab versus FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab as first-line treatment in patients\\n      with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2017 and \\n      2019, histologically confirmed mCRC patients (n = 442) with normal\\n      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase status and no prior treatment for metastatic\\n      disease were randomized (1:1) into a control (FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab) and an\\n      experimental (high-dose vitamin C [1.5 g/kg/d, intravenously for 3 hours from D1 \\n      to D3] plus FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab) group. Randomization was based on the primary\\n      tumor location and bevacizumab prescription. RESULTS: The progression-free\\n      survival (PFS) of the experimental group was not superior to the control group\\n      (median PFS, 8.6 vs 8.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval \\n      [CI], 0.70-1.05; P = 0.1). The objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival\\n      (OS) of the experimental and control group were similar (ORR, 44.3% vs 42.1%; P =\\n      0.9; median OS, 20.7 vs 19.7 months; P = 0.7). Grade 3 or higher\\n      treatment-related adverse events occurred in 33.5% and 30.3% of patients in the\\n      experimental and control group, respectively. In prespecified subgroup analyses, \\n      patients with RAS mutation had significantly longer PFS (median PFS, 9.2 vs 7.8\\n      months; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50-0.91; P = 0.01) with vitamin C added to\\n      chemotherapy than with chemotherapy only. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose vitamin C plus\\n      chemotherapy failed to show superior PFS compared with chemotherapy in mCRC\\n      patients as first-line treatment but may be beneficial in mCRC patients harboring\\n      RAS mutation.\\nFAU -

10.1099/ijsem.0.005470 [doi]\\nAB  - A novel bacterium, designated strain JHSY0214(T), was isolated from the gut of a \\n      Korean limpet, Cellana toreuma. Cells of strain JHSY0214(T) were\\n      Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, yellow-pigmented, non-spore-forming,\\n      non-motile and showed a rod-coccus growth cycle. Phylogenetic analysis based on\\n      16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the strain belonged to the genus\\n      Parasphingorhabdus, and was most closely related to Parasphingorhabdus litoris\\n      KCTC 12764(T) (98.71 %). Strain JHSY0214(T) had two fluoroquinolone-resistance\\n      genes and seven multidrug-resistance efflux pump genes, but did not have\\n      beta-lactamase genes and zinc resistance genes compared with P. litoris KCTC\\n      12764(T). Strain JHSY0214(T) grew optimally at 30 degrees C, pH 7.0 and in the\\n      presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. The predominant cellular fatty acids of strain\\n      JHSY0214(T) were summed feature 8 (C18 : 1 omega6c and/or C18 : 1 omega7c; 41.2\\n      %), summed feature 3 (C16 : 1 omega7c and/or C16 : 1 omega6c; 21 %) and C16 : 0\\n      (18.9 %). The major isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-10. The major polar lipids \\n      were sphingoglycolipid and phosphatidylethanolamine. The genomic DNA G+C content \\n      was 52.8 mol%. Based on phylogenetic, genotypic and phenotypic data, strain\\n      JHSY0214(T) represents a novel species of the genus Parasphingorhabdus, for which\\n      the name Parasphingorhabdus cellanae is proposed. The type strain is JHSY0214(T) \\n      (=KCTC 82387(T)=DSM 112279(T)).\\nFAU - Yoo, Ji-Ho\\nAU  - Yoo JH\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Han, Jeong Eun\\nAU  - Han JE\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Lee, June-Young\\nAU  - Lee JY\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Jeong, Su-Won\\nAU  - Jeong SW\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Jeong, Yun-Seok\\nAU  - Jeong YS\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Lee, Jae-Yun\\nAU  - Lee JY\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Lee, So-Yeon\\nAU  - Lee SY\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Sung, Hojun\\nAU  - Sung H\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Tak, Euon Jung\\nAU  - Tak EJ\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Kim, Hyun Sik\\nAU  - Kim HS\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Kim, Pil Soo\\nAU  - Kim PS\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Choi, Jee-Won\\nAU  - Choi JW\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Kim, Do-Yeon\\nAU  - Kim DY\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Jeong, In Chul\\nAU  - Jeong IC\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Gim, Do-Hun\\nAU  - Gim DH\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Kang, Seo Min\\nAU  - Kang SM\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Biology,\\n      Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.\\nFAU - Bae, Jin-Woo\\nAU  - Bae JW\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Int J Syst Evol Microbiol\\nJT  - International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology\\nJID - 100899600\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Cellana toreuma\\nOT  - Korean seawater clam\\nOT  - Parasphingorhabdus\\nOT  - gut microbiota\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 10:54\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 10:54 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.005470 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2022 Aug;72(8). doi: 10.1099/ijsem.0.005470.\\n\\nPMID- 35929983\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1528-1175 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0003-3022 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Preoperative Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Cryoneurolysis for the Treatment of\\n      Pain following Mastectomy: A Randomized, Participant- and Observer-Masked,\\n      Sham-Controlled Study.\\nLID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000004334 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND.: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryoneurolysis is an analgesic\\n      technique in which a percutaneous probe is used to reversibly ablate a peripheral\\n      nerve(s) using exceptionally low temperature, and has yet to be evaluated with\\n      randomized, controlled trials. Pain following mastectomy can be difficult to\\n      treat, and we hypothesized that the severity of surgically-related pain would be \\n      lower on postoperative day 2 with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with \\n      patients receiving solely standard-of-care treatment. METHODS.: Preoperatively,\\n      participants at 1 enrolling center received a single injection ropivacaine 0.5%\\n      paravertebral nerve block at T3 or T4 and a perineural was catheter inserted.\\n      Participants subsequently had an active or sham ultrasound-guided percutaneous\\n      cryoneurolysis procedure of the ipsilateral T2-T5 intercostal nerves in a\\n      randomized, patient- and observer-masked fashion. Participants all received a\\n      continuous paravertebral block with ropivacaine 0.2% until the early morning of\\n      discharge (usually postoperative day 2). The primary end point was the average\\n      pain level measured using a 0-10 numeric rating scale the afternoon of\\n      postoperative day 2. Participants were followed for 1 year. RESULTS.: On\\n      postoperative day 2, participants who had received active cryoneurolysis (n=31)\\n      had a median [IQR] pain score of 0 [0, 1.4] versus 3.0 [2.0, 5.0] in patients\\n      given sham (n=29): difference (97.5%CI) -2.5 (-3.5, -1.5), P<0.001. There was\\n      evidence of superior analgesia through Month 12. During the first 3 weeks,\\n      cryoneurolysis lowered cumulative opioid use by 98%, with the active group using \\n      0.3 [0, 2.8] mg of oxycodone compared with 15.0 [4.0, 24.0] mg in the sham group \\n      (P<0.001). No oral analgesics were required by any patient between Months 1-12.\\n      After 1 year chronic pain had developed in 1 (3%) active compared with 5 (17%)\\n      sham participants (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS.: Percutaneous cryoneurolysis markedly\\n      improved analgesia without systemic side effects or complications following\\n      mastectomy.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022, the American Society of Anesthesiologists.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationships\\n      of low-grade systemic inflammation and nutritional status with ED severity in men\\n      on dialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study included 71 men on\\n      dialysis. The Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) was used to assess ED. Men\\n      were classified as the mild/moderate (SHIM score >/= 8) and severe ED (SHIM score\\n      </= 7) groups. C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR) and Geriatric Nutritional\\n      Risk Index (GNRI) were used to evaluate low-grade systemic inflammation and\\n      nutritional status, respectively. We performed multivariate analysis to assess\\n      the relationships of CAR and GNRI with severe ED. RESULTS: The median age of the \\n      included men was 64 years old. All men had any degree of ED with 65% having\\n      severe ED. In the univariate analyses, a significant association was observed\\n      between elevated CAR (>/= 0.09) and severe ED (odds ratio [OR]: 4.038, P =\\n      0.025), whereas no significant association was observed between lower GNRI (< 92)\\n      and severe ED (OR: 2.357, P = 0.109). In the multivariate analysis, an\\n      association between elevated CAR and severe ED was still significant (OR: 5.985, \\n      P = 0.010). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Low-grade systemic inflammation was\\n      significantly associated with ED severity, whereas lower GNRI was not. These\\n      results may be helpful for further research to identify the optimal treatment for\\n      men suffering from severe ED. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: We conducted a single-center prospective cohort study,\\n      enrolling patients from June 2016 to September 2020. The patients underwent\\n      malnutrition risk assessments upon admission. The patients were classified into\\n      five clinical stages according to portal hypertension. The malnutrition risk was \\n      scored using the Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing Tool (RFH-NPT) and \\n      validated by the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) or Liver Disease\\n      Undernutrition Screening Tool (LDUST). Routine clinical laboratory measurements\\n      were performed to calculate the MLR, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class, and model\\n      for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. The patients were followed up for 2\\n      years. RESULTS: Among the 154 patients with cirrhosis, 60 had compensated\\n      cirrhosis and 94 had decompensated cirrhosis. The optimal cutoff value of the\\n      MLR, >0.4, was effective in predicting malnutrition related to death or liver\\n      transplantation. Those with a high malnutrition risk defined by the NRS-2002 or\\n      RFH-NPT had a higher MLR than those with a low malnutrition risk. For patients\\n      with class A CTP cirrhosis or a MELD score of <10, an MLR cutoff of <0.4\\n      significantly distinguished more patients with a low malnutrition risk than those\\n      with a high malnutrition risk. Both the RFH-NPT score and MLR increased\\n      significantly across the decompensated cirrhosis substages. Interestingly, the\\n      MLR exhibited a positive correlation with the RFH-NPT score until varices\\n      appeared, but the correlation was the highest at the substage of a history of\\n      variceal bleeding (r = 0.714, P = 0.009).

The purpose of\\n      this study was to assess cognitive reserve among centenarians and octogenarians\\n      and to evaluate a process model of cognitive reserve. METHODS: A total of 321\\n      centenarians and octogenarians from the Georgia Centenarian Study were included\\n      in this study. Cognitive reserve components included level of education,\\n      occupational responsibility, current social engagement, past engaged lifestyle,\\n      and activity. Cognitive functioning was measured with the Mini-Mental Status\\n      Examination. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling was computed, and the overall \\n      model fit well, chi2 (df = 3) = 5.02, p = .17; CFI = .99, RMSEA = .05. Education \\n      is directly and indirectly related to cognitive functioning through occupational \\n      responsibility and past engaged lifestyle. Current social engagement is related\\n      to cognitive functioning directly and indirectly through current activities. The \\n      four direct predictors (i.e., education, current social engagement, current\\n      activity, and past engaged lifestyle) explained 35% of the variance in cognitive \\n      functioning. CONCLUSION: The results provide important information for cognitive \\n      reserve theories with implications for interventions that build cognitive\\n      reserve.\\nFAU - Martin, Peter\\nAU  - Martin P\\nAD  - Human Development and Family Sudies, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA.\\nFAU - Gondo, Yasuyuki\\nAU  - Gondo Y\\nAD  - Clincal Thanatology and Geriatric Behavioral Science, Osaka University, Osaka,\\n      Japan.\\nFAU - Lee, Gina\\nAU  - Lee G\\nAD  - Human Development and Family Sudies, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA.\\nFAU - Woodard, John L\\nAU  - Woodard JL\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-9196-3336\\nAD  - Psychology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.\\nFAU - Miller, Steven\\nAU  - Miller S\\nAD  - Psychology and Gerontology, University of Georgia, Athens, Alabama, USA.\\nFAU - Poon, Leonard W\\nAU  - Poon LW\\nAD  - Psychology and Gerontology, University of Georgia, Athens, Alabama, USA.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Exp Aging Res\\nJT  - Experimental aging research\\nJID - 7603335\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 10:53\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 10:53 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/0361073X.2022.2106717 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Exp Aging Res. 2022 Aug 5:1-13. doi: 10.1080/0361073X.2022.2106717.\\n\\nPMID- 35929961\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1364-6893 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0144-3615 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - A before and after study of the impact of simulation training on practitioner\\n      confidence in complex operative deliveries.\\nPG  - 1-7\\nLID - 10.1080/01443615.2022.2107899 [doi]\\nAB  - The aim of this before and after study was to evaluate the efficacy of a complex \\n      operative obstetrics course in improving practitioner confidence. The course\\n      covered rotational instrumental vaginal delivery, vaginal breech delivery,\\n      cervical cerclage, management of postpartum haemorrhage, and complex caesarean\\n      section. Participants filled in a pre- and postcourse questionnaire using a\\n      Likert scale to rate confidence from 1 (not confident) to 5 (very confident) in\\n      15 key skills. Data were analysed using a two-sample t-test for comparison of\\n      means. Data were collected from 67 participants. Practitioner confidence\\n      increased across all skills studied. The largest increases in mean confidence\\n      scores were seen in classical caesarean section (score increase 2.45; p < 0.05)\\n      and management of head entrapment at breech (score increase 2.24; p < 0.05). The \\n      course was successful in improving practitioner confidence across a range of\\n      obstetric skills.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject?\\n      Team-based training for obstetric emergencies has been shown to improve\\n      practitioner knowledge, team behaviours and patient outcomes. Simulation training\\n      in operative vaginal delivery improves operator technique and reduces adverse\\n      outcomes for mothers and babies.What do the results of this study add? Hands-on\\n      simulator training in complex operative obstetrics improves practitioner\\n      confidence in managing a range of obstetric emergencies including those less\\n      frequently encountered. These include rotational instrumental delivery, vaginal\\n      breech delivery, complex caesarean section, postpartum haemorrhage and cervical\\n      cerclage.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or\\n      future research? This study supports the increased use of simulation in advanced \\n      obstetric training with an easily replicated cost efficient course.

We aimed to assess if\\n      there were delays and treatment changes in a cohort of epithelial ovarian cancer \\n      patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of epithelial ovarian cancer patients\\n      included cases diagnosed during the first 22 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in\\n      the state of Sao Paulo and those diagnosed in the 22 months preceding the\\n      outbreak. Time-to-treat was measured in days. In each group, surgery and\\n      chemotherapy proportions were assessed according to healthcare insurance status. \\n      RESULTS: A 56.2% reduction in epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis was identified \\n      during the pandemic group compared to the prepandemic group; fewer patients were \\n      diagnosed in stage I (p < 0.01). Time-to-treat increased from 18.9 to 23 days (p \\n      < 0.01). Surgery in the public sector fell from 74.6% to 65.3% during the\\n      pandemic, compared to 87.1% to 68.8% in the private sector. CONCLUSION: There\\n      were fewer overall diagnoses, reduced stage I diagnosis, increased time-to-treat,\\n      and a reduction in the proportion of patients submitted to surgery.

RESULTS: The\\n      child, his mother and sister had common manifestations such as delayed mental and\\n      motor development, poor exercise tolerance, easy fatigue and paroxysmal dystonia,\\n      but the difference was that the child and his mother had microcephaly and\\n      seizures, while his sister did not.

METHODS: The proband\\n      was screened for variant of 96 cardiomyopathy-associated genes by exonic\\n      amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Candidate variant was verified by\\n      Sanger sequencing among 300 healthy controls as well as family members of the\\n      proband. Co-segregation analysis of genotypes and clinical phenotypes was carried\\n      out for the pedigree. Clustal X software was used to analyze the sequence\\n      conservation of the variant among various species, and its pathogenicity was\\n      predicted by using bioinformatics software. RESULTS: 6 out of 12 members from\\n      this pedigree were found to harbor heterozygous c.4124A>G (p.Tyr1375Cys) variant \\n      of the MYH7 gene, among whom five were diagnosed with HCM. The remaining one had \\n      failed to meet the diagnostic criteria for HCM, but had abnormal ECG. The same\\n      variant was not found in the 300 healthy controls. Amino acid sequence analysis\\n      showed that the variant is located in a highly conserved region, and\\n      bioinformatics analysis predicted that this variant may affect protein function\\n      and has a deleterious effect. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics\\n      and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, the variant was predicted to be likely pathogenic\\n      (PM2+ PP1_Moderate+PP3+PP5).

Prenatal diagnosis was provided to her mother\\n      by chorionic villi sampling (CVS) upon her subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: The\\n      proband, a 4-month-old female infant, had manifested drowsiness, hypotonia and\\n      apathy. Urine metabolism screening showed elevated N-acetylaspartic acid. Cranial\\n      magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal myelination and multiple abnormal\\n      signals in large brain areas.

We found higher REG4 expression in ovarian\\n      cancer than in normal tissues (p < .05). Regenerating gene 4 expression was\\n      negatively associated with overall, progression-free or post-progression survival\\n      rates of patients with ovarian cancer receiving platinum or paclitaxel treatment \\n      (p < .05) according to a Kaplan-Meier plotter. Regenerating gene 4 overexpression\\n      resulted in either cisplatin or paclitaxel resistance, and apoptosis resistance\\n      in CAOV3 ovarian cancer cells (p < .05). REG4-transfected ovarian cancer cells\\n      showed stronger migration and invasion treated with cisplatin or paclitaxel (p < \\n      .05). Additionally, cisplatin or paclitaxel exposure led to the overexpression of\\n      phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p-PI3K), p-Akt, phosphorylated\\n      mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), glutathione S-transferase-pi, survivin,\\n      and B-cell lymphoma 2 in REG4 transfectants compared with control cells (p <\\n      .05). These findings suggested that REG4 expression was up-regulated in ovarian\\n      cancer, and associated with poor survival and chemotherapy resistance. REG4\\n      promoted the occurrence, development, and chemotherapy resistance of ovarian\\n      cancer by regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion, and \\n      PI3K/Akt/m-TOR signalling pathways. IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this\\n      subject? REG4 mRNA expression is up-regulated in many digestive cancers. High\\n      REG4 expression was associated with an adverse prognosis, high tumour and nodal\\n      stages, poor differentiation, and hepatic and peritoneal metastases of digestive \\n      cancers. REG4 expression conferred cancer cells with increased resistance to\\n      chemoradiotherapy, especially 5-FU-based treatment, by activating the\\n      MAPK/Erk/Bim signalling pathway.What do the results of this study add? REG4 was\\n      highly expressed in ovarian cancer. The expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR,\\n      GST-pi, survivin, and Bcl-2 was increased in REG4-overexpressing cells. High REG4\\n      expression was significantly associated with inferior OS, PFS, and PPS rates in\\n      patients with ovarian cancer receiving platinum chemotherapy. REG4 mediated\\n      cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in CAOV3 ovarian cancer cells. The percentage\\n      of apoptotic cells was markedly lower in REG4-transfected compared to\\n      mock-transfected cells after cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment.What are the\\n      implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?\\n      This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of REG4 expression in\\n      ovarian cancer treated with platinum and paclitaxel, to explore REG4\\n      chemoresistance mechanisms to platinum and paclitaxel, and to provide a\\n      scientific experimental basis for the clinical treatment and outcome evaluation\\n      of ovarian cancer. In order to provide comprehensive clinical treatment of\\n      ovarian cancer, it is helpful to improve our understanding of multi-drug\\n      resistance and identify new cancer diagnostic biomarkers.\\nFAU - Xiang, Li-Wei\\nAU  - Xiang LW\\nAD  - Department of Oncology and Experimental Center, The Affiliated Hospital of\\n      Chengde Medical University, Chengde, China.\\nFAU - Xue, Hang\\nAU  - Xue H\\nAD  - Department of Oncology and Experimental Center, The Affiliated Hospital of\\n      Chengde Medical University, Chengde, China.\\nFAU - Ha, Min-Wen\\nAU  - Ha MW\\nAD  - Cancer Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical University,\\n      Jinzhou, China.\\nFAU - Yu, Da-Yong\\nAU  - Yu DY\\nAD  - Department of Cell Biology, Basic Medicine College of Chengde Medical University,\\n      Chengde, China.\\nFAU - Xiao, Li-Jun\\nAU  - Xiao LJ\\nAD  - Department of Immunology, Basic Medicine College of Chengde Medical University,\\n      Chengde, China.\\nFAU - Zheng, Hua-Chuan\\nAU  - Zheng HC\\nAD  - Department of Oncology and Experimental Center, The Affiliated Hospital of\\n      Chengde Medical University, Chengde, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - J Obstet Gynaecol\\nJT  - Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of\\n      Obstetrics and Gynaecology\\nJID - 8309140\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Ovarian cancer\\nOT  - REG4\\nOT  - chemoresistance\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 10:43\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 10:43 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/01443615.2022.2106834 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Obstet Gynaecol. 2022 Aug 5:1-9. doi: 10.1080/01443615.2022.2106834.\\n\\nPMID- 35929917\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1532-7604 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1088-8705 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Ordinal or visual analogue scales for assessing aspects of broiler chicken\\n      welfare?\\nPG  - 1-11\\nLID - 10.1080/10888705.2022.2105648 [doi]\\nAB  - When the gradation of animal welfare is scored through ordinal scales and\\n      equidistant tags are used, empirical data between tags tend to be\\n      non-equidistant.

In humans, tendon\\n      injuries, especially chronic tendinopathy, are very common and the patellar\\n      tendon is a frequent location for tendinopathy or injuries. The biomechanical\\n      characteristics of the patellar tendon, such as elasticity and stiffness, are of \\n      paramount importance and constitute major outcome measures in research studies.\\n      We aimed to assess whether the stiffness of the healthy ovine patellar tendon\\n      changes with age and weight in a population of normal animals. Sixty-eight\\n      \\'patella-patellar tendon-tibial tuberosity\\' units from thirty-four Ile-de-France \\n      ewes of body mass 65 to 95 kg, euthanized for reasons other than musculoskeletal \\n      diseases, underwent a tensile test providing a measure of the tendon stiffness.\\n      Animals were sorted into three categories of age (1-2 yo, 3-5 yo, 6-10 yo).

PURPOSE: To predict\\n      Notch signaling using multiparametric (mp) MRI radiomics and correlate with\\n      biological characteristics in gliomas. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: A\\n      total of 63 patients for model construction and 47 patients from two public\\n      databases for external testing. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 1.5 T and 3.0 T,\\n      T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2WI, T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR),\\n      contrast-enhanced (CE)-T1WI. ASSESSMENT: Radiomic features were extracted from\\n      CE-T1WI, T1WI, T2WI, and T2FLAIR and imaging signatures were selected using a\\n      least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Diagnostic performance was\\n      compared between single modality and a combined mpMRI radiomics model. A\\n      radiomic-clinical nomogram was constructed incorporating the mpMRI radiomic\\n      signature and Karnofsky Performance score. The performance was validated in the\\n      test set. The radiomic signatures were correlated with immunohistochemistry (IHC)\\n      analysis of downstream Notch pathway components. STATISTICAL TESTS: Receiver\\n      operating characteristic curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), Pearson\\n      correlation, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. A P value < 0.05 was considered\\n      statistically significant. RESULTS: The radiomic signature derived from the\\n      combination of all sequences numerically showed highest area under the curve\\n      (AUC) in both training and external test sets (AUCs of 0.857 and 0.823). The\\n      radiomics nomogram that incorporated the mpMRI radiomic signature and KPS status \\n      resulted in AUCs of 0.891 and 0.859 in the training and test sets. The\\n      calibration curves showed good agreement between prediction and observation in\\n      both sets (P= 0.279 and 0.170, respectively). DCA confirmed the clinical\\n      usefulness of the nomogram. IHC identified Notch pathway inactivation and the\\n      expression levels of Hes1 correlated with higher combined radiomic scores (r =\\n      -0.711) in Notch1 mutant tumors. DATA CONCLUSION: The mpMRI-based radiomics\\n      nomogram may reflect the intratumor heterogeneity associated with downstream\\n      biofunction that predicts Notch signaling in a noninvasive manner.

Conclusion: Despite lower \\n      body weight, thyrotoxicosis is associated with insulin resistance. High levels of\\n      thermogenic hormones, leptin, and FGF21 were observed in thyrotoxicosis and may\\n      be partly responsible for the excessive heat production typical of this\\n      condition.\\nFAU - Patil, Avinash\\nAU  - Patil A\\nAD  - Department of Medicine, Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences, Huballi, India.\\nFAU - Vaikkakara, Suresh\\nAU  - Vaikkakara S\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, All India Institute of Medical\\n      Sciences, Mangalagiri, India, sureshvdrsmailbox@rediffmail.com.\\nFAU - Dasari, Mani Deepthi\\nAU  - Dasari MD\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Chinmaya Mission Hospital, Bangalore, India.\\nFAU - Ganta, Sandeep\\nAU  - Ganta S\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Kamineni Hospital, Hyderabad, India.\\nFAU - Sachan, Alok\\nAU  - Sachan A\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences,\\n      Tirupati, India.\\nFAU - Vinapamula, Kiranmayi S\\nAU  - Vinapamula KS\\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry, Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences,\\n      Tirupati, India.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220804\\nPL  - Brazil\\nTA  - Arch Endocrinol Metab\\nJT  - Archives of endocrinology and metabolism\\nJID - 101652058\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Thyrotoxicosis\\nOT  - adiponectin\\nOT  - body composition\\nOT  - fibroblast growth factor 21\\nOT  - insulin resistance\\nOT  - leptin, ghrelin\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 10:43\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 10:43 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 2359-3997000000511 [pii]\\nAID - 10.20945/2359-3997000000511 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Arch Endocrinol Metab. 2022 Aug 4. pii: 2359-3997000000511. doi:\\n      10.20945/2359-3997000000511.\\n\\nPMID- 35929904\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2359-4292 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2359-3997 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 4\\nTI  - Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein alterations in children and\\n      adolescents from Brazil: a prevalence meta-analysis.\\nLID - 10.20945/2359-3997000000508 [doi]\\nLID - 2359-3997000000508 [pii]\\nAB  - Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of total\\n      cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) alterations in children and\\n      adolescents in Brazil.

Subjects and \\n      methods: Cross-sectional study of patients with EPP and control group. All\\n      individuals were submitted to FAST1.2, which combines the FAST1 protocol\\n      developed by our group with 3D T2DRIVE imaging. Results: We evaluated 36\\n      individuals with EPP and 78 as control group. Pituitary stalk (PS) was identified\\n      in 7/36 patients in EPP group by FAST1, and in 24/36 patients in FAST1.2 (p <\\n      0.001). FAST1 failed to detect PS in one individual in the control group, while\\n      the FAST1.2 defined the PS in all individuals. In EPP group, eleven had\\n      interhypothalamic adhesion (IHA), three septo-optic dysplasia, and one cerebellar\\n      malformation. We didn\\'t observe higher frequency of panhypopituitarism or\\n      developmental delay in patients with IHA. In control group, three had pars\\n      intermedia cysts, one hydrocephalus, and one hypothalamic hamartoma. Conclusion: \\n      FAST1.2 allows confident recognition of midline structural abnormalities,\\n      including the pituitary stalk and IHA, thereby making MRI acquisition faster and \\n      with no need for contrast administration. IHA could be associated with defects in\\n      neuronal migration, as occur in patients with EPP, with no clinical significance.\\nFAU - Lyra, Arthur\\nAU  - Lyra A\\nAD  - Unidade de Endocrinologia Pediatrica, Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericordia de \\n      Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.\\nFAU - de Faria Guimaraes, Daniel\\nAU  - de Faria Guimaraes D\\nAD  - Departamento de Radiologia, Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericordia de Sao Paulo,\\n      Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.\\nFAU - Meira, Altino Sa\\nAU  - Meira AS\\nAD  - Departamento de Radiologia, Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericordia de Sao Paulo,\\n      Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.\\nFAU - Peixoto, Guilherme Vieira\\nAU  - Peixoto GV\\nAD  - Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Santa Casa de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.\\nFAU - Sousa E Silva, Tatiane\\nAU  - Sousa E Silva T\\nAD  - Unidade de Endocrinologia Pediatrica, Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericordia de \\n      Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.\\nFAU - Longui, Carlos Alberto\\nAU  - Longui CA\\nAD  - Unidade de Endocrinologia Pediatrica, Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericordia de \\n      Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.\\nAD  - Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Santa Casa de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.\\nFAU - Kochi, Cristiane\\nAU  - Kochi C\\nAD  - Unidade de Endocrinologia Pediatrica, Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericordia de \\n      Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil, ckochi@outlook.com.\\nAD  - Faculdade de Ciencias Medicas, Santa Casa de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.\\nFAU - da Rocha, Antonio Jose\\nAU  - da Rocha AJ\\nAD  - Departamento de Radiologia, Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericordia de Sao Paulo,\\n      Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220804\\nPL  - Brazil\\nTA  - Arch Endocrinol Metab\\nJT  - Archives of endocrinology and metabolism\\nJID - 101652058\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Pituitary gland\\nOT  - growth hormone deficiency\\nOT  - panhypopituitarism\\nOT  - pituitary diseases\\nOT  - posterior pituitary disease\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 10:43\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 10:43 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 2359-3997000000505 [pii]\\nAID - 10.20945/2359-3997000000505 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Arch Endocrinol Metab. 2022 Aug 4. pii: 2359-3997000000505. doi:\\n      10.20945/2359-3997000000505.\\n\\nPMID- 35929901\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2359-4292 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2359-3997 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 4\\nTI  - Normal ambulatory blood pressure in young adults with 21-hydroxylase enzyme\\n      deficiency undergoing glucocorticoid replacement therapy.\\nLID - 10.20945/2359-3997000000504 [doi]\\nLID - 2359-3997000000504 [pii]\\nAB  - Objective: Herein, we compared ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) between young\\n      adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase enzyme\\n      (21OHase) deficiency and a control group.

METHODS: This prospective observational study included\\n      38 KC eyes that underwent epithelium-on CXL. Thirty-three eyes of 33 stable KC\\n      patients with no prior CXL treatment formed the KC group and 35 eyes of 35\\n      healthy volunteers were recruited as the control group. All participants were\\n      evaluated by Schirmer I test, first and average noninvasive tear break-up time\\n      (NITBUT), ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire, and meibography\\n      scores. The CXL patients were evaluated preoperatively and at the 1st, 3rd, and\\n      6th months, and participants without any intervention (KC and control groups)\\n      were evaluated initially, at 1st, 3rd, and 6th months. RESULTS: The KC patients\\n      had significantly lower average NITBUT, higher OSDI scores, and impaired\\n      meibomian gland morphology than healthy individuals (NITBUT(seconds): KC,\\n      12.8(2.4-17.6), healthy group (HG), 17.1(6.8-17.6); p = 0.012, OSDI: KC,\\n      27.5(0.0-87.5), HG, 7.5(0.0-55.0); p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). A\\n      significant difference was found in Schirmer values of the CXL group at 0-1st\\n      months, first NITBUT values at 1-6 months, and average NITBUT values at 1-3 and\\n      1-6 months (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, p = 0.003, p = 0.001, respectively). All\\n      meibography parameters remained unchanged after CXL over a 6-month follow-up\\n      compared to initial measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the KC patients had\\n      lower NITBUT, higher OSDI scores, and increased meibomian gland disfunction, the \\n      CXL treatment did not significantly affect tear quantity, dry eye symptoms, and\\n      meibomian gland morphology.\\nFAU - Akgoz, Hasan\\nAU  - Akgoz H\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1115-8359\\nAD  - 175650Recep Tayyip Erdogan University, Merkez/Rize, Turkey.\\nFAU - Findik, Huseyin\\nAU  - Findik H\\nAD  - 175650Recep Tayyip Erdogan University, Merkez/Rize, Turkey.\\nFAU - Aslan, Mehmet Gokhan\\nAU  - Aslan MG\\nAD  - 175650Recep Tayyip Erdogan University, Merkez/Rize, Turkey.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Eur J Ophthalmol\\nJT  - European journal of ophthalmology\\nJID - 9110772\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Crosslinking\\nOT  - OSDI\\nOT  - keratoconus\\nOT  - meibography\\nOT  - tear break-up time\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 10:42\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 10:42 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1177/11206721221118740 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Eur J Ophthalmol. 2022 Aug 5:11206721221118740. doi: 10.1177/11206721221118740.\\n\\nPMID- 35929881\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2149-3235 (Print)\\nIS  - 2149-3235 (Linking)\\nVI  - 46\\nIP  - 4\\nDP  - 2020 Jul\\nTI  - COVID-19 outbreak and the impact on renal disorders: A rapid review.\\nPG  - 253-261\\nLID - 10.5152/tud.2020.20179 [doi]\\nAB  - In this rapid review, we aimed to evaluate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019\\n      (COVID-19) on renal functions and mortality of patients with kidney diseases. We \\n      searched MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, UpToDate,\\n      and TRIP databases using the following keywords: COVID-19, COVID19, 2019-nCoV,\\n      2019-CoV, coronavirus, SARS-nCoV-2, urology, cancer, bladder, prostate, kidney,\\n      trauma, stone, neurogenic, and reconstructive. The initial search resulted in 495\\n      records. After the primary screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts and\\n      removing duplicates, 10 articles were selected and included in this rapid review.\\n      Moreover, we performed meta-analysis of binary data for the outcomes with\\n      sufficient data. Owing to a high level of heterogeneity because of different\\n      study designs and contexts, we used a random model for the meta-analysis. Only 5 \\n      studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. In these studies, comprising 964\\n      COVID-19 positive patients, the cumulative event rate of acute kidney injury\\n      (AKI) was 7.1% (95% confidence interval: 1.8%-24.5%, p<0.001, I2=92.4).

Data regarding subjective (International Consultation \\n      on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence [ICIQ-UI] and International \\n      Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Overactive Bladder [ICIQ-OAB]) and\\n      objective (stress test and bladder diary) outcomes and complication rates were\\n      evaluated. Primary outcomes were objective (negative pad and stress test) and\\n      subjective (no leakage episodes) success after a median follow-up of 24 months.\\n      RESULTS: PVDF slings demonstrated a high level of satisfaction with objective\\n      cure (transobturator 90% compared with retropubic 100%, P = .90), urgency to\\n      urinate, frequency of de novo incontinence (transobturator 90% compared with\\n      retropubic 80%, P = .85), ability of physical and sexual activity (transobturator\\n      90% compared with retropubic 100%, P = .90). The multivariate logistic regression\\n      model for satisfaction was associated with overall treatment success (odds ratio \\n      [OR] = 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.32-6.1), greater reduction in ICIQ-UI\\n      (OR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.78-1.85) and ICIQ-OAB (OR =0.99; 95% CI 0.89-1.78).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on\\n      SCI patients with neurogenic bladder. The questionnaires used to assess the QoL\\n      were the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36), the Incontinence\\n      questionnaire [Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6)], the International Index of\\n      Erectile Function (IIEF-5), and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Patients\\n      were categorized into two groups: the first group consisted of patients who\\n      underwent a surgical procedure and the second group included patients managed by \\n      a conservative treatment option: clean intermittent bladder catheterization.\\n      RESULTS: Total of 29 patients included in the study, 13 patients underwent\\n      urinary diversion (mean age: 45.84+/-16.41 years) and 16 patients had a\\n      conservative treatment (mean age: 47.61+/-13.90 years).

This study aimed at evaluating the relationship\\n      between stone size and stone attenuation measured by HU as predictors for the TLE\\n      during the procedure. METHODS: We conducted an observational prospective cohort\\n      study of patients undergoing URS lithotripsy at the Urology department of Ain\\n      Shams University Hospitals from September 2018 to September 2019 with the use of \\n      a holmium YAG laser as the lithotripsy method. Patients\\' demographic and clinical\\n      characteristics, stone location, stone size, stone attenuation measured by HU\\n      from the non-contrast CT, TLE, and procedure time were recorded. Data were\\n      analyzed using Jamovi software (version 2.0 for macOS). RESULTS: Forty patients\\n      were included in the study (22 males and 18 females) with a mean age of 57.8\\n      years. The mean stone size was 9.8 mm(3), the mean HU was 858.8 units, and the\\n      mean TLE was 3.5 KJ. Both stone size and stone attenuation measured by HU were\\n      positively correlated with TLE (r = 0.81 and 0.84, respectively; p < 0.001 for\\n      both). Further, regression analysis showed that both variables could\\n      significantly predict the TLE (ss = 0.001 and 0.71, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:\\n      Both stone attenuation, as measured by HU, and stone size positively correlate\\n      with TLE required for URS lithotripsy. Therefore, both HU and stone size can\\n      predict the TLE, which will be helpful to guide the urologist in selecting the\\n      optimal fiber size for the procedure.\\nFAU - Saad Elsayed, Mohamed\\nAU  - Saad Elsayed M\\nAD  - Department of Urology, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.\\nFAU - Abo Ghareeb, Mohamed Esmat\\nAU  - Abo Ghareeb ME\\nAD  - Department of Urology, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.\\nFAU - Hamed, Hany\\nAU  - Hamed H\\nAD  - Department of Urology, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.\\nFAU - Elmoazen, Mohamed\\nAU  - Elmoazen M\\nAD  - Department of Urology, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.\\nFAU - Shorbagy, Ahmed Amr\\nAU  - Shorbagy AA\\nAD  - Department of Urology, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Scand J Urol\\nJT  - Scandinavian journal of urology\\nJID - 101587186\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Ureteroscopy\\nOT  - holmium laser\\nOT  - lithotripsy\\nOT  - stone\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 10:33\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 10:33 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1080/21681805.2022.2104366 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Scand J Urol. 2022 Aug 5:1-5. doi: 10.1080/21681805.2022.2104366.\\n\\nPMID- 35929854\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1557-9042 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0897-7151 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Telling the Whole Story: Bibliometric Network Analysis to Evaluate Impact of\\n      Media Attention on Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Research.\\nLID - 10.1089/neu.2022.0266 [doi]\\nAB  - There is a national debate regarding the existence of a relationship between\\n      contact sport participation and future risk of neurodegenerative disease.

The mean gestational week and the mean\\n      birthweight were found to be 26,7 +/- 2.2 weeks and 928 +/- 190 g, respectively. \\n      The incidence of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia was significantly higher in\\n      group A (70% vs. 14.3%; P = .019). Post-ligation invasive MV, duration, and\\n      length of stay in the intensive care unit were found to be significantly longer\\n      in group A. None of the patients had hemodynamic disturbances or complications\\n      during and after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Bedside surgical ductus ligation is \\n      a safe procedure. Prolonging pharmacologic treatment in order to avoid surgery\\n      increases the risk of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and prolongs hospital\\n      stay.\\nFAU - Zubarioglu, Adil Umut\\nAU  - Zubarioglu AU\\nAD  - Department of Neonatalogy, Istanbul Yeni yuzyil University School of Medicine,\\n      Istanbul, Turkey.\\nFAU - Yildirim, Ozgur\\nAU  - Yildirim O\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery, Istanbul Yeni yuzyil University\\n      School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.\\nFAU - Zeybek, Cenap\\nAU  - Zeybek C\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Istanbul Yeni yuzyil University School of\\n      Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.\\nFAU - Balaban, Ismail\\nAU  - Balaban I\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Istanbul Yeni yuzyil University School of\\n      Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.\\nFAU - Aliyev, Bahruz\\nAU  - Aliyev B\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Istanbul Yeni yuzyil University School of\\n      Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.\\nFAU - Yazicioglu, Volkan\\nAU  - Yazicioglu V\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery, Istanbul Yeni yuzyil University\\n      School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.\\nFAU - Tutak, Ercan\\nAU  - Tutak E\\nAD  - Department of Neonatology, Istanbul Memorial Sisli Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.\\nFAU - Dursun, Mesut\\nAU  - Dursun M\\nAD  - Department of Neonatology, Istanbul Biruni University School of Medicine,\\n      Istanbul, Turkey.\\nFAU - Turkoglu Unal, Ebru\\nAU  - Turkoglu Unal E\\nAD  - Department of Neonatology, Istanbul Sariyer Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research \\n      Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.\\nFAU - Kara, Nursu\\nAU  - Kara N\\nAD  - Department of Neonatology, Istanbul Suleymaniye Training and Research Hospital,\\n      Istanbul, Turkey.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - Turkey\\nTA  - Turk Arch Pediatr\\nJT  - Turkish archives of pediatrics\\nJID - 101776822\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 10:32\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 10:32 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.5152/TurkArchPediatr.2021.21010 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Turk Arch Pediatr. 2021 Jul;56(4):300-307. doi:\\n      10.5152/TurkArchPediatr.2021.21010.\\n\\nPMID- 35929848\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1364-5498 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1359-6640 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Improved microcanonical instanton theory.\\nLID - 10.1039/d2fd00063f [doi]\\nAB  - Canonical (thermal) instanton theory is now routinely applicable to complex\\n      gas-phase reactions and allows for the accurate description of tunnelling in\\n      highly non-separable systems. Microcanonical instanton theory is by contrast far \\n      less well established. Here, we demonstrate that the best established\\n      microcanonical theory [S. Chapman, B. C. Garrett and W. H. Miller, J. Chem.\\n      Phys., 1975, 63, 2710-2716], fails to accurately describe the deep-tunnelling\\n      regime for systems where the frequencies of the orthogonal modes change rapidly\\n      along the instanton path. By taking a first principles approach to the derivation\\n      of microcanonical instanton theory, we obtain an improved method, which\\n      accurately recovers the thermal instanton rate when integrated over energy. The\\n      resulting theory also correctly recovers the separable limit and can be thought\\n      of as an instanton generalisation of Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory.\\n      When combined with the density-of-states approach [W. Fang, P. Winter and J. O.\\n      Richardson, J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2021, 17, 40-55], this new method can be\\n      straightforwardly applied to real molecular systems.\\nFAU - Lawrence, Joseph E\\nAU  - Lawrence JE\\nAUID- ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6546-2925\\nAD  - Laboratory of Physical Chemistry, ETH Zurich, 8093, Switzerland.\\n      jlawrence@ethz.ch.\\nFAU - Richardson, Jeremy O\\nAU  - Richardson JO\\nAUID- ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9429-151X\\nAD  - Laboratory of Physical Chemistry, ETH Zurich, 8093, Switzerland.\\n      jlawrence@ethz.ch.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Faraday Discuss\\nJT  - Faraday discussions\\nJID - 9212301\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 10:32\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 10:32 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1039/d2fd00063f [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Faraday Discuss. 2022 Aug 5. doi: 10.1039/d2fd00063f.\\n\\nPMID- 35929845\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1879-3479 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0020-7292 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Evaluation of the Role of Intraoperative Frozen Section and Magnetic Resonance\\n      Imaging in Endometrial Cancer.\\nLID - 10.1002/ijgo.14389 [doi]\\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: Histological type, grade, and myometrial invasion are major prognostic\\n      features of endometrial carcinoma since it can alter the decision-making on\\n      surgical procedure. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of preoperative\\n      endometrial biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of endometrial cancer\\n      compared to that of intraoperative frozen section. METHODS: This retrospective\\n      study included 264 patients who underwent surgery with intraoperative frozen\\n      section for endometrial cancer at our institution between 2014 and 2018.\\n      Diagnosis was determined by histological type, grade, and myometrial invasion.\\n      Concordance rate, sensitivity, and specificity of preoperative diagnosis and\\n      intraoperative frozen diagnosis were calculated, in comparison to the final\\n      pathological diagnosis. RESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative diagnoses showed\\n      no statistically significant difference in determining histological type and\\n      grade (p=0.152). Intraoperative diagnosis showed higher sensitivity for\\n      endometrioid carcinoma grade-3 and other types, and higher specificity for\\n      grade-1. For myometrial invasion, intraoperative diagnosis showed significantly\\n      higher concordance rate than preoperative MRI findings (p<0.01). Intraoperative\\n      diagnosis showed higher sensitivity and specificity in patients with and without \\n      myometrial invasion, respectively. CONCLUSION: Higher agreement between\\n      intraoperative and final diagnoses, especially in myometrial invasion, suggests\\n      that intraoperative frozen section is a good indicator for appropriate surgical\\n      procedure decision-making.\\nCI  - This article is protected by copyright.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 4,464 people, including 2,148 males\\n      and 2,316 females, in our study. Subjects were analyzed by sex, obesity, and\\n      T-score subgroups using regression models. RESULTS: We noted a remarkably\\n      positive relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and TBS after the results were\\n      fully adjusted (beta:0.319; 95% CI: 0.145-0.494; P <0.001). T-score analysis\\n      showed that serum 25(OH)D levels were related to TBS in the normal (T-score > -1)\\n      group with 0.311 (95% CI: 0.097-0.525; P = 0.005). However, in the osteopenia\\n      (-2.5 < T-score < -1) and osteoporosis (T-score < -2.5) groups, there was no\\n      significant association between serum 25(OH)D levels and TBS (P > 0.05).\\n      CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that low serum 25(OH)D levels may decrease the\\n      TBS, which represents skeletal microarchitecture and is a fracture risk factor in\\n      individuals with normal T scores.\\nFAU - Yang, Shih-Wei\\nAU  - Yang SW\\nFAU - Lin, Yu-Jen\\nAU  - Lin YJ\\nFAU - Cheng, Yung-Wen\\nAU  - Cheng YW\\nFAU - Chen, Yuan-Yuei\\nAU  - Chen YY\\nFAU - Chen, Wei-Liang\\nAU  - Chen WL\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220804\\nPL  - Poland\\nTA  - Pol Arch Intern Med\\nJT  - Polish archives of internal medicine\\nJID - 101700960\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 10:21\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 10:21 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.20452/pamw.16311 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Pol Arch Intern Med. 2022 Aug 4. doi: 10.20452/pamw.16311.\\n\\nPMID- 35929840\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1945-4589 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1945-4589 (Linking)\\nVI  - 14\\nIP  - undefined\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 4\\nTI  - Influence of cardiovascular risk burden on pulmonary function trajectory: role of\\n      physical and social activities.\\nLID - 10.18632/aging.204201 [doi]\\nAB  - The impact of cardiovascular risk burden on long-term trajectories of pulmonary\\n      function (PF) remains unclear. We examined the association of cardiovascular risk\\n      burden assessed by Framingham general cardiovascular risk score (FGCRS) with PF\\n      decline and explored whether cardiovascular diseases (CVD), physical and social\\n      activities play a role in the association. Within the Rush Memory and Aging\\n      Project, 1,442 participants (mean age:79.83) were followed up to 22 years. FGCRS \\n      at baseline was calculated and categorized into tertiles. Composite PF was\\n      measured annually based on peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in one \\n      second, and forced vital capacity. We found that the highest FGCRS was associated\\n      with faster PF decline (beta: -0.013, 95% CI: -0.023 to -0.003) compared with the\\n      lowest FGCRS. There were significant interactions between higher FGCRS and low\\n      level of physical/social activity (beta: -0.014, 95% CI: -0.026 to -0.003)/(beta:\\n      -0.020, 95% CI:-0.031 to -0.009) or CVD(beta: -0.023, 95% CI:-0.034 to -0.011)\\n      compared to the low FGCRS with high level of physical/social activity or without \\n      CVD (P-interaction<0.05). Our results suggest that higher cardiovascular risk\\n      burden is associated with a faster PF decline, especially among people with CVD. \\n      High level of physical activity and social activity appears to mitigate this\\n      association.\\nFAU - Bai, Yang\\nAU  - Bai Y\\nAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tianjin\\n      Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nAD  - Tianjin Key Laboratory of Environment, Nutrition and Public Health, Tianjin\\n      300070, China.\\nAD  - Center for International Collaborative Research on Environment, Nutrition, And\\n      Public Health, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Jiao\\nAU  - Wang J\\nAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tianjin\\n      Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nAD  - Tianjin Key Laboratory of Environment, Nutrition and Public Health, Tianjin\\n      300070, China.\\nAD  - Center for International Collaborative Research on Environment, Nutrition, And\\n      Public Health, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nFAU - Song, Ruixue\\nAU  - Song R\\nAD  - Shandong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Emergency and Critical Care\\n      Medicine, Institute of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine of Shandong\\n      University, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan 250012, Shandong, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Zhangyu\\nAU  - Wang Z\\nAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tianjin\\n      Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nAD  - Tianjin Key Laboratory of Environment, Nutrition and Public Health, Tianjin\\n      300070, China.\\nAD  - Center for International Collaborative Research on Environment, Nutrition, And\\n      Public Health, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nFAU - Qi, Xiuying\\nAU  - Qi X\\nAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tianjin\\n      Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nAD  - Tianjin Key Laboratory of Environment, Nutrition and Public Health, Tianjin\\n      300070, China.\\nAD  - Center for International Collaborative Research on Environment, Nutrition, And\\n      Public Health, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nFAU - Buchman, Aron S\\nAU  - Buchman AS\\nAD  - Rush Alzheimer\\'s Disease Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.\\nFAU - Bennett, David A\\nAU  - Bennett DA\\nAD  - Rush Alzheimer\\'s Disease Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.\\nFAU - Xu, Weili\\nAU  - Xu W\\nAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tianjin\\n      Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nAD  - Tianjin Key Laboratory of Environment, Nutrition and Public Health, Tianjin\\n      300070, China.\\nAD  - Center for International Collaborative Research on Environment, Nutrition, And\\n      Public Health, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nAD  - Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet,\\n      Stockholm 17177, Sweden.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220804\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Aging (Albany NY)\\nJT  - Aging\\nJID - 101508617\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Framingham general cardiovascular risk score\\nOT  - community-based cohort study\\nOT  - physical activity\\nOT  - pulmonary function\\nOT  - social activity\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 10:13\\nPHST- 2022/03/18 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/21 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 10:13 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 204201 [pii]\\nAID - 10.18632/aging.204201 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Aging (Albany NY). 2022 Aug 4;14(undefined). pii: 204201. doi:\\n      10.18632/aging.204201.\\n\\nPMID- 35929837\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1945-4589 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1945-4589 (Linking)\\nVI  - 14\\nIP  - undefined\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 3\\nTI  - miRNA-338-3p inhibits the migration, invasion and proliferation of human lung\\n      adenocarcinoma cells by targeting MAP3K2.\\nLID - 10.18632/aging.204198 [doi]\\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of micro ribonucleic acid \\n      (miR)-338-3p on the migration, invasion and proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma \\n      (LUAD) cells. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis was employed to evaluate the\\n      function and expression of related genes in lung cancer. Human A549 and NCI-H1299\\n      cells cultured to logarithmic growth stage were assigned to negative control (NC)\\n      mimic group, miR-338-3p mimic group (miR-mimic group), NC inhibitor group and\\n      miR-338-3p inhibitor group (miR-inhibitor group) treated with or without MAP3K2\\n      overexpression (OE)-lentivirus, or TBHQ or FR180204. Transwell assay, cell colony\\n      formation assay, Western blotting and cell-cycle analysis were carried out.\\n      RESULTS: Bioinformatics results manifested that miR-338 and MAP3K2 were involved \\n      in LUAD. The expression levels of MAP3K2, p-ERK1/2, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, cyclin\\n      A2 and cyclin D1 were increased after addition of miR-338-3p inhibitor,\\n      consistent with the raised amount of LUAD cells in migration and invasion\\n      experiments and number of colonies formed, as well as the cell cycle, but\\n      miR-338-3p mimic reversed these results. Moreover, MAP3K2 overexpression elevated\\n      the level of p-ERK1/2. Meanwhile, after treatment with TBHQ or FR180204, the\\n      influence of miR-338-3p inhibitor or mimic was also verified.

If effective, this could pose a promising\\n      alternative for treatment of ruptured aneurysms not amenable to other modalities.\\n      METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase\\n      databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and\\n      Meta-analyzes guidelines. We included articles reporting use of surface-modified \\n      FDs for treatment of ruptured aneurysms. Demographics, subarachnoid hemorrhage\\n      (SAH) severity, aneurysm characteristics, devices used, periprocedural\\n      complications, angiographic outcomes, and mortality were extracted for sample\\n      size-based weighted analysis. RESULTS: Six studies comprising 59 patients with 64\\n      aneurysms were included. Mean patient age was 56.6 +/- 6.3 years and 60.6% (95%\\n      confidence interval [CI], 46.7-72.9%) were women. The anterior circulation was\\n      the location in 60.4% (95%CI, 45.5-73.5%) of aneurysms; 41.8% of the aneurysms\\n      were saccular (95%CI, 29.3-55.4%), 16.7% were fusiform (95%CI, 8.3-30.8%), 29.9% \\n      were dissecting (95%CI, 12.8-55.4%), 24.4% were blood-blister (95%CI,\\n      15.2-36.7%), and 5.7% were mycotic (95%CI, 2-15.1%). Poor SAH grade was reported \\n      in 46.9% (95%CI, 33.3-60.9%). Adjunctive coiling was used in 33.2% (95%CI,\\n      12.4-63.6%). Periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications occurred\\n      in 20% (95%CI, 7.1-45.1%) and 8.8% (95%CI, 3.7-19.5%), respectively. Complete\\n      occlusion was achieved in 76.4% (95%CI, 58.1-88.3%); no retreatments during\\n      follow-up were reported. Overall mortality was 15.1% (95%CI, 7.7-27.6%). There\\n      were no differences between single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) and DAPT regimens \\n      with respect to periprocedural thromboembolic complications (P = 0.09),\\n      hemorrhagic (P = 0.834) complications, and mortality (P = 0.312). CONCLUSION:\\n      Surface-modified FD treatment of ruptured aneurysms resulted in high rates of\\n      thromboembolic complications and acceptable rates of hemorrhagic complications. A\\n      considerable proportion of aneurysms were nonsaccular. Rates of complete\\n      occlusion were high and retreatment were low. Importantly, no statistically\\n      significant difference was found between SAPT and DAPT with respect to\\n      complications and mortality.\\nFAU - Monteiro, Andre\\nAU  - Monteiro A\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, 12291Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical\\n      Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.\\nAD  -

10.1093/bjs/znac225 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Perianal abscess is common. Traditionally, postoperative perianal\\n      abscess cavities are managed with internal wound packing, a practice not\\n      supported by evidence. The aim of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) was to\\n      assess if non-packing is less painful and if it is associated with adverse\\n      outcomes. METHODS: The Postoperative Packing of Perianal Abscess Cavities (PPAC2)\\n      trial was a multicentre, RCT (two-group parallel design) of adult participants\\n      admitted to an NHS hospital for incision and drainage of a primary perianal\\n      abscess. Participants were randomized 1:1 (via an online system) to receive\\n      continued postoperative wound packing or non-packing. Blinded data were collected\\n      via symptom diaries, telephone, and clinics over 6 months. The objective was to\\n      determine whether non-packing of perianal abscess cavities is less painful than\\n      packing, without an increase in perianal fistula or abscess recurrence. The\\n      primary outcome was pain (mean maximum pain score on a 100-point visual analogue \\n      scale). RESULTS: Between February 2018 and March 2020, 433 participants (mean age\\n      42 years) were randomized across 50 sites. Two hundred and thirteen participants \\n      allocated to packing reported higher pain scores than 220 allocated to\\n      non-packing (38.2 versus 28.2, mean difference 9.9; P < 0.0001). The occurrence\\n      of fistula-in-ano was low in both groups: 32/213 (15 per cent) in the packing\\n      group and 24/220 (11 per cent) in the non-packing group (OR 0.69, 95 per cent\\n      c.i. 0.39 to 1.22; P = 0.20). The proportion of patients with abscess recurrence \\n      was also low: 13/223 (6 per cent) in the non-packing group and 7/213 (3 per cent)\\n      in the packing group (OR 1.85, 95 per cent c.i. 0.72 to 4.73; P = 0.20).\\n      CONCLUSION: Avoiding abscess cavity packing is less painful without a negative\\n      morbidity risk.

qsac095 [pii]\\nLID - 10.1093/jaoacint/qsac095 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Several primary aromatic amines (PAAs) have been designated\\n      carcinogenic or suspected of carcinogenicity. Several kinds of PAAs may occur\\n      either via the reduction of azo compounds or as impurities in azo colorants or\\n      other agents. OBJECTIVE: Analytical method was developed and applied to determine\\n      whether certain PAAs are present as impurities in synthetic organic colorants.\\n      METHODS: Target chemicals were analyzed by the ultrasound extraction of the\\n      synthetic organic colorant with a hydrochloric acid solution containing 20%\\n      methanol, followed by conversion from an acidic to alkaline solution, and then\\n      extraction using a diatomaceous earth column. RESULTS: We analyzed certain PAAs\\n      in 38 synthetic organic colorants, resulting in the detection of\\n      2,4-dimethylaniline in 4 samples at 1.2 to 19 mug/g, o-toluidine in 3 samples at \\n      1.0 to 3.4 mug/g, p-phenylazoaniline in 2 samples at 74 to 305 mug/g, and, in one\\n      sample each, 2,4,5-trimethylaniline (13 mug/g), 5-nitro-o-toluidine (12 mug/g),\\n      and 2-methyl-4-(2-tolylazo)aniline (13 mug/g). Nearly all PAAs were determined to\\n      be starting materials for colorant synthesis, although p-phenylazoaniline in\\n      Yellow No. 407 was apparently a byproduct formed during synthesis. For Red No.\\n      225, in which high concentrations of p-phenylazoaniline were detected, additional\\n      samples were purchased from five companies, and p-phenylazoaniline was detected\\n      at concentrations of 88 to 370 mug/g in all samples. CONCLUSION: A method to\\n      analyze certain PAAs contained as impurities in synthetic organic colorants was\\n      developed, and the actual status of them in colorants was clarified. HIGHLIGHTS: \\n      The analytical method developed in this study for the determination of certain\\n      PAAs contained as impurities in synthetic organic colorants may be used to\\n      improve the safety of colorants.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.

We have conducted a subgroup analysis of the multicentre European\\n      DuraGraft registry to investigate clinical event-rates at 1-year in patients with\\n      and without LMCAD undergoing isolated CABG in contemporary practice. METHODS:\\n      Patients undergoing isolated CABG were selected. The primary end-point was the\\n      incidence of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) defined as the composite of\\n      death, myocardial infarction (MI) or repeat revascularization (RR) at 1-year. The\\n      secondary end-point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) \\n      defined as MACE plus stroke. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to\\n      balance for differences in baseline characteristics. RESULTS: LMCAD was present\\n      in 1,033 (41.2%) and absent in 1,477 (58.8%) patients. At 1-year, the MACE rate\\n      was higher for LMCAD patients (8.2% vs 5.1%, p = 0.002) driven by higher rates of\\n      death (5.4% vs 3.4%, p = 0.016), MI (3.0% vs 1.3%, p = 0.002) and numerically\\n      higher rates of RR (2.8% vs 1.8%, p = 0.13). The incidence of MACCE was 8.8% vs\\n      6.6%, p = 0.043 with a stroke rate of 1.0% and 2.4%, p = 0.011, for LMCAD and\\n      non-LMCAD group, respectively. After PSM, the MACE rate was 8.0% vs 5.2%, p =\\n      0.015. The incidence of death was 5.1% vs 3.7%, p = 0.10, MI 3.0% vs 1.4%, p =\\n      0.020, and RR was 2.7% vs 1.6%, p = 0.090, for the LMCAD and non-LMCAD group,\\n      respectively. Less strokes occurred in LMCAD patients (1.0% vs 2.4%, p = 0.017). \\n      The MACCE rate was not different: 8.5% vs 6.7%, p = 0.12. CONCLUSIONS: In this\\n      large registry, LMCAD was demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for MACE \\n      after isolated CABG. Conversely, the risk of stroke was lower in LMCAD patients. \\n      TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02922088.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.

10.1039/d2fo02032g [doi]\\nAB  - A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only available therapy for\\n      coeliac disease (CD). However, GFD compliance is difficult and alternative\\n      strategies are envisaged in the near future. We previously found that wheat\\n      gliadin following transamidation by microbial transglutaminase (mTG) does not\\n      induce IFN-gamma secretion by intestinal T cells from CD patients. Fully\\n      transamidated gliadin with lysine ethyl ester can be recovered in a soluble\\n      protein fraction (spf) generated by the enzymatic treatment of wheat flour.\\n      Herein, we analysed the performance of transamidation by mTG on a pilot-scale\\n      (1L) by evaluating the reaction kinetics and its biological effect on the\\n      intestinal immune response in HLA/DQ8 transgenic mice, a model of gluten\\n      sensitivity. At 1 h, all gliadin fractions showed a faster electrophoretic\\n      mobility by acid-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE) following\\n      transamidation in comparison with their native counterparts. In parallel, the\\n      yield of residual native gliadin dropped (30% at 180 min), confirming our\\n      previous findings on a lab scale. Mucosal sensitisation of mice with gliadin via \\n      the intranasal route induced a Th1 phenotype in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs).\\n      Importantly, IFN-gamma secretion was significantly reduced when gliadin-specific \\n      MLN cells were challenged in vitro with spf (P < 0.001). Multiplex analysis\\n      revealed that the adaptive immune response evoked by spf involved a distinct cell\\n      population characterised by secretion of IL-2, IL-3 and IL-5. Notably, spf\\n      stimulated in vitro a reduced or null secretion of all of the examined\\n      pro-inflammatory markers mainly associated to innate immunity.

Although sperm cannot be ejaculated, the testis maintains sperm\\n      production in vasectomized males. The continuous accumulation of sperm deposited \\n      in the epididymis and the vas deferens fraction necessarily need to be degraded\\n      and eliminated. While the elimination process is carried out by granulomas that\\n      form after vasectomy, the detailed mechanisms of sperm degradation are still not \\n      known. The aim was to assess whether sperm chromatin fragmentation (SCF), a\\n      mechanism that degrades the entire sperm genome at the toroid linker regions\\n      (TLR), is activated after vasectomy in sperm cells. We vasectomized mice and\\n      evaluated the presence of TLR-specific double-strand breaks through pulsed-field \\n      gel electrophoresis and the Comet assay at 1, 2 and 3 weeks after surgery.\\n      Results for DNA damage (Olive tail moment) at single-cell level showed an\\n      increase of double-strand breaks after vasectomy for vas deferens sperm after 1, \\n      2 and 3 weeks post-vasectomy (21.78 +/- 2.29; 19.71 +/- 1.79 and 32.59 +/- 1.81, \\n      respectively), compared to mock surgery (7.04 +/- 1.03; 10.10 +/- 1.29 and 8.64\\n      +/- 0.85, respectively; P < 0.001). Similar findings were obtained for cauda\\n      epididymis sperm (P < 0.001), but not for caput epididymis (P > 0.05).\\n      Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed the presence of double-stranded breaks\\n      between 15 kb and 145 kb, indicating that DNA breaks were produced mainly in the \\n      sperm TLRs. Results presented here suggest that SCF is a mechanism activated in\\n      vas deferens after vasectomy to degrade sperm DNA when they cannot be ejaculated,\\n      preventing their function.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.

ANIMALS: Thirty-eight MUE dogs, 20 hydrocephalic \\n      dogs, 10 brain tumor (BT) dogs, 32 idiopathic epilepsy (IE) dogs, and 41 healthy \\n      dogs. METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records were reviewed to identify\\n      dogs with a diagnosis of neurologic disease. The NLR was determined in all dogs. \\n      RESULTS: The median NLR was significantly higher in MUE dogs (6.08) than in\\n      healthy (1.78, P < .001), IE (2.50, P < .05), and hydrocephalic dogs (1.79, P <\\n      .05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the NLR for\\n      differentiation between MUE and healthy dogs was 0.96, and between the MUE dogs\\n      and dogs with other forebrain diseases was 0.86. An optimal cutoff of 4.16 for\\n      the NLR had a sensitivity of 71.1% and specificity of 83.9% to differentiate the \\n      MUE dogs from the dogs with other forebrain diseases.

This study was\\n      performed to compare the clinical effect and security of the modified posterior\\n      approach (MPA) through the space of the proximal radioulnar joint vs the CLMA for\\n      treatment of TTI. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 76 patients\\n      treated for TTI from January 2009 to December 2020 (MPA: n = 44; CLMA: n = 32).\\n      Treatment involved plate and screw fixation or Steinmann pin fixation for the\\n      radial head and ulnar coronoid process fractures. Surgeons only sutured the\\n      lateral ligament because the medial collateral ligament was usually integrated in\\n      the TTI. The continuous variables were compared by the independent Student t-test\\n      and the categorical variables by the chi(2) -test or Fisher\\'s exact test.\\n      RESULTS: Both groups of patients attained a satisfactory MEPS after the\\n      operation. The MEPS (MPA: 96.82 +/- 6.04 vs CLMA: 96.56 +/- 5.51) was not\\n      significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, the MPA\\n      resulted in better elbow flexion and extension (MPA: 123.98 +/- 10.09 vs CLMA:\\n      117.66 +/- 8.29), better forearm rotation function (MPA: 173.41 +/- 6.81 vs CLMA:\\n      120.00 +/- 12.18), and less intraoperative hemoglobin (MPA: 9.34 +/- 5.64 vs\\n      CLMA: 16.5 +/- 8.75) and red cell volume loss (MPA: 3.09 +/- 2.20 vs CLMA: 6.70\\n      +/- 2.97) (All p < 0.05). Although the CLMA had a shorter surgery time (MPA:\\n      171.73 +/- 80.68 vs CLMA: 130.16 +/- 71.50) (p < 0.05), it had a higher risk of\\n      neurologic damage (MPA: 0 vs CLMA: 4) (p < 0.05). Four patients developed forearm\\n      or hand numbness after the CLMA, but no patients developed numbness after the\\n      MPA. All 76 patients were followed up for 15 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION: \\n      The MPA through the space of the proximal radioulnar joint has more prominent\\n      advantages than the CLMA for TTI, including single scar, clear exposure, good\\n      fixation, lower risk of neurovascular injury, and better elbow joint motion. It\\n      is a safe and effective surgical approach that is worthy of clinical promotion.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

In the VAS_Back,\\n      VAS_Leg, ODI score, LL, SL, HIS, HIF, and CSA of the vertebral canal, the\\n      difference between preoperative and 2 weeks after the operation, 3 months after\\n      the operation, and the last follow-up were statistically significant (P < 0.05). \\n      However, the difference was not statistically significant between each time point\\n      after the operation in the CSA of the vertebral canal, LL, and SL (P > 0.05).\\n      Nonetheless, the difference was statistically significant in ODI between each\\n      time point after the operation (P < 0.05). VAS_Leg was associated with HIS, HIF, \\n      and CSA of the vertebral canal, while LL and SL were risk factors for low back\\n      pain. CONCLUSION: Crenel lateral interbody fusion is an effective procedure in\\n      the management of lumbar ASD. Not only was the postoperative swift recovery due\\n      to minimal invasion, but also adequate LL and SL were achievable.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

This study aimed to identify the clinical\\n      features specific for early-onset rectal cancer and provide insights on cancer\\n      management. METHODS: Early-onset (<50 years) and late-onset (>/=50 years) rectal \\n      cancer patients from a referral tertiary care center (SYSU cohort) and\\n      Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database (SEER cohort) were included to\\n      perform a comprehensive comparison on clinical information. RESULTS: A total of\\n      552 and 80,341 patients with stages I-III rectal cancer were included in the SYSU\\n      and SEER cohorts, respectively. In the SYSU cohort, early-onset diseases had\\n      significantly higher prevalence of family history of cancer and history of HBV\\n      infection and lower incidence of comorbidities (p < 0.05). In addition,\\n      early-onset patients presented more frequently with advanced node stage (N2\\n      stage: 16.9 vs. 9.3%, p = 0.017) and high-risk features, including mucinous or\\n      signet cell carcinomas (21.8 vs. 12.9%, p = 0.014), poorly differentiated tumors \\n      (28.8 vs. 15.4%, p = 0.002), and perineural invasion (14.5 vs. 7.9%, p = 0.027)\\n      compared with late-onset patients. However, early-onset patients received more\\n      neoadjuvant (18.5 vs. 11.2%, p = 0.032) and adjuvant treatments (71.0 vs. 45.8%, \\n      p < 0.001), and they had better overall survival in both SYSU (HR 0.57, 95% CI:\\n      0.34-0.95; p = 0.029) and SEER (HR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.37-0.40; p < 0.001) cohorts.\\n      CONCLUSION: Early-onset rectal cancers are distinct from late-onset cases in\\n      clinicopathological features, treatment modalities, and outcomes. The clinical\\n      trials and studies that are specific for young populations are needed to develop \\n      optimal strategies for cancer screening, treatment, and surveillance.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

CONTEXT: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare aggressive disease with\\n      heterogeneous prognosis. Previous studies identified hypermethylation in the\\n      promoter region of specific genes to be associated with poor clinical outcome.\\n      OBJECTIVE: Comparative analysis of promising hypermethylated genes as prognostic \\n      markers and evaluation of their added value to established clinical prognostic\\n      tools. DESIGN: We included 237 patients with ACCs. Tumor DNA was isolated from\\n      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Targeted pyrosequencing was used\\n      to detect promoter region methylation in 5 preselected genes (PAX5, GSTP1,\\n      PYCARD, PAX6, G0S2). The prognostic role of hypermethylation pattern was compared\\n      to S-GRAS score. Primary endpoints were progression-free (PFS) and overall\\n      survival (OS), with disease-free (DFS) as secondary endpoint. RESULTS: 27.9%,\\n      13.9%, 49%, 49% and 25.3% of cases showed hypermethylation in PAX5, GSTP1,\\n      PYCARD, PAX6, and G0S2, respectively. Hypermethylation in all individual genes - \\n      except GSTP1 - was significantly associated with both PFS and OS - with Hazard\\n      Ratios (HR) between 1.4 and 2.3. However, only hypermethylation of PAX5 remained \\n      significantly associated with OS (p=0.013; HR=1.95, 95%CI 1.2-3.3) in\\n      multivariable analysis. A model for risk stratification was developed, combining \\n      PAX5 methylation status and S-GRAS groups, showing improved prognostic\\n      performance compared to S-GRAS alone (Harrell\\'s C index: OS=0.751, PFS=0.711,\\n      DFS=0.688). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that hypermethylation in PAX5 is\\n      associated with worst clinical outcome in ACC, even after accounting for S-GRAS\\n      score. Assessing methylation in FFPE material is straightforward in the clinical \\n      setting and could be used to improve accuracy of prognostic classification,\\n      enabling the direction of personalized management.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.

METHODS: We\\n      used a prospectively ascertained cohort of patients with GNB-BSI to identify\\n      clinical characteristics, microbiology, and risk factors associated with\\n      recurrent GNB-BSI. Bacterial genotyping (both pulsed field gel electrophoresis\\n      [PFGE] and whole genome sequencing [WGS]) was used to define whether these\\n      episodes were due to relapse or reinfection. Multivariable logistic regression\\n      was used to identify risk factors associated with recurrence. RESULTS: Of the\\n      1423 patients with GNB-BSI that met criteria for inclusion in this study, 60 (4%)\\n      had recurrent GNB-BSI. Non-white race (OR: 2.35; CI95% 1.38-4.01; p = 0.002),\\n      admission to a surgical service (OR: 2.18; CI95% 1.26-3.75; p = 0.005) and\\n      presence of an indwelling cardiac device (OR: 2.73; CI95% 1.21-5.58, p = 0.009)\\n      were associated with increased risk for recurrent GNB-BSI. Among the 48 patients \\n      with recurrent GNB-BSI whose paired bloodstream isolates underwent genotyping,\\n      63% were due to relapse (30/48) and 38% were due to reinfection (18/48) based on \\n      WGS. Compared with WGS, PFGE correctly differentiated relapse and reinfection in \\n      98% (47/48) of cases. Median time to relapse and reinfection was similar (113\\n      days [IQR: 35-222 days] vs. 174 days [IQR: 69-599 days], p = 0.13). Presence of a\\n      cardiac device was associated with relapse (Relapse: 7/27 [26%]; Non-relapse:\\n      65/988 [7%]; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, recurrent GNB-BSI was most\\n      commonly due to relapse. PFGE accurately differentiated relapse from reinfection \\n      when compared with WGS. Presence of a cardiac device was a risk factor for\\n      relapse.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of\\n      Infectious Diseases Society of America.

The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Sl-lncRNA39896 is\\n      induced after P. infestans infection and was previously predicted to act as an\\n      endogenous target mimic (eTM) for the microRNA (miRNA) Sl-miR166b, which function\\n      in stress responses. Here, we further examined the role of Sl-lncRNA39896 and\\n      Sl-miR166b in tomato resistance to P. infestans. Sl-miR166b levels were higher in\\n      Sl-lncRNA39896-knockout mutants than in wild-type plants, and the mutants\\n      displayed enhanced resistance to P. infestans. A six-point mutation in the region\\n      of Sl-lncRNA39896 that binds to Sl-miR166b disabled the interaction, suggesting\\n      that Sl-lncRNA39896 acts as an eTM for Sl-miR166b. Overexpressing Sl-miR166b\\n      yielded a similar phenotype to that produced by Sl-lncRNA39896-knockout, whereas \\n      silencing of Sl-miR166b impaired resistance. We verified that Sl-miR166b cleaved \\n      transcripts of its target class III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes SlHDZ34 and \\n      SlHDZ45. Silencing of SlHDZ34/45 decreased pathogen accumulation in plants\\n      infected with P. infestans. Additionally, jasmonic acid and ethylene contents\\n      were elevated following infection in the plants with enhanced resistance.\\n      Sl-lncRNA39896 is the first known lncRNA to negatively regulate resistance to P. \\n      infestans in tomato. We propose a novel mechanism in which the\\n      lncRNA39896-miR166b-HDZ module modulates resistance to P. infestans. This article\\n      is protected by copyright.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted\\n      of 243 patients with TEXAS grade 3/4 stage D diabetic foot ulcers from December\\n      2016 to December 2019. A total of 115 patients treated with mTTT were classified \\n      as the mTTT group (78 male and 37 female, mean age: 70.4 +/- 6 years) and 128\\n      patients who were treated with ABC combined with mTTT were in the ABC + mTTT\\n      group (89 male and 39 female, mean age: 68.9 +/- 8 years). Follow-up records\\n      during treatment and 6 months after surgery were collected, including the time\\n      required for white blood cells (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to return to\\n      normal range, wound healing time, pain visual analog scale (VAS), ankle-brachial \\n      index (ABI), foot skin temperature, transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement\\n      (TcPO2 ), complications, and other indicators. Normally distributed data were\\n      compared using the independent sample t-test, non-normally distributed data were \\n      analyzed by one-way ANOVA analysis of variance. RESULTS: There were 128 cases in \\n      the ABC + mTTT group (89 male and 39 female, mean age: 68.9 +/- 8 years) treated \\n      with ABC and mTTT, and 115 cases in the TTT group (78 male and 37 female, mean\\n      age: 70.4 +/- 6 years) treated with mTTT alone. The time required for WBC and CRP\\n      to return to the normal range and wound healing time in the ABC + mTTT group were\\n      significantly shorter than those in the mTTT group (12.9 +/- 4.6 vs. 22.6 +/- 1.6\\n      days, t = 3.979, p < 0.001; 25.3 +/- 1.3 vs. 31.3 +/- 2.3 days, t = 4.261, p =\\n      0.001; 11.9 +/- 3.8 vs. 15.9 +/- 3.9 days, t = 4.539, p < 0.001).

METHODS: All craniopharyngioma\\n      surgeries performed at a single institution over a period from January 1st 2001\\n      to October 31th 2017 were evaluated. The electronic medical record was reviewed\\n      for patient factors, tumor characteristics, and cost variables associated with\\n      each hospital stay and univariate regression analysis was performed using R\\n      software. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients met study criteria, including 22\\n      undergoing an open approach and 14 undergoing an EEEA. There was a significantly \\n      longer average length of stay among patients undergoing open resection (21.5 vs. \\n      10.6 days, p = 0.024). The average total in-hospital cost of a patient undergoing\\n      an EEEA was $58979.3 compared to $89142.3 for an open approach (p = 0.127). On\\n      univariate regression analysis, the total in-hospital cost for a patient\\n      undergoing an open approach relative to an EEEA was $30163.0 (p = 0.127). The\\n      open approach was exclusively performed from study onset until April 2010 (16\\n      patients). From April 2010 to August 2013, 6 open approaches and 5 EEEA were\\n      performed. The EEEA has been exclusively performed from August 2013 until the\\n      conclusion of our study period (9 patients). CONCLUSIONS: There has been a shift \\n      toward surgical resection of craniopharyngioma via an EEEA approach for amenable \\n      tumors. Our study demonstrates that the EEEA has become the preferred surgical\\n      approach at our institution, and shows that the EEEA is associated with shorter\\n      postoperative length of stay and lower total in-hospital cost.

Andhra Pradesh\\n      (AP) is a high HIV prevalence state in India, with the second-highest number of\\n      people with HIV (PWH) and a consistent decline in HIV prevalence at the state\\n      level. Probing further into the region and district-wise levels and trends of HIV\\n      prevalence will provide critical insights into sub-regional epidemic patterns.\\n      Hence, this paper analyzes the regional and district-level trends of HIV\\n      prevalence among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics (ANC) from 2003\\n      to 2019 in AP, South India. METHODS: HIV prevalence data collected from pregnant \\n      women in AP during HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) between 2003 and 2019 was used\\n      for trend analysis. The consistent sites were grouped into three regions (Coastal\\n      Andhra, Rayalaseema and Uttar Andhra), totaling 39 sites, including 21 rural and \\n      18 urban sites. Regional and district-level HIV prevalence was analyzed using the\\n      Chi-square trend test, and spatial analysis was done using QGIS software. For the\\n      last three HSS rounds, HIV prevalence based on sociodemographic variables was\\n      calculated to understand the factors contributing to HIV positivity in each\\n      region. RESULTS: In total, 143,211 pregnant women were recruited. HIV prevalence \\n      in AP was 0.30% (95% CI: 0.22 - 0.39) in 2019. The prevalence was 0.31%, 0.35%\\n      and 0.22% in Coastal Andhra, Rayalaseema and Uttar Andhra, respectively. HIV\\n      prevalence had significantly (P < 0.05) declined in all regions. The overall\\n      trend indicated that the HIV prevalence was higher among older pregnant women and\\n      in urban regions. However, recent trends consistently report HIV positivity among\\n      young and new pregnant mothers, illiterates, and rural regions. CONCLUSION: The\\n      overall trend indicated that the HIV prevalence was higher among older pregnant\\n      women and in urban regions. However, recent trends consistently report HIV\\n      positivity among young and new pregnant mothers, illiterates, and rural regions. \\n      Identifying the contextual risk patterns associated with HIV transmission will\\n      further improve HIV preventive and management programs among the general\\n      population.\\nCI  - Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at\\n      epub@benthamscience.net.\\nFAU - Elangovan, Arumugam\\nAU  - Elangovan A\\nAD  - ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.\\nFAU - Santhakumar, Aridoss\\nAU  - Santhakumar A\\nAD  - ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.\\nFAU - Mathiyazhakan, Malathi\\nAU  - Mathiyazhakan M\\nAD  - ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.\\nFAU - Nagaraj, Jaganathasamy\\nAU  - Nagaraj J\\nAD  - ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.\\nFAU - David, Joseph K\\nAU  - David JK\\nAD  - Procrea Fertility Centre, Ontario, Canada.\\nFAU - Ganesh, Balasubramanian\\nAU  - Ganesh B\\nAD  - ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.\\nFAU - Manikandan, Natesan\\nAU  - Manikandan N\\nAD  - ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.\\nFAU - Padmapriya, V M\\nAU  - Padmapriya VM\\nAD  - ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.\\nFAU - Kumar, Pradeep\\nAU  - Kumar P\\nAD  - National AIDS Control Organization, Ministry of Health Family Welfare, Government\\n      of India, New Delhi, India.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - Netherlands\\nTA  - Curr HIV Res\\nJT  - Current HIV research\\nJID - 101156990\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Andhra Pradesh\\nOT  - HIV Sentinel Surveillance\\nOT  - HIV/AIDS\\nOT  - Pregnant Women\\nOT  - Prevalence\\nOT  - Trend\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 07:54\\nPHST- 2022/02/25 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/04/27 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/05/25 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 07:54 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - CHR-EPUB-125353 [pii]\\nAID - 10.2174/1570162X20666220805090501 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Curr HIV Res. 2022 Aug 5. pii: CHR-EPUB-125353. doi:\\n      10.2174/1570162X20666220805090501.\\n\\nPMID- 35929624\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1875-5828 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1567-2050 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Assessing the Influence of Salvia Triloba on Memory Deficit Caused by Sleep\\n      Deprivation in the context of Oxidative Stress.\\nLID - 10.2174/1567205019666220805092450 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Learning and memory deficit has been reported to be correlated to the\\n      oxidative mutilation in the hippocampus. Moreover, sleep deprivation (SD)\\n      mitigates memory via distressing oxidative stress balance. In the current report,\\n      the prospective neuroprotective role of oral sage (Salvia triloba) extract on\\n      cognitive impairment induced by chronic SD was investigated. METHODS: The SD was \\n      induced in adult male Wistar rats employing a modified multiple platform (8\\n      h/day; for six weeks). Simultaneously, S. triloba extract (375 mg/kg, orally) was\\n      administered for six weeks. Thereafter, Radial Arm Water Maze test was utilized\\n      to evaluate the spatial learning and memory. Moreover, activities of different\\n      hippocampal antioxidant parameters: glutathione peroxidase (GPx), oxidized\\n      glutathione (GSSG), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase, superoxide dismutase\\n      (SOD), and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) were measured in\\n      rats\\' hippocampus. Moreover, the level of brain derived neurotrophic factor\\n      (BDNF) was assessed. RESULTS: Current results illustrate that chronic SD\\n      significantly compromised both memories, both short- and long- term, while sage\\n      extract inhibited these consequences. Moreover, sage extract remarkably\\n      stabilized the antioxidants enzyme levels which were decreased by SD such as:\\n      SOD, catalase, and GPx (P < 0.05), and remarkably augmented the GSH/GSSG ratio in\\n      SD rats (P < 0.05). However, no substantial alterations of GSH, TBARS or BDNF\\n      levels (P > 0.05) were seen with sage extract administration. CONCLUSION: Chronic\\n      treatment with sage extract (S. Triloba) precluded SD-induced memory impairment\\n      by regularizing antioxidant parameters levels in rats\\' hippocampus.\\nCI  - Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at\\n      epub@benthamscience.net.\\nFAU - Massadeh, Adnan M\\nAU  - Massadeh AM\\nAD  - Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jordan \\n      University of Science and Technology, P.O.

This study describes the effect\\n      of conditioning regimen intensity on HSCT outcomes among children younger than 14\\n      years with SCD. METHODS: Transplants from HLA-matched related donors (MRD) and\\n      unrelated donors (MUD) using either myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens or \\n      reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens were considered. Event-free\\n      survival (EFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included overall\\n      survival (OS) and occurrence of GVHD. RESULTS: 48 SCD patients underwent HSCT, 45\\n      (93.8%) patients had MRD, 1 (2.1%) had 9/10 related donor, and 2 (4.1%) had MUD. \\n      The median age at transplant was 8.6 years (range, 3.1-13.8). Conditioning\\n      regimens were myeloablative (MAC) in 41 (85.4%) patients and of reduced intensity\\n      in 7 (14.6%) patients. EFS at two years was 100% among MAC group compared to 29% \\n      in the RIC group (P<0.001). The median follow-up was 43.4 months (range\\n      26.8-134). All events in the RIC group were secondary graft failure. However, OS \\n      was 100% in both groups at two years. Acute GVHD II-IV was diagnosed in 2 (4.1%) \\n      patients. Chronic GVHD occurred in 2 (4.1%) patients. GVHD did not occur in\\n      patients who underwent MUD HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: MAC in children with SCD is well\\n      tolerated and associated with an excellent outcome for HLA-matched HSCT in SCD.\\n      There was a high rate of secondary graft failure with the use of RIC. Future\\n      studies are needed to optimize RIC regimens in HSCT of children with SCD. This\\n      article is protected by copyright.

A \\n      complexation-mediated antihyperglycemic and antioxidant synergism between\\n      zinc(II) and p-coumaric acid was investigated. p-Coumaric acid was complexed with\\n      ZnSO4 and characterized by FT-IR, (1) H NMR, and mass spectroscopy. The\\n      antioxidant and antihyperglycemic potential of the complex and precursors were\\n      evaluated with different experimental models. Molecular docking with target\\n      proteins linked to diabetes was performed. A Zn(II)-bicoumarate.2H2 O complex was\\n      formed. The in vitro radical scavenging, alpha-glucosidase inhibitory,\\n      antiglycation, and anti-lipid peroxidative activities of the complex were several\\n      folds stronger than p-coumaric acid. In Chang liver cells and rat liver tissues, \\n      the complex inhibited lipid peroxidation (IC50 = 56.2 and 398 muM) and GSH\\n      depletion (IC50 = 33.9 and 38.7 muM), which was significantly stronger\\n      (2.3-5.4-folds) than p-coumaric acid and comparable to ascorbic acid. Zn(II) and \\n      p-coumaric synergistically modulated (1.7- and 2.8-folds than p-coumaric acid)\\n      glucose uptake in L-6 myotubes (EC50 = 10.7 muM) and rat muscle tissue (EC50 =\\n      428 muM), which may be linked to the observed complexation-mediated increase in\\n      tissue zinc uptake. Glucose uptake activity was accompanied by increased\\n      hexokinase activity, suggesting increased glucose utilization. Docking scores\\n      alpha-glucosidase, GLUT-4, and PKB/Akt showed stronger interaction with the\\n      complex (-6.31 to -6.41 kcal/mol) compared to p-coumaric acid (-7.18 to -7.74\\n      kcal/mol), which was influenced by the Zn(II) and bicoumarate moieties of the\\n      complex. In vitro, the complex was not hepatotoxic or myotoxic. Zn(II)\\n      complexation may be a therapeutic approach for improving the antioxidative and\\n      glycemic control potentials of p-coumaric acid. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In\\n      functional medicine, natural supplements, plant-derived phenolics, and\\n      nutraceuticals are becoming popular in the management of diseases, including\\n      diabetes and oxidative stress. This has been largely attributed to their\\n      perceived holistic medicinal profile and the absence of notable toxicity\\n      concerns. In the past two decades, considerable attention has been drawn toward\\n      zinc mineral as a possible therapeutic supplement for diabetes due to its role in\\n      insulin secretion and reported insulin mimetic potentials. p-Coumaric acid is a\\n      known natural antioxidant with reported diabetes-related pharmacological effects.\\n      In this study, we took advantage of these properties and complexed both natural\\n      supplements, which resulted in a more potent nutraceutical with improved glycemic\\n      control and antioxidant potential. The complexation-mediated synergistic\\n      interaction between zinc and p-coumaric acid could be an important therapeutic\\n      approach in improving the use of these natural supplements or nutraceuticals in\\n      managing diabetes and associated oxidative complications.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\\nFAU - Ramorobi, Limpho M\\nAU  - Ramorobi LM\\nAD  - Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences,\\n      Central University of Technology, Bloemfontein, South Africa.\\nAD  - Centre for Quality of Health and Living (CQHL), Faculty of Health and\\n      Environmental Sciences, Central University of Technology, Bloemfontein, South\\n      Africa.\\nFAU - Matowane, Godfrey R\\nAU  - Matowane GR\\nAD  - Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences,\\n      Central University of Technology, Bloemfontein, South Africa.\\nAD  - Centre for Quality of Health and Living (CQHL), Faculty of Health and\\n      Environmental Sciences, Central University of Technology, Bloemfontein, South\\n      Africa.\\nFAU - Mashele, Samson S\\nAU  - Mashele SS\\nAD  - Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences,\\n      Central University of Technology, Bloemfontein, South Africa.\\nAD  - Centre for Quality of Health and Living (CQHL), Faculty of Health and\\n      Environmental Sciences, Central University of Technology, Bloemfontein, South\\n      Africa.\\nFAU - Bonnet, Susanna L\\nAU  - Bonnet SL\\nAD  - Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, University\\n      of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.\\nFAU - Noreljaleel, Anwar E M\\nAU  - Noreljaleel AEM\\nAD  - Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, University\\n      of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.\\nFAU - Swain, Shasank S\\nAU  - Swain SS\\nAD  - Division of Microbiology & NCDs, ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre,\\n      Bhubaneswar, India.\\nFAU - Makhafola, Tshepiso J\\nAU  - Makhafola TJ\\nAD  - Centre for Quality of Health and Living (CQHL), Faculty of Health and\\n      Environmental Sciences, Central University of Technology, Bloemfontein, South\\n      Africa.\\nFAU - Chukwuma, Chika I\\nAU  - Chukwuma CI\\nAD  - Centre for Quality of Health and Living (CQHL), Faculty of Health and\\n      Environmental Sciences, Central University of Technology, Bloemfontein, South\\n      Africa.\\nLA  - eng\\nGR  - 116701/National Research Foundation, South Africa\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - J Food Biochem\\nJT  - Journal of food biochemistry\\nJID - 7706045\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - antioxidant\\nOT  - complexation\\nOT  - glycemic control\\nOT  - p-coumaric acid\\nOT  - synergism\\nOT  - zinc mineral\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 07:53\\nPHST- 2022/06/24 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/04/01 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/20 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 07:53 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1111/jfbc.14360 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Food Biochem. 2022 Aug 5:e14360. doi: 10.1111/jfbc.14360.\\n\\nPMID- 35929600\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1757-7861 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1757-7853 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Effect of Age on the Patterns of Traumatic Femoral Fractures: Seven Years of\\n      Experience at a Regional Tertiary Hospital.\\nLID - 10.1111/os.13410 [doi]\\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: Femoral fractures are a common cause of mortality and functional loss,\\n      mainly among older people, and there are few studies about the age in relation to\\n      traumatic femoral fractures. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect \\n      of age on the patterns of traumatic femoral fractures in patients presenting to\\n      our regional tertiary hospital. METHODS: The records of 2020 patients who\\n      presented with traumatic femoral fractures between 2013 and 2019 were\\n      retrospectively reviewed. The patients\\' clinical and radiographic records were\\n      reviewed. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify \\n      independent risk factors for associated injuries and complications. RESULTS: The \\n      patients were divided into a child group (CH group, n = 342) aged under 18 years,\\n      a young adult group (YA group, n = 484) aged 18-60 years, and an older people\\n      group (OP group, n = 1194) aged 60 years and over. There were significant\\n      differences among the three groups in several indexes, such as sex ratio (chi(2) \\n      = 301.699, p < 0.001), osteoporosis (chi(2) = 375.463, p < 0.001), injury time of\\n      day (chi(2) = 114.913, p < 0.001), injury cause (chi(2) = 748.187, p < 0.001),\\n      injury location (chi(2) = 490.153, p < 0.001), fracture side (chi(2) = 57.000, p \\n      < 0.001), fracture site (chi(2) = 806.650, p < 0.001), associated injuries\\n      (chi(2) = 322.921, p < 0.001), coma after injury (chi(2) = 147.814, p < 0.001),\\n      non-surgery-related complications (chi(2) = 7.895, p = 0.019), and\\n      surgery-related complications (chi(2) = 82.186, p < 0.001). The YA group had a\\n      significantly higher percentage of patients with surgery-related complications\\n      than the OP group. The OP group had a higher frequency of non-surgery-related\\n      complications than the YA group and CH group. The most common non-surgery-related\\n      complications were pneumonia (7.1%) in the OP group and deep venous thrombosis\\n      (6.4%) in the YA group. Multivariable logistic regression showed that young\\n      adults, high-energy injury, outdoors, coma after injury, and fracture sites\\n      except for the proximal region were independent risk factors for associated\\n      injuries. Older age, male, and fracture site except for the proximal region were \\n      independent risk factors for complications. CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic femoral\\n      fractures are mostly the result of low-energy trauma and predominantly affect the\\n      proximal site of the femur among older people. A higher rate of shaft fractures, \\n      fractures occurring outdoors, and associated injuries were observed among young\\n      adults and children than among older people.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

Specnuezhenide\\n      (SPN) is an active compound with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory\\n      properties. However, the roles of SPN in diabetic osteoporosis remain unknown. In\\n      this study, primary bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were pretreated with SPN and\\n      were stimulated with receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL; \\n      to induce osteoclastogenesis. The number of osteoclasts was detected by\\n      tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. The protein levels of\\n      cellular oncogene fos/nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (c-Fos/NFATc1),\\n      nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)\\n      were evaluated by western blot analysis. NF-kappaB luciferase assays were used to\\n      examine the role of SPN in NF-kappaB activation. The DM model group received a\\n      high-glucose, high-fat diet and was then intraperitoneally injected with\\n      streptozotocin (STZ). Micro-CT scanning, serum biochemical analysis, histological\\n      analysis were used to assess bone loss. We found that SPN suppressed\\n      RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and that SPN inhibited the expression of\\n      osteoclast-related genes and c-Fos/NFATc1. SPN inhibited RANKL-induced activation\\n      of NF-kappaB and MAPKs. In vivo experiments revealed that SPN suppressed\\n      diabetes-induced bone loss and the number of osteoclasts. Furthermore, SPN\\n      decreased the levels of bone turnover markers and increased the levels of\\n      runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osteoprotegerin (OPG), calcium (Ca) \\n      and phosphorus (P). SPN also regulated diabetes-related markers. This study\\n      suggests that SPN suppresses diabetes-induced bone loss by inhibiting\\n      RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, and provides an experimental basis for the\\n      treatment of diabetic osteoporosis.\\nFAU - Ye, Xiaoshuang\\nAU  - Ye X\\nFAU - Jiang, Juanjuan\\nAU  - Jiang J\\nFAU - Yang, Juan\\nAU  - Yang J\\nFAU - Yan, Wenyan\\nAU  - Yan W\\nFAU - Jiang, Luyue\\nAU  - Jiang L\\nFAU - Chen, Yan\\nAU  - Chen Y\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220725\\nPL  - China\\nTA  - Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)\\nJT  - Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica\\nJID - 101206716\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - MAPKs\\nOT  - NF-kappaB\\nOT  - RANKL\\nOT  - bone loss\\nOT  - osteoclastogenesis\\nOT  - specnuezhenide\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 07:43\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 07:43 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3724/abbs.2022094 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2022 Jul 25. doi: 10.3724/abbs.2022094.\\n\\nPMID- 35929591\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1757-7861 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1757-7853 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Comparison of the Outcomes between AO Type B2 Thoracolumbar Fracture with and\\n      without Disc Injury after Posterior Surgery.\\nLID - 10.1111/os.13400 [doi]\\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: The type AO B2 thoracolumbar fracture is a kind of flexion-distraction\\n      injury and the effect of disc injury on treatment results of patients with B2\\n      fracture remains unclear. The objective of the current study was to compare and\\n      analyze the outcomes in AO Type B2 thoracolumbar fracture patients with and\\n      without disc injuries in terms of the Cobb angle of kyphosis, the incidence of\\n      complication, and the rate of implant failure. METHODS: This is a retrospective\\n      study. Of the 486 patients with thoracolumbar fractures who underwent posterior\\n      fixation, 38 patients with AO type B2 injuries were included. All the patients\\n      were divided into two groups according to changes in the adjoining discs. Disc\\n      injury group A included 17 patients and no disc injury group included 21\\n      patients. Clinical and radiologic parameters were evaluated before surgery, after\\n      surgery, and at follow-up. Clinical outcomes included visual analogue scale (VAS)\\n      scores, incidence of complications, and incidence of implant failure. Radiologic \\n      assessment was accomplished with the Cobb angle (CA), local kyphosis (LK),\\n      percentage of anterior vertebral height (AVBH%), intervertebral disc height, and \\n      intervertebral disc angle. Fisher\\'s precision probability tests were employed and\\n      chi square test were used to compare categorical variables. Paired sample t tests\\n      and independent-sample t tests were used to compare continuous data. RESULTS:\\n      Disc injury mainly involved the cranial disc (15/19, 78.9%). The mean follow-up\\n      period for the patients was 30.2 +/- 20.1 months. No neurologic deterioration was\\n      reported in the patients at the last follow-up. Radiological outcomes at the last\\n      follow-up showed significant differences in the CA (18.59 degrees +/- 13.74\\n      degrees vs 8.16 degrees +/- 9.99 degrees , P = 0.008), LK (12.74 degrees +/- 8.00\\n      degrees vs 6.55 degrees +/- 4.89 degrees , P = 0.006), and %AVBH (77.16% vs\\n      90.83%, P = 0.01) between the two groups.Implant failure occurred after posterior\\n      fixation in five patients with disc injury who did not undergo interbody fusion\\n      during the initial surgery. Additionally, in the subgroup analysis, interbody\\n      fusion in the implant failure group were significantly different than in the no\\n      implant failure group (0% vs 75%, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: AO B2 fracture\\n      patients with disc injury have higher risk of complications, especially implant\\n      failure after posterior surgery. Interbody fusion should be considered in AO type\\n      B2 fracture patients with disc injury.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

STUDY DESIGN: We deployed a\\n      cross-sectional survey of 1701 parents of children with cancer about their ART\\n      use, demographics, and gestational and perinatal factors. Multivariable logistic \\n      regression modeled the association between ART use, birthweight and multiple\\n      gestation status with childhood cancer, by subtype. RESULTS: ART use was highest \\n      among children with osteosarcoma relative to children with other cancer types,\\n      and this association was statistically significant in multivariable models (OR = \\n      4.4; 95% CI = 1.7-11.3; p = 0.0020). ART use was also elevated among children\\n      with hepatoblastoma, but this relationship appeared to be due to the strong\\n      associations between ART use and lower birthweight in our sample. No specific ART\\n      modality appeared to drive these associations. In univariate models, multiple\\n      gestation was associated with a 2.7-fold increased odds of hepatoblastoma (OR =\\n      2.71; 95% CI = 1.14-6.42; p = 0.02) and a 1.6-fold increased odds of\\n      neuroblastoma (OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.03-2.54; p = 0.03), but these associations\\n      were not retained in multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between ART \\n      use and hepatoblastoma risk may be attributable to birthweight, a known\\n      hepatoblastoma risk factor. ART use may also be associated with osteosarcoma,\\n      independent of birthweight, an association not previously observed in studies\\n      limited to cancers diagnosed before adolescence. Evaluating long-term health\\n      outcomes in children conceived by ART, throughout adolescence and potentially\\n      into adulthood, appears warranted.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

Here we used bidirectional Mendelian\\n      randomization (MR) to measure the causal relationships between smoking, income,\\n      and education. DESIGN: Two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian\\n      randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to evaluate the total and direct\\n      effect of income and education on tobacco smoking. The effects of smoking on\\n      education and income were explored with reverse MR analysis. SETTING: European\\n      ancestry. PARTICIPANTS: The most recent large-scale genome-wide association study\\n      (GWAS) summary data on educational attainment, household income, and smoking\\n      (N=143,210 ~ 766,345). MEASUREMENTS: Genetic variants for exposures including\\n      income, education and smoking. FINDINGS: Both income and education had protective\\n      effects against smoking, especially for smoking initiation (education:\\n      beta=-0.447, 95% confidence interval [CI] =-0.508 to -0.387, p< 0.001; income:\\n      beta=-0.290, 95%CI=-0.43 to -0.149, p<0.001) and cessation (education:\\n      beta=-0.364, 95%CI=-0.429 to -0.298, p<0.001; income: beta=-0.323, 95%CI =-0.448 \\n      to -0.197, p<0.001). Here, higher scores in cessation indicated a lower\\n      likelihood of quitting according to the coding scheme. There was little evidence \\n      that income influenced smoking once education was controlled for, while education\\n      could significantly affect smoking behaviors independently of income\\n      (p=3.40x10(-10) ~0.0272). The reverse MR results suggested that smoking may\\n      result in a loss of years of schooling (beta=-0.190, 95%CI =-0.297 to -0.083,\\n      p<0.001) and reduced earnings (beta =-0.204, 95%CI =-0.347 to -0.060, p=0.006).\\n      CONCLUSIONS: Education appears to play an important role in the relationship\\n      between income and smoking. There is a bidirectional association of smoking with \\n      socioeconomic status.\\nCI  - This article is protected by copyright.

Patients and\\n      methods: We included 72 patients with varicose veins (VV) and 106 patients with\\n      deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The proximal leg veins were examined. A survey was\\n      sent to the members of the Union of Vascular Societies to assess, which methods\\n      are used in the clinical practice. Results: In the VV-group the correlation\\n      coefficient (VM vs CM) for the reflux time (RT) amounted to 0.44 (p<0.0001) for\\n      the common femoral vein (CFV) and 0.4 for the femoral vein (FV) (p=0.0003). The\\n      sensitivity of the two tests in the VV group amounted to 87.5% for both methods\\n      in the CFV (p=0.4). The sensitivity for the FV amounted to 87.5% for the VM and\\n      71.4% for the CM (p=0.4). In the DVT - group the correlation coefficient (VM vs\\n      CM) for RT amounted to 0.62 for the CFV (p<0.0001) and 0.77 for the FV\\n      (p<0.0001), as well as to 0.6 for the great saphenous vein (GSV) (p<0.0001). The \\n      sensitivity of the two tests amounted to 50.0% for the VM and 42.9% for the CM in\\n      the CFV (p=0.5). The sensitivity, if reflux was measured in the FV, amounted to\\n      42.9% for the VM and 50.0% for the CM (p=0.5). 87.3% of the doctors who answered \\n      the survey use a non-standardized reflux measurement method. Conclusions: Both\\n      methods of reflux measurement (VM, CM) are comparable.

SACVINFA study.\\nLID - 10.1111/jcpt.13742 [doi]\\nAB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are a \\n      group of chronic and highly disabling diseases. The objective is to evaluate the \\n      satisfaction with the health care received by patients with the most prevalent\\n      IMIDs in Spain: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis (Ps) psoriatic\\n      arthritis (PsA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthropathies (SpAs), and \\n      to determine the factors that influence patient satisfaction. METHODS: This was\\n      an observational, cross-sectional, multicentre study in a real-world evidence\\n      context conducted in the Pharmacy Service in four hospital centres of the\\n      Community of Madrid that belong to the National Health System. The study included\\n      adult patients diagnosed with an IMID who had attended the Pharmacy Service at\\n      least three times. The patients were grouped according to the main IMID. Health\\n      care satisfaction was evaluated using the chronic patient experience assessment\\n      (IEXPAC) questionnaire. The responses to IEXPAC are grouped into three factors:\\n      productive interactions, new relational model and patient self-management, with a\\n      total score from 0 (worst) to 10 (best experience). Health-related quality of\\n      life (HRQoL) was also evaluated using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, and\\n      pharmacological adherence was evaluated through the Morisky-Green test. RESULTS\\n      AND DISCUSSION: A total of 578 patients were analysed (IBD = 25.3%; Ps = 19.7%;\\n      SpAs = 18.7%; RA = 18.5%; PsA = 17.8%). The mean age (SD) was 49.8 (12.3) years\\n      and 50.7% were male. The average score (SD) for the total IEXPAC sample was 6.6\\n      (1.9). RA was the IMID with the lowest score, at 5.83 (2.0), significantly lower \\n      than the scores of Ps (SD) [7.01 (1.7); p = 0.003], IBD [6.83 (1, 9); p = 0.012] \\n      and SpAs [6.80 (1.6); p = 0.001]. Productive interactions (SD) [8.5 (1.8)] and\\n      patient self-management (SD) [7.3 (2.3)] were the factors with the highest\\n      scores, and the new relational model had the lowest score (SD) [3.2 (2.7)]. Male \\n      gender, a longer time interval between medication administrations and a higher\\n      HRQoL were correlated with better patient satisfaction. Current biological\\n      therapy (according to the Anatomical Chemical classification system) also had a\\n      significant influence; patients treated with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors\\n      and interleukin inhibitors showed greater satisfaction than those treated with\\n      selective immunosuppressants. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The IEXPAC results show\\n      high general satisfaction with care quality reported by patients with IMIDs\\n      treated in the Pharmacy Service. However, there are areas of improvement in care \\n      quality specially health professional-patient communication, such as increasing\\n      access to information, and promoting and facilitating relationships with patients\\n      in similar conditions.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\\nFAU - Ramirez, Esther\\nAU  - Ramirez E\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital Universitario La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.\\nFAU - Romero-Jimenez, Rosa\\nAU  - Romero-Jimenez R\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, \\n      Spain.\\nFAU - Hernandez, Belen\\nAU  - Hernandez B\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada, Madrid, Spain.\\nFAU - Fernandez-Pacheco, Maria\\nAU  - Fernandez-Pacheco M\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias, Madrid,\\n      Spain.\\nFAU - Calvo, Alberto\\nAU  - Calvo A\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital Universitario La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.\\nFAU - Chamorro, Esther\\nAU  - Chamorro E\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, \\n      Spain.\\nFAU - Herrero, Nuria\\nAU  - Herrero N\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada, Madrid, Spain.\\nFAU - Ubeda, Barbara\\nAU  - Ubeda B\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias, Madrid,\\n      Spain.\\nFAU - Morell, Alberto\\nAU  - Morell A\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital Universitario La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.\\nFAU - Ais-Larisgoi, Arantza\\nAU  - Ais-Larisgoi A\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, \\n      Spain.\\nFAU - Lobato-Matilla, Elena\\nAU  - Lobato-Matilla E\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, \\n      Spain.\\nFAU - Munoz, Alvaro\\nAU  - Munoz A\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0896-1423\\nAD  - Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research Iberia (PORIB), Madrid, Spain.\\nFAU - Casado, Araceli\\nAU  - Casado A\\nAD  - Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research Iberia (PORIB), Madrid, Spain.\\nFAU - Casado, Miguel Angel\\nAU  - Casado MA\\nAD  - Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research Iberia (PORIB), Madrid, Spain.\\nFAU - Escudero-Vilaplana, Vicente\\nAU  - Escudero-Vilaplana V\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4417-8321\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, \\n      Spain.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - J Clin Pharm Ther\\nJT  - Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics\\nJID - 8704308\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - care quality\\nOT  - immune-mediated inflammatory diseases\\nOT  - patient experience\\nOT  - patient satisfaction\\nOT  - pharmacy service\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 07:02\\nPHST- 2022/06/03 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/04/07 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/10 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 07:02 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1111/jcpt.13742 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Clin Pharm Ther. 2022 Aug 5. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.13742.\\n\\nPMID- 35929566\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1530-8561 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0009-9147 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Effect of Macrotroponin in a Cohort of Community Patients with Elevated Cardiac\\n      Troponin.\\nLID - hvac118 [pii]\\nLID - 10.1093/clinchem/hvac118 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND: Macrotroponin is an important cause of discrepancy between current\\n      high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays, however, its clinical\\n      significance is unclear. This study examined the effects of macrotroponin and\\n      repeat testing by different hs-cTnI assays in a cohort of community patients with\\n      elevated hs-cTnI. METHODS: The first residual serum specimen from each patient in\\n      the community admitted to hospital with elevated hs-cTnI (Siemens hs-cTnI\\n      Centaur) was retested after immunoglobulin depletion and by 5 other hs-cTn\\n      assays. Low recovery of cTnI (<40%) following immunoglobulin depletion was\\n      considered as macrotroponin. A retrospective chart review was performed for these\\n      participants. Investigator-adjudicated diagnosis served as the reference\\n      standard. RESULTS: In our cohort of community patients with elevated troponin (n \\n      = 188), participants with macrotroponin (n = 99) often had a multifactorial or\\n      indeterminate myocardial injury (56% vs 25%) and were less likely to have acute\\n      coronary syndrome (9% vs 28%). On repeat testing of cTn on other platforms,\\n      better diagnostic performance (c-statistics) for ischemic and non-ischemic\\n      cardiac causes was observed on the Beckman Access hs-cTnI (0.74; 95% confidence\\n      interval [CI] 0.67-0.81) or the Abbott hs-cTnI Architect (0.75; CI 0.68-0.82)\\n      compared to the Siemens hs-cTnI Vista (0.62; CI 0.54-0.70; P < 0.05). This could \\n      be attributed to differences in assay reactivity for macrotroponin.\\n      Interestingly, better diagnostic performance was observed in patients without\\n      macrotroponin. Although a small number of deaths occurred (n = 16), participants \\n      with macrotroponin had better overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: In the low-risk\\n      setting, the presence of macrotroponin was clinically associated with\\n      multifactorial or indeterminate causes of troponin elevation.\\nCI  - (c) American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2022.

We aimed to evaluate the association of\\n      six surrogate indexes of IR with incident stroke and to compare their predictive \\n      capacity. METHODS: We analyzed data from 14,595 eligible study participants from \\n      the Rural Chinese Cohort Study. Modified Poisson regression models were used to\\n      estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of incident \\n      stroke associated with the visceral adiposity index (VAI), the Chinese visceral\\n      adiposity index (CVAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), triglyceride-glucose\\n      (TyG), TyG-body mass index (TyG-BMI), and TyG-waist circumference (TyG-WC). The\\n      receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) was used to compare the ability of\\n      the abovementioned IR indexes to predict stroke. RESULTS: During a median\\n      follow-up of 6 years, 786 newly-diagnosed stroke cases were identified. The\\n      levels of six surrogate indexes of IR were all significantly higher in the stroke\\n      population than in the non-stroke population (p<0.001). Compared with quartile 1,\\n      the multivariable adjusted RRs (95% CIs) of incident stroke for quartile 4 were\\n      2.01 (1.47-2.76), 1.62 (1.28, 2.04), 1.64 (1.28-2.09), and 1.92 (1.50-2.45) for\\n      CVAI, VAI, LAP, and TyG, respectively. Significant dose-response associations\\n      were also found between surrogate IR indexes and risk of stroke. The area under\\n      the curves (AUCs) for CVAI (0.674) was significantly greater than for other\\n      indexes (TyG-WC:0.622, TyG:0.614, LAP:0.606, TyG-BMI:0.598, and VAI:0.577)\\n      (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Six surrogate indexes of IR were independently associated\\n      with incident stroke. The CVAI may be the most suitable index for stroke\\n      prediction.

Due to their\\n      similarity, the correct identification of these pathogens is difficult and\\n      time-consuming. Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated extensively as a tool\\n      for rapid microbiological differentiation. However, for pathogenic\\n      Enterobacteriaceae the application of Raman spectroscopy has been particularly\\n      challenging. In this study, two promising methods for Raman-based microbiological\\n      diagnostics were compared for differentiating Enterobacteriaceae. Spectra were\\n      collected from single-cells with Raman microspectroscopy and from colonies on\\n      agar with an NIR Raman fiber-probe. A comprehensive dataset of spectra from 8\\n      different, clinically relevant, genera was collected. Visually, the spectra\\n      obtained from both methods presented little difference between the genera. For\\n      classification, single cell analysis yielded limited results, while the\\n      fiber-probe spectra enabled perfect classification of all 16 isolates. Moreover, \\n      the model was validated on new replicates and 15/16 strains were correctly\\n      identified (94% overall accuracy). This is the first study to focus on the\\n      closely related Enterobacteriaceae, who have previously been avoided or\\n      differentiated poorly. It shows how, with the correct spectroscopic setup, even\\n      challenging questions in clinical microbiology can be resolved with Raman\\n      spectroscopy, highlighting the method\\'s potential for improving patient care.\\nFAU - Nakar, Amir\\nAU  - Nakar A\\nAUID- ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1342-7471\\nAD  - Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology Jena - Member of the research alliance\\n      \"Leibniz Health Technologies\", Jena, Germany.\\nAD  - Institute of Physical Chemistry and Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich Schiller \\n      University Jena, Germany. petra.roesch@uni-jena.de.\\nAD  - Research Campus Infectognostics, Jena, Germany.\\nFAU - Wagenhaus, Annette\\nAU  - Wagenhaus A\\nAD  - Institute of Physical Chemistry and Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich Schiller \\n      University Jena, Germany. petra.roesch@uni-jena.de.\\nFAU - Rosch, Petra\\nAU  - Rosch P\\nAUID- ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6179-3719\\nAD  - Institute of Physical Chemistry and Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich Schiller \\n      University Jena, Germany. petra.roesch@uni-jena.de.\\nAD  - Research Campus Infectognostics, Jena, Germany.\\nFAU - Popp, Jurgen\\nAU  - Popp J\\nAUID- ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4257-593X\\nAD  - Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology Jena - Member of the research alliance\\n      \"Leibniz Health Technologies\", Jena, Germany.\\nAD  - Institute of Physical Chemistry and Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich Schiller \\n      University Jena, Germany. petra.roesch@uni-jena.de.\\nAD  - Research Campus Infectognostics, Jena, Germany.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Analyst\\nJT  - The Analyst\\nJID - 0372652\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 06:13\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 06:13 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1039/d2an00822j [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Analyst. 2022 Aug 5. doi: 10.1039/d2an00822j.\\n\\nPMID- 35929510\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 0189-160X (Print)\\nIS  - 0189-160X (Linking)\\nVI  - 39\\nIP  - 7\\nDP  - 2022 Jul 31\\nTI  - Association between Abnormal Serum Lipid Levels in Early Pregnancy and\\n      Development of Preeclampsia.\\nPG  - 761-768\\nLID - West Afr J Med.

The\\n      study of association between abnormal lipid levels in early pregnancy and\\n      preeclampsia is thus necessary in a bid to reduce the progression and severity of\\n      complications of preeclampsia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between\\n      abnormal lipid levels in early pregnancy and the development of preeclampsia.\\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study involving 184 pregnant\\n      women with singleton pregnancy who met the inclusion criteria and recruited from \\n      the antenatal clinic at gestational age of < 20weeks. Their fasting blood samples\\n      were collected for the measurement serum lipid profile. They were monitored until\\n      delivery for the development of preeclampsia. The mean values of serum lipid\\n      profile were analyzed for association with pre-eclampsia using the statistical\\n      package for social sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 and P value of < 0.05 was\\n      considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Out of 184 participants, 3 had\\n      spontaneous miscarriage and were excluded while 5 were lost to follow up. This\\n      left a total of 176 participants who completed the study, 11 of which developed\\n      preeclampsia. There was a statistically significant increase in the levels of\\n      total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the preeclamptic\\n      group. The mean serum lipid levels were 4.8 mmol/L for total cholesterol, 1.87\\n      mmol/L for total triglycerides, 1.3 mmol/L for high-density lipoprotein and 2.67 \\n      mmol/L for low-density lipoprotein. Age and parity also showed a causal\\n      association with development of preeclampsia.

The DR-FLASH score (score based on diabetes\\n      mellitus, renal dysfunction, persistent form of atrial fibrillation, left\\n      atrialdiameter >45 mm, age >65 years, female sex, and hypertension) is reportedly\\n      useful for identifying patients with arrhythmogenic substrates. We hypothesized\\n      that, in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, the DR-FLASH score can be \\n      used to classify patients into those who require PVI-plus and those for whom a\\n      PVI-only strategy is sufficient. Methods and Results This study is a post hoc\\n      subanalysis of the a multicenter, randomized controlled, noninferiority trial\\n      investigating efficacy and safety of pulmonary vein isolation alone for\\n      recurrence prevention compared with extensive ablation in patients with\\n      persistent atrial fibrillation (EARNEST-PVI trial). This analysis focuses on the \\n      relationship between DR-FLASH score and the efficacy of different ablation\\n      strategies. We divided the population into 2 groups based on a DR-FLASH score of \\n      3 points. A total of 469 patients were analyzed. Among those with a DR-FLASH\\n      score >3 (N=279), the event rate of atrial arrhythmia recurrence was\\n      significantly lower in the PVI-plus arm than in the PVI-only arm (hazard ratio\\n      [HR], 0.45 [95% CI, 0.28-0.72]; P<0.001). In contrast, among patients with a\\n      DR-FLASH score </=3 (N=217), no differences were observed in the event rate of\\n      atrial arrhythmia recurrence between the PVI-only arm and the PVI-plus arm (HR,\\n      1.08 [95% CI, 0.61-1.89]; P=0.795). There was significant interaction between\\n      patients with a DR-FLASH score >3 and DR-FLASH score </=3 (P value for\\n      interaction=0.020). Conclusions The DR-FLASH score is a useful tool for deciding \\n      the catheter ablation strategy for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. \\n      Registration URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03514693.\\nFAU -

Methods and Results The CREDENCE\\n      trial compared canagliflozin or matching placebo in 4401 patients with type 2\\n      diabetes, albuminuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 to <90\\n      mL/min per 1.73 m(2), over a median of 2.6 years. The primary outcome was\\n      analyzed as a composite of any cardiovascular event including myocardial\\n      infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, hospitalization for\\n      unstable angina, and cardiovascular death. Negative binomial regression models\\n      were used to assess the effect of canagliflozin on the net burden of\\n      cardiovascular events. During the trial, 634 patients had 883 cardiovascular\\n      events, of whom 472 (74%) had just 1 cardiovascular event and 162 (26%) had\\n      multiple cardiovascular events. Canagliflozin reduced first cardiovascular events\\n      by 26% (hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.63-0.86]; P<0.001) and total cardiovascular\\n      events by 29% (incidence rate ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59-0.86]; P<0.001). The\\n      absolute risk difference per 1000 patients treated over 2.5 years was -44 (95%\\n      CI, -67 to -21) first cardiovascular events and -73 (95% CI, -114 to -33) total\\n      events. Conclusions Canagliflozin reduced cardiovascular events, with a larger\\n      absolute benefit for total cardiovascular than first cardiovascular events. These\\n      findings provide further support for the benefit of continuing canagliflozin\\n      therapy after an initial event to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events.\\n      Registration Information URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique Identifier: \\n      NCT02065791.\\nFAU -

Intrapatient\\n      fall of systolic BP from baseline was measured. Eighty-one patients (mean age,\\n      61+/-19 years; 46 women) were included. Overall, HeartGuide was able to yield BP \\n      values at the time of BP nadir in 58 (72%) patients (average HeartGuide SBP\\n      102+/-18 mm Hg, versus finger SBP 101+/-19 mm Hg). Compared with baseline, the\\n      maximum SBP decrease was on average -28.5+/-27.8 and -30.3+/-33.9 mm Hg\\n      respectively (Lin\\'s concordance correlation coefficient=0.78, r=0.79, P=0.001).\\n      In the subgroup of 38 patients with tilt table test induced (pre)syncope, the\\n      average HeartGuide SBP during symptoms was 97+/-16 mm Hg, and the finger SBP was \\n      94+/-18 mm Hg. Compared with baseline, the maximum SBP decrease was on average\\n      -35.2+/-29.3 and -43.3+/-31.8 mm Hg, respectively (Lin\\'s concordance correlation \\n      coefficient=0.83, r=0.87, P=0.001). Conclusions Our data indicate that the\\n      HeartGuide BP monitor can detect low BP during presyncope and that its measure of\\n      SBP change is consistent with that simultaneously obtained through continuous BP \\n      monitoring, despite some intrapatient variability. Thus, this device might be\\n      useful in determining the hypotensive nature of spontaneous (pre)syncopal\\n      symptoms, a possibility that should be verified by field studies.\\nFAU - Groppelli, Antonella\\nAU  - Groppelli A\\nAD  - IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Faint & Fall Programme, Cardiology Unit and\\n      Department of Cardiology San Luca Hospital Milan Italy.\\nFAU - Rafanelli, Martina\\nAU  - Rafanelli M\\nAD  - Syncope Unit, Division of Geriatric and Intensive Care Medicine University of\\n      Florence and Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi Florence Italy.\\nFAU - Testa, Giuseppe Dario\\nAU  - Testa GD\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-9157-3781\\nAD  - Syncope Unit, Division of Geriatric and Intensive Care Medicine University of\\n      Florence and Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi Florence Italy.\\nFAU - Agusto, Samuele\\nAU  - Agusto S\\nAD  - Syncope Unit, Division of Geriatric and Intensive Care Medicine University of\\n      Florence and Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi Florence Italy.\\nFAU - Rivasi, Giulia\\nAU  - Rivasi G\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-2736-2242\\nAD  - Syncope Unit, Division of Geriatric and Intensive Care Medicine University of\\n      Florence and Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi Florence Italy.\\nFAU - Ungar, Andrea\\nAU  - Ungar A\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-8965-4523\\nAD  - Syncope Unit, Division of Geriatric and Intensive Care Medicine University of\\n      Florence and Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi Florence Italy.\\nFAU - Carbone, Erika\\nAU  - Carbone E\\nAD  - IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Faint & Fall Programme, Cardiology Unit and\\n      Department of Cardiology San Luca Hospital Milan Italy.\\nFAU - Soranna, Davide\\nAU  - Soranna D\\nAD  - IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Faint & Fall Programme, Cardiology Unit and\\n      Department of Cardiology San Luca Hospital Milan Italy.\\nFAU - Zambon, Antonella\\nAU  - Zambon A\\nAD  - IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Faint & Fall Programme, Cardiology Unit and\\n      Department of Cardiology San Luca Hospital Milan Italy.\\nAD  - Department of Statistics University of Milano-Bicocca Milan Italy.\\nFAU - Brignole, Michele\\nAU  - Brignole M\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-1845-5607\\nAD  - IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Faint & Fall Programme, Cardiology Unit and\\n      Department of Cardiology San Luca Hospital Milan Italy.\\nFAU - Parati, Gianfranco\\nAU  - Parati G\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-9402-7439\\nAD  - IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Faint & Fall Programme, Cardiology Unit and\\n      Department of Cardiology San Luca Hospital Milan Italy.\\nAD  - Department of Medicine and Surgery University of Milano Bicocca Milan Italy.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - J Am Heart Assoc\\nJT  - Journal of the American Heart Association\\nJID - 101580524\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - blood pressure monitoring\\nOT  - finger blood pressure\\nOT  - syncope\\nOT  - wearable (watch-type) monitor\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 05:23\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 05:23 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1161/JAHA.122.026420 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Am Heart Assoc. 2022 Aug 5:e026420. doi: 10.1161/JAHA.122.026420.\\n\\nPMID- 35929467\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2047-9980 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2047-9980 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Short-Term Outcomes Following Left Atrial Appendage Closure in the Very Elderly: \\n      A Population-Based Analysis.\\nPG  - e024574\\nLID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024574 [doi]\\nAB  - Background Data on percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) outcomes in \\n      the very elderly with atrial fibrillation are limited. We aimed to investigate\\n      the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of patients 80 years or\\n      older following percutaneous LAAC in a large nationwide database. Methods and\\n      Results Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database, we identified patients who\\n      underwent percutaneous LAAC between January 2016 and December 2018. Patients were\\n      categorized based on age (>/=80 and <80 years old). The primary outcome was\\n      in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital end points including\\n      periprocedural complications, 30-day outcomes, and all-cause 30-day readmissions.\\n      A propensity score-matched model (1:1) was used to adjust for baseline\\n      characteristics among the study groups. A total of 13 208 patients were included \\n      in this study (43% women, median age in years [interquartile range] 79.5 [73-84])\\n      and matched one-to-one (6604 and 6604 patients were >/=80 and <80 years old,\\n      respectively). In-hospital mortality was not statistically different between the \\n      study groups and occurred in 21 patients >/=80 years old (0.32%) and in 14\\n      patients <80 years old (0.21%); P=0.236. Rates of in-hospital stroke/transient\\n      ischemic attack were higher in patients >/=80 years old compared with those <80\\n      years old (1.22% versus 0.77%; P=0.009). In-hospital bleeding requiring\\n      transfusion, vascular complications, systemic embolization, and pericardial\\n      effusion/tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis or surgical intervention occurred\\n      more frequently in patients >/=80 years old. Furthermore, the elderly group was\\n      more likely to be readmitted within 30 days compared with those <80 years old\\n      (9.91% versus 8.4%; P=0.004); however, rates of 30-day complications were not\\n      statistically different between the study groups. Conclusions In a large\\n      nationwide database, patients >/=80 years old undergoing percutaneous LAAC were\\n      found to have similar in-hospital mortality but an increased risk of\\n      periprocedural complications and 30-day readmission compared with younger\\n      patients. Our data suggest that LAAC should be considered on a case-by-case basis\\n      in the very elderly, taking into consideration the risks and benefits of this\\n      intervention. Further studies are needed to assess long-term LAAC outcomes in\\n      this high-risk population.\\nFAU - Farwati, Medhat\\nAU  - Farwati M\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-9052-9690\\nAD  - Department of Internal Medicine Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH.\\nFAU - Amin, Mustapha\\nAU  - Amin M\\nAD  - Department of Internal Medicine Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH.\\nFAU - Isogai, Toshiaki\\nAU  - Isogai T\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-2172-6447\\nAD  - Heart and Vascular Institute Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH.\\nFAU - Saad, Anas M\\nAU  - Saad AM\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-0101-0131\\nAD  - Heart and Vascular Institute Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH.\\nFAU - Abushouk, Abdelrahman I\\nAU  - Abushouk AI\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-1399-6487\\nAD  - Heart and Vascular Institute Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH.\\nFAU - Krishnaswamy, Amar\\nAU  - Krishnaswamy A\\nAD  - Heart and Vascular Institute Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH.\\nFAU - Wazni, Oussama\\nAU  - Wazni O\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7115-7716\\nAD  - Heart and Vascular Institute Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH.\\nFAU - Kapadia, Samir R\\nAU  - Kapadia SR\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0026-3391\\nAD  - Heart and Vascular Institute Cleveland Clinic Cleveland OH.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - J Am Heart Assoc\\nJT  - Journal of the American Heart Association\\nJID - 101580524\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - atrial fibrillation\\nOT  - elderly\\nOT  - left atrial appendage closure\\nOT  - outcomes\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 05:23\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 05:23 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024574 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Am Heart Assoc. 2022 Aug 5:e024574. doi: 10.1161/JAHA.121.024574.\\n\\nPMID- 35929464\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2047-9980 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2047-9980 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Trends, Predictors, and Outcomes of 30-Day Readmission With Heart Failure After\\n      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Insights From the US Nationwide\\n      Readmission Database.\\nPG  - e024890\\nLID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024890 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND Data on trends, predictors, and outcomes of heart failure (HF)\\n      readmissions after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remain limited. \\n      Moreover, the relationship between hospital TAVR discharge volume and HF\\n      readmission outcomes has not been established. METHODS AND RESULTS The Nationwide\\n      Readmission Database was used to identify 30-day readmissions for HF after TAVR\\n      from October 1, 2015, to November 30, 2018, using International Classification of\\n      Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes. A total of 167\\n      345 weighted discharges following TAVR were identified. The all-cause readmission\\n      rate within 30 days of discharge was 11.4% (19 016). Of all the causes of 30-day \\n      rehospitalizations, HF comprised 31.4% (5962) of all causes. The 30-day\\n      readmission rate for HF did not show a significant decline during the study\\n      period (Ptrend=0.06); however, all-cause readmission rates decreased\\n      significantly (Ptrend=0.03). HF readmissions were comparable between high- and\\n      low-volume TAVR centers. Charlson Comorbidity Index >8, length of stay >4 days\\n      during the index hospitalization, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial\\n      fibrillation, chronic HF, preexisting pacemaker, complete heart block during\\n      index hospitalization, paravalvular regurgitation, chronic kidney disease, and\\n      end-stage renal disease were independent predictors of 30-day HF readmission\\n      after TAVR. HF readmissions were associated with higher mortality rates when\\n      compared with non-HF readmissions (4.9% versus 3.3%; P<0.01). Each HF readmission\\n      within 30 days was associated with an average increased cost of $13 000 more than\\n      for each non-HF readmission. CONCLUSIONS During the study period from 2015 to\\n      2018, 30-day HF readmissions after TAVR remained steady despite all-cause\\n      readmissions decreasing significantly. All-cause readmission mortality and HF\\n      readmission mortality also showed a nonsignificant downtrend. HF readmissions\\n      were comparable across low-, medium-, and high-volume TAVR centers. HF\\n      readmission was associated with increased mortality and resource use attributed\\n      to the increased costs of care compared with non-HF readmission. Further studies \\n      are needed to identify strategies to decrease the burden of HF readmissions and\\n      related mortality after TAVR.\\nFAU - Zahid, Salman\\nAU  - Zahid S\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2754-9397\\nAD  - Department of Medicine Rochester General Hospital Rochester NY.\\nFAU - Din, Mian Tanveer Ud\\nAU  - Din MTU\\nAD  - Department of Internal Medicine Allegheny Health Network Pittsburgh PA.\\nFAU - Khan, Muhammad Zia\\nAU  - Khan MZ\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-8473-8069\\nAD  - Division of Cardiology West Virginia University Heart & Vascular Institute\\n      Morgantown WV.\\nFAU - Rai, Devesh\\nAU  - Rai D\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-1287-6440\\nAD  - Department of Medicine Rochester General Hospital Rochester NY.\\nFAU - Ullah, Waqas\\nAU  - Ullah W\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-4850-0309\\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine Jefferson University Hospitals Philadelphia\\n      PA.\\nFAU - Sanchez-Nadales, Alejandro\\nAU  - Sanchez-Nadales A\\nAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Medicine Cleveland Clinic Florida Weston FL.\\nFAU - Elkhapery, Ahmed\\nAU  - Elkhapery A\\nAD  - Department of Medicine Rochester General Hospital Rochester NY.\\nFAU - Khan, Muhammad Usman\\nAU  - Khan MU\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-4452-6317\\nAD  - Division of Cardiology West Virginia University Heart & Vascular Institute\\n      Morgantown WV.\\nFAU - Goldsweig, Andrew M\\nAU  - Goldsweig AM\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2952-7837\\nAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Medicine University of Nebraska Medical Center Omaha\\n      NE.\\nFAU - Singla, Atul\\nAU  - Singla A\\nAD  - Kaweah Health Medical Center Visalia CA.\\nFAU - Fonarrow, Greg\\nAU  - Fonarrow G\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3192-8093\\nAD  - Division of Cardiovascular Medicine University of California Los Angeles Los\\n      Angeles CA.\\nFAU - Balla, Sudarshan\\nAU  - Balla S\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-7872-3757\\nAD  - Division of Cardiology West Virginia University Heart & Vascular Institute\\n      Morgantown WV.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - J Am Heart Assoc\\nJT  - Journal of the American Heart Association\\nJID - 101580524\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - TAVI\\nOT  - TAVR\\nOT  - heart failure\\nOT  - transcatheter aortic valve implantation\\nOT  - transcatheter aortic valve replacement\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 05:23\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 05:23 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024890 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Am Heart Assoc. 2022 Aug 5:e024890. doi: 10.1161/JAHA.121.024890.\\n\\nPMID- 35929463\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2047-9980 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2047-9980 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Prevalence of Mitral Annulus Disjunction and Mitral Valve Prolapse in Patients\\n      With Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrillation.\\nPG  - e025364\\nLID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.025364 [doi]\\nAB  - Background Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) is diagnosed in patients\\n      with ventricular fibrillation of which the origin is not identified after\\n      extensive evaluations. Recent studies suggest an association between mitral\\n      annulus disjunction (MAD), mitral valve prolapse (MVP), and ventricular\\n      arrhythmias. The prevalence of MAD and MVP in patients with IVF in this regard is\\n      not well established. We aimed to explore the prevalence of MAD and MVP in a\\n      consecutive cohort of patients with IVF compared with matched controls. Methods\\n      and Results In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, cardiac magnetic\\n      resonance images from patients with IVF (ie, negative for ischemia,\\n      cardiomyopathy, and channelopathies) and age- and sex-matched control subjects\\n      were analyzed for the presence of MAD (>/=2 mm) and MVP (>2 mm). In total, 72\\n      patients (mean age 39+/-14 years, 42% women) and 72 control subjects (mean age\\n      41+/-11 years, 42% women) were included. MAD in the inferolateral wall was more\\n      prevalent in patients with IVF versus healthy controls (7 [11%] versus 1 [1%],\\n      P=0.024). MVP was only seen in patients with IVF and not in controls (5 [7%]\\n      versus 0 [0%], P=0.016). MAD was observed in both patients with (n=4) and without\\n      (n=3) MVP. Conclusions Inferolateral MAD and MVP were significantly more\\n      prevalent in patients with IVF compared with healthy controls. The authors\\n      advocate that evaluation of the mitral valve region deserves extra attention in\\n      the extensive screening of patients with unexplained cardiac arrest.

Lipoprotein(a)\\n      (Lp(a)) is an atherogenic lipoprotein that elevates HeFH-related atherosclerotic \\n      cardiovascular disease risks. Whether circulating Lp(a) level associates with\\n      polyvascular propagation of atherosclerosis in subjects with HeFH remains\\n      uncertain. Methods and Results The current study analyzed 370 subjects with\\n      clinically diagnosed HeFH who received evaluation of systemic arteries.\\n      Polyvascular disease (polyVD) was defined as more than 2 coexisting\\n      atherosclerosis conditions including coronary artery disease, carotid stenosis,\\n      or peripheral artery disease. Clinical characteristics and lipid features were\\n      analyzed in subjects with HeFH and polyVD; 5.7% of patients with HeFH (21/370)\\n      had polyVD. They were more likely to have a clustering of risk factors, tendon\\n      (P<0.001) and skin xanthomas (P=0.004), and corneal arcus (P=0.026). Furthermore,\\n      an elevated Lp(a) level (P=0.006) and a greater frequency of Lp(a) level >/=50\\n      mg/dL (P<0.001) were observed in subjects with HeFH and polyVD. On multivariable \\n      analysis adjusting risk factors and lipid-lowering agents, Lp(a) >/=50 mg/dL\\n      (odds ratio [OR], 5.66 [95% CI, 1.68-19.0], P=0.005), age, and family history of \\n      premature coronary artery disease independently predicted polyVD in subjects with\\n      HeFH. Of note, the prevalence of polyVD rose to 33.3% in patients with HeFH and\\n      age >58 years old, family history of premature coronary artery disease, and Lp(a)\\n      >/=50 mg/dL (OR, 10.3 [95% CI, 3.12-33.4], P<0.001). Conclusions An increased\\n      level of circulating Lp(a) levels predicted concomitance of polyVD in patients\\n      with HeFH. The current findings suggest subjects with HeFH and Lp(a) >/=50 mg/dL \\n      as a high-risk category who require meticulous screening of systemic vascular\\n      beds.\\nFAU - Funabashi, Sayaka\\nAU  - Funabashi S\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3673-4941\\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine National Cerebral & Cardiovascular Centre\\n      Suita Osaka.\\nFAU - Kataoka, Yu\\nAU  - Kataoka Y\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-6307-5593\\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine National Cerebral & Cardiovascular Centre\\n      Suita Osaka.\\nFAU - Hori, Mika\\nAU  - Hori M\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-5459-6984\\nAD  - Department of Molecular Innovation in Lipidology National Cerebral &\\n      Cardiovascular Center Research Institute Suita Osaka.\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology Research Institute of Environmental Medicine Nagoya\\n      University Nagoya Aichi.\\nFAU - Ogura, Masatsune\\nAU  - Ogura M\\nAD  - Department of Molecular Innovation in Lipidology National Cerebral &\\n      Cardiovascular Center Research Institute Suita Osaka.\\nFAU - Doi, Takahito\\nAU  - Doi T\\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine National Cerebral & Cardiovascular Centre\\n      Suita Osaka.\\nFAU - Noguchi, Teruo\\nAU  - Noguchi T\\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Medicine National Cerebral & Cardiovascular Centre\\n      Suita Osaka.\\nFAU - Harada-Shiba, Mariko\\nAU  - Harada-Shiba M\\nAD  - Department of Molecular Innovation in Lipidology National Cerebral &\\n      Cardiovascular Center Research Institute Suita Osaka.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - J Am Heart Assoc\\nJT  - Journal of the American Heart Association\\nJID - 101580524\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - atherosclerosis\\nOT  - familial hypercholesterolemia\\nOT  - lipoprotein(a)\\nOT  - polyvascular disease\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 05:23\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 05:23 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.025232 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Am Heart Assoc. 2022 Aug 5:e025232. doi: 10.1161/JAHA.121.025232.\\n\\nPMID- 35929457\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2047-9980 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2047-9980 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Functional Echocardiographic and Serum Biomarker Changes Following Surgical and\\n      Percutaneous Atrial Septal Defect Closure in Children.\\nPG  - e024072\\nLID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024072 [doi]\\nAB  - Background Ventricular performance is temporarily reduced following surgical\\n      atrial septal defect closure. Cardiopulmonary bypass and changes in loading\\n      conditions are considered important factors, but this phenomenon is incompletely \\n      understood. We aim to characterize biventricular performance following surgical\\n      and percutaneous atrial septal defect closure and to relate biomarkers to\\n      ventricular performance following intervention. Methods and Results In this\\n      multicenter prospective study, children scheduled for surgical or percutaneous\\n      atrial septal defect closure were included. Subjects were assessed\\n      preoperatively, in the second week postintervention (at 2-weeks follow-up), and\\n      1-year postintervention (1-year follow-up). At each time point, an\\n      echocardiographic study and a panel of biomarkers were obtained. Sixty-three\\n      patients (median age, 4.1 [interquartile range, 3.1-6.1] years) were included.\\n      Forty-three patients underwent surgery. At 2-weeks follow-up, right ventricular\\n      global longitudinal strain was decreased for the surgical, but not the\\n      percutaneous, group (-17.6+/-4.1 versus -27.1+/-3.4; P<0.001). A smaller decrease\\n      was noted for left ventricular global longitudinal strain at 2-weeks follow-up\\n      for the surgical group (surgical versus percutaneous, -18.6+/-3.2 versus\\n      -20.2+/-2.4; P=0.040). At 1-year follow-up, left ventricular performance returned\\n      to baseline, whereas right ventricular performance improved, but did not reach\\n      preintervention levels. Eight biomarkers relating to cardiovascular and\\n      immunological processes differed across study time points. Of these biomarkers,\\n      only NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) correlated with less\\n      favorable left ventricular global longitudinal strain at 2-weeks follow-up.\\n      Conclusions Right, and to a lesser degree left, ventricular performance was\\n      reduced early after surgical atrial septal defect closure. Right ventricular\\n      performance at 1-year follow-up remained below baseline levels. Several\\n      biomarkers showed a pattern over time similar to ventricular performance. These\\n      biomarkers may provide insight into the processes that affect ventricular\\n      function.

This study was designed to explore the association\\n      between IRS-1, CYP2C19*2 genotypes, platelet reactivity, and 1-year outcome in\\n      patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary\\n      intervention. Methods and Results Genotyping was performed using an improved\\n      multiplex ligation detection reaction technique. Platelet aggregation was\\n      assessed by light transmission aggregometry. Major adverse cardiovascular events \\n      were defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and\\n      ischemic stroke. A total of 2213 consecutive patients were screened and 1614 were\\n      recruited. At 1 month, patients with IRS-1 CG genotype had significantly lower\\n      levels of ADP-induced platelet aggregation compared with patients with CC\\n      homozygotes. Patients with IRS-1 CG or GG genotype had a 2.09-fold higher risk of\\n      major adverse cardiovascular events compared with those with CC homozygotes (95% \\n      CI, 1.04-4.19; P=0.0376). By comparison, patients with CYP2C19*2 GA or AA\\n      genotype had higher ADP-induced platelet aggregation compared with patients with \\n      GG homozygotes. Although there was no significant difference in risk of major\\n      adverse cardiovascular events between patients with GA/AA and GG genotypes,\\n      patients with GA genotype had a 2.19-fold higher risk than those with GG\\n      homozygotes (95% CI, 1.13-4.24; P=0.0200). No interaction between IRS-1 and\\n      CYP2C19*2 genotypes was observed. Conclusions In patients following percutaneous \\n      coronary intervention, IRS-1 GG/CG and CYP2C19*2 GA genotypes were associated\\n      with 2.09- and 2.19-fold increased cardiovascular risk, respectively, at 1-year\\n      follow-up.

Methods and Results We performed a\\n      2-sample inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization analysis, multiple\\n      sensitivity analyses to assess pleiotropy and multivariate Mendelian\\n      randomization analyses to assess mediating/confounding factors. European-ancestry\\n      genomic summary data (P<5x10(-8)) for type 2 diabetes, lipid-fractions, smoking, \\n      alcohol and coffee consumption, physical activity, sleep, and education level\\n      were selected.

This study aimed to establish\\n      techniques to culture dechorionated embryos in different incubation systems and\\n      also to determine anaesthetic concentration for fish recipients in the larval\\n      stage for subsequent primordial germ cell transplantation. Intact and\\n      dechorionated embryos were divided into three incubation systems: (1) a control\\n      group with manual replacement of the solution; (2) a closed environment with high\\n      oxygen with manual replacement of the solution; and (3) constant solution\\n      recirculation. This combination resulted in six treatments. For the evaluation of\\n      anaesthetics for larvae, the concentrations evaluated were 19.5 mM, 24.4 mM, 29.3\\n      mM, and 34.2 mM of 2-phenoxyethanol. Anaesthesia concentration and recovery at\\n      different stages were evaluated. For transplantation, primordial germ cells of\\n      Astyanax altiparanae were transplanted into anaesthetised larvae (1 dph) of\\n      Prochilodus lineatus. Better results were obtained in the recirculation system\\n      for dechorionated embryos of P. lineatus for hatching (54.18%) and normal\\n      morphology (50.06%). The 2-phenoxyethanol anaesthetic with a dose of 29.3 mM\\n      resulted in shorter induction times, in addition to the recovery time between 5\\n      and 10 min.

Maturation is determined by the intricate balance between\\n      outward remodeling and intimal hyperplasia, whereby endothelial cell dysfunction,\\n      platelet aggregation, and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation play a\\n      crucial role. von Willebrand Factor (vWF) is an endothelial cell-derived protein \\n      involved in platelet aggregation and VSMC proliferation. We investigated AVF\\n      vascular remodeling in vWF-deficient mice and vWF expression in failed and\\n      matured human AVFs. Methods and Results Jugular-carotid AVFs were created in\\n      wild-type and vWF(-/-) mice. AVF flow was determined longitudinally using\\n      ultrasonography, whereupon AVFs were harvested 14 days after surgery. VSMCs were \\n      isolated from vena cavae to study the effect of vWF on VSMC proliferation.\\n      Patient-matched samples of the basilic vein were obtained before brachio-basilic \\n      AVF construction and during superficialization or salvage procedure 6 weeks after\\n      AVF creation. vWF deficiency reduced VSMC proliferation and macrophage\\n      infiltration in the intimal hyperplasia. vWF(-/-) mice showed reduced outward\\n      remodeling (1.5-fold, P=0.002) and intimal hyperplasia (10.2-fold, P<0.0001). AVF\\n      flow in wild-type mice was incremental over 2 weeks, whereas flow in vWF(-/-)\\n      mice did not increase, resulting in a two-fold lower flow at 14 days compared\\n      with wild-type mice (P=0.016). Outward remodeling in matured patient AVFs\\n      coincided with increased local vWF expression in the media of the venous outflow \\n      tract. Absence of vWF in the intimal layer correlated with an increase in the\\n      intima-media ratio. Conclusions vWF enhances AVF maturation because its positive \\n      effect on outward remodeling outweighs its stimulating effect on intimal\\n      hyperplasia.\\nFAU - Laboyrie, Suzanne L\\nAU  - Laboyrie SL\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-8659-1838\\nAD  - Internal Medicine Leiden University Medical Centre Leiden The Netherlands.\\nFAU - de Vries, Margreet R\\nAU  - de Vries MR\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3648-9130\\nAD  - Surgery Leiden University Medical Centre Leiden The Netherlands.\\nFAU - de Jong, Alwin\\nAU  - de Jong A\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-4556-5393\\nAD  - Surgery Leiden University Medical Centre Leiden The Netherlands.\\nFAU - de Boer, Hetty C\\nAU  - de Boer HC\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-2677-4640\\nAD  - Internal Medicine Leiden University Medical Centre Leiden The Netherlands.\\nFAU - Lalai, Reshma A\\nAU  - Lalai RA\\nAD  - Internal Medicine Leiden University Medical Centre Leiden The Netherlands.\\nFAU - Martinez, Laisel\\nAU  - Martinez L\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3009-8761\\nAD  - Vascular Surgery University of Miami Miami FL.\\nFAU - Vazquez-Padron, Roberto I\\nAU  - Vazquez-Padron RI\\nAD  - Vascular Surgery University of Miami Miami FL.\\nFAU - Rotmans, Joris I\\nAU  - Rotmans JI\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-9682-6234\\nAD  - Internal Medicine Leiden University Medical Centre Leiden The Netherlands.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - J Am Heart Assoc\\nJT  - Journal of the American Heart Association\\nJID - 101580524\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - AVF maturation\\nOT  - VSMC\\nOT  - intimal hyperplasia\\nOT  - outward remodeling\\nOT  - von Willebrand Factor\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 05:22\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 05:22 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024581 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Am Heart Assoc. 2022 Aug 5:e024581. doi: 10.1161/JAHA.121.024581.\\n\\nPMID- 35929446\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2047-9980 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2047-9980 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Impact of Device Miniaturization on Insertable Cardiac Monitor Use in the\\n      Pediatric Population: An Analysis of the MarketScan Commercial and Medicaid\\n      Databases.\\nPG  - e024112\\nLID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024112 [doi]\\nAB  - Background Insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) are effective in the detection of\\n      paroxysmal arrhythmias. In 2014, the first miniaturized ICM was introduced with a\\n      less invasive implant technique. The impact of this technology on ICM use in\\n      pediatric patients has not been evaluated. We hypothesized an increase in annual \\n      pediatric ICM implants starting in 2014 attributable to device miniaturization.\\n      Methods and Results A retrospective observational study was conducted using\\n      administrative claims from MarketScan Medicaid and commercial insurance claims\\n      databases. Use of ICM between January 2013 and December 2018 was measured\\n      (normalized to the total enrolled population </=18 years) and compared with\\n      balancing measures (Holter ambulatory monitors, cardiac event monitors,\\n      encounters with syncope diagnosis, implantation of implantable\\n      cardioverter-defibrillator/pacemaker). Secondary analyses included evaluations of\\n      subsequent interventions and complications. The study cohort included 33 532 185 \\n      individual subjects, of which 769 (0.002%) underwent ICM implantation. Subjects\\n      who underwent ICM implantation were 52% male sex, with a median age of 16 years\\n      (interquartile range, 10-17 years). A history of syncope was present in 71%,\\n      palpitations in 43%, and congenital heart disease in 28%. Following release of\\n      the miniaturized ICM, use of ICMs increased from 5 procedures per million\\n      enrollees in 2013 to 11 per million between 2015 and 2018 (P<0.001), while\\n      balancing measures remained static. Of 394 subjects with >/=1 year of follow-up\\n      after implantation, interventions included catheter ablation in 24 (6%),\\n      pacemaker implantation in 15 (4%), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator\\n      implantation in 7 (2%).

Emerging evidence suggests a role for inflammatory\\n      processes through the actions of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling\\n      pathway. This study evaluated for associations between a GISC and levels of DNA\\n      methylation for genes within this pathway. METHODS: Prior to their second or\\n      third cycle of chemotherapy, 1071 outpatients reported symptom occurrence using\\n      the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. A GISC was identified using exploratory\\n      factor analysis. Differential methylation analyses were performed in two\\n      independent samples using EPIC (n = 925) and 450K (n = 146) microarrays. Trans\\n      expression-associated CpG (eCpG) loci for 56 NF-kappaB signaling pathway genes\\n      were evaluated. Loci significance were assessed using an exploratory false\\n      discovery rate (FDR) of 25% for the EPIC sample. For the validation assessment\\n      using the 450K sample, significance was assessed at an unadjusted p-value of\\n      0.05. RESULTS: For the EPIC sample, the GISC was associated with increased\\n      expression of lymphotoxin beta (LTB) at one differentially methylated trans eCpG \\n      locus (cg03171795; FDR = 0.168). This association was not validated in the 450K\\n      sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to identify an association between a\\n      GISC and epigenetic regulation of a gene that is involved in the initiation of\\n      gastrointestinal immune responses. Findings suggest that increased LTB expression\\n      by hypermethylation of a trans eCpG locus is involved in the occurrence of this\\n      cluster in patients receiving chemotherapy. LTB may be a potential therapeutic\\n      target for this common cluster.\\nFAU - Harris, Carolyn S\\nAU  - Harris CS\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7080-4990\\nAD  - School of Nursing, 16085University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.\\nFAU - Miaskowski, Christine A\\nAU  - Miaskowski CA\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5170-2027\\nAD  - School of Nursing, 16085University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.\\nAD  - School of Medicine, 12224University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.\\nFAU - Conley, Yvette P\\nAU  - Conley YP\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1784-6067\\nAD  - School of Nursing, 6614University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.\\nFAU - Hammer, Marilyn J\\nAU  - Hammer MJ\\nAD  - The Phyllis F.

Hence, this study proposed to\\n      qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the quality consistency of Catalpa\\n      fruit from the perspectives of chromatography and spectroscopy. First, the fusion\\n      fingerprints of 15 batches of Catalpa fruit pericarp and 15 batches of Catalpa\\n      fruit seed were established by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and \\n      ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy in equal weights, respectively, to avoid the\\n      unilaterality of a single analytical technique. The different medicinal parts of \\n      Catalpa fruit were graded and evaluated based on a systematically quantified\\n      fingerprint method, and the quality of the pericarp and seed was further\\n      investigated. The results revealed that the quality of most pericarp and seed\\n      samples was within the acceptable level range (grade </= 5), and that seed\\n      quality was clearly superior to pericarp quality. Furthermore, according to the\\n      research findings, the content of p-hydroxybenzoic acid in Catalpa fruit pericarp\\n      was generally higher than that in Catalpa fruit seed, while the content of\\n      catalposide was generally lower than that in Catalpa fruit seed. Additionally,\\n      the fingerprint-efficacy relationship with HPLC was discussed by binary\\n      correlation analysis, which indicated that catalposide had the strongest\\n      antioxidant activity. This study demonstrated that the analytical techniques\\n      based on chromatographic fingerprinting, spectral fingerprinting and antioxidant \\n      activity provided new theoretical foundation as well as technical guidance for\\n      Catalpa fruit quality control and rational utilization.\\nFAU - Xiao, Wanzhen\\nAU  - Xiao W\\nAD  - School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning,\\n      110016, China. guoping20023@163.com.\\nFAU - Gong, Dandan\\nAU  - Gong D\\nAUID- ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7338-2092\\nAD  - School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning,\\n      110016, China. guoping20023@163.com.\\nFAU - Li, Xiang\\nAU  - Li X\\nAD  - School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning,\\n      110016, China. guoping20023@163.com.\\nFAU - Guo, Ping\\nAU  - Guo P\\nAD  - School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning,\\n      110016, China. guoping20023@163.com.\\nFAU - Sun, Guoxiang\\nAU  - Sun G\\nAUID- ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8839-1733\\nAD  - School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning,\\n      110016, China. guoping20023@163.com.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Anal Methods\\nJT  - Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications\\nJID - 101519733\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 05:13\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 05:13 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1039/d2ay00919f [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Anal Methods. 2022 Aug 5. doi: 10.1039/d2ay00919f.\\n\\nPMID- 35929422\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2192-5682 (Print)\\nIS  - 2192-5682 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Where should Scoliometer and EOS Imaging be Applied when Evaluating Spinal\\n      Rotation in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis -A Preliminary Study with Reference\\n      to CT Images.\\nPG  - 21925682221116824\\nLID - 10.1177/21925682221116824 [doi]\\nAB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate spinal \\n      rotation measurement by scoliometer or EOS Imagings with reference to that by CT \\n      images, and to clarify their applicability in clinical practice. METHODS:\\n      Patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who were indicated for\\n      surgery were enrolled and the informed consents were obtained. The angle of trunk\\n      rotation (ATR) was measured by the scoliometer. Apical vertebral rotation (AVR)\\n      was measured with EOS Imaging and CT images. Paired T tests were used to compare \\n      the measurements between ATR or AVR-EOS and AVR-CT. Pearson correlation analysis \\n      was performed to explore the relationship between ATR or AVR-EOS and AVR-CT. Then\\n      subgroup analysis was performed. RESULTS: Forty-seven consecutive AIS patients\\n      with 62 curves were identified. In the whole group, the ATR, as well as AVR-EOS, \\n      was significantly smaller than the AVR-CT. Both ATR and AVR-EOS correlated with\\n      AVR-CT, although AVR-EOS correlated better. In thoracic group, there was no\\n      significant difference between ATR and AVR-CT (P = .236).

OBJECTIVE: The ROTAIO(R) cervical\\n      disc prosthesis is a novel unconstrained implant with a variable center of\\n      rotation aiming at physiological motion. The objective of this multicenter\\n      prospective trial was to evaluate clinical outcome and complications within 2\\n      years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 120 patients (72 females and 48 males with median\\n      age of 43.0 years [23-60 yrs] underwent ACDA (ROTAIO(R), SIGNUS Medical, Alzenau,\\n      Germany) and were prospectively followed for 24 months. Preoperative complaints\\n      were mainly associated with radiculopathy (n = 104) or myelopathy (n=16). There\\n      were 108 monosegmental and 12 bisegmental procedures including 6 hybrid\\n      constructs. Clinical outcome was evaluated at 3, 12 and 24 months in 100%, 96%\\n      and 77% of the cohort by VAS, NDI, WL-26, Patient`s Satisfaction Index (PSI),\\n      SF-36, Nurick Score, mJOA, Composite Success Rate, complications, patient`s\\n      overall satisfaction and analgesics use. RESULTS: Highly significant clinical\\n      improvements were observed according to NDI and VAS (P < .0001 (arm); P < .001\\n      (neck); P = .002 (head)) at all time points. Analgetic use could be reduced in\\n      87.1 to 95.2%. Doctor`s visits have been reduced in 93.8% after 24 months.\\n      Patient`s overall satisfaction was high with 78.4 to 83.5% of patients. The\\n      composite success rate was 77.5% after 12 months and 76.9% after 24 months. There\\n      were no major complications in this series. Slight subsidence of the prosthesis\\n      was observed in 2 patients and 3 patients demonstrated fusion after 24 months. 2 \\n      patients developed symptomatic foraminal stenosis, so that implant removal and\\n      fusion was performed resulting in a revision rate of 1.7% in 2 years. CONCLUSION:\\n      The ROTAIO(R) cervical disc prosthesis is a safe and efficient treatment option\\n      for symptomatic degenerative disc disease demonstrating highly significant\\n      clinical improvement and high patient`s overall satisfaction with very low\\n      revision rates at 2 years.\\nFAU - Fleck, Steffen\\nAU  - Fleck S\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2465-2893\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, 60634University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald,\\n      Germany.\\nFAU - Lang, Anna\\nAU  - Lang A\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.\\nFAU - Lehmberg, Jens\\nAU  - Lehmberg J\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, Klinikum Bogenhausen, Munich, Germany.\\nFAU - Landscheidt, Julia Fee\\nAU  - Landscheidt JF\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, Klinikum Bogenhausen, Munich, Germany.\\nFAU - Gerlach, Ruediger\\nAU  - Gerlach R\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, University Medicine Erfurt, Erfurt, Germany.\\nFAU - Rathert, Julian\\nAU  - Rathert J\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, University Medicine Erfurt, Erfurt, Germany.\\nFAU - Ulrich, Christian\\nAU  - Ulrich C\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, Lindenhofspital Bern, Switzerland.\\nFAU - Schar, Ralph T\\nAU  - Schar RT\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8998-9668\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of \\n      Bern, Switzerland.\\nFAU - Hartmann, Sebastian\\nAU  - Hartmann S\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.\\nFAU - Mueller, Jan-Uwe\\nAU  - Mueller JU\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, 60634University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald,\\n      Germany.\\nFAU - Thome, Claudius\\nAU  - Thome C\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - Global Spine J\\nJT  - Global spine journal\\nJID - 101596156\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - adjacent segment disease\\nOT  - cervical arthroplasty\\nOT  - cervical disc prosthesis\\nOT  - complications\\nOT  - outcome\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 04:43\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 04:43 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1177/21925682221109563 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Global Spine J. 2022 Aug 5:21925682221109563. doi: 10.1177/21925682221109563.\\n\\nPMID- 35929407\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1532-849X (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1059-941X (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Comparison of surface roughness and color stability of different denture\\n      characterizing composite resins: the effect of different surface treatments.\\nLID - 10.1111/jopr.13577 [doi]\\nAB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of surface treatment and type\\n      of composite resin material on the color stability and surface roughness of\\n      different denture characterizing composites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two\\n      nanohybrids [Gradia Plus Gum, (GP) and SR Nexco Paste Gingiva, (SR)] and one\\n      microhybrid gingiva-colored composite resin (Amaris Gingiva, (AG)] were\\n      investigated. A total of 120 disk-shaped samples were prepared, 40 of each\\n      material. Samples were divided into two groups (n = 20) for each material\\n      according to the surface treatment applied: conventional polishing (control) and \\n      coated with a sealant in addition to the surface polishing. All groups were\\n      thermocycled. The surface roughness (Ra) was measured using a profilometer after \\n      thermal cycling. The samples were then divided into 2 subgroups (n = 10) and\\n      stored for 7 days in distilled water or coffee solution. Color differences\\n      (DeltaE00 ) were calculated with a spectrophotometer. Results were evaluated with\\n      Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U statistical analysis. RESULTS: The type of\\n      denture characterizing composite material and surface treatment method revealed\\n      statistically significant differences for the DeltaE00 (after immersion both in\\n      coffee and distilled water) and the Ra values of denture characterizing composite\\n      (p < 0.001 for both). All sealed groups showed significantly higher Ra than the\\n      all polished groups. Both in the polished groups and the sealant applied groups, \\n      the GP had the highest mean Ra values (0.29 +/-0.05 mum and 0.47 +/-0.09 mum,\\n      respectively). It was followed by SR (0.23 +/-0.06 mum and 0.41 +/-0.10 mum,\\n      respectively), and AG groups (0.20 +/-0.06 mum and 0.39 +/-0.09 mum,\\n      respectively). According to the mean DeltaE00 results, all composite groups\\n      showed significantly higher DeltaE00 values immersed in coffee solutions compared\\n      to distilled water. In coffee solutions, the highest DeltaE00 was observed in the\\n      polished GP (1.90 +/-0.40), and the lowest DeltaE00 was observed in the polished \\n      SR (0.97 +/-0.36). The sealed groups showed higher DeltaE00 than the polished\\n      groups, except for GP. CONCLUSIONS: The surface roughness value of sealant\\n      applied groups were significantly higher than those of their polished groups. The\\n      surface sealant application significantly increased the staining of all composite\\n      groups compared to conventional polishing, except for GP.

To investigate FLASH RT planning using single-energy Bragg peak\\n      beams with a similar beam arrangement as clinical intensity-modulated proton\\n      therapy (IMPT) in liver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and to\\n      characterize the plan quality, dose sparing of organs-at-risk (OARs), and FLASH\\n      dose rate percentage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An in-house platform was developed\\n      to enable inverse IMPT-FLASH planning using single-energy Bragg peaks. A\\n      universal range shifter and range compensators were utilized to effectively align\\n      the Bragg peak to the distal edge of the target. Two different minimum MU\\n      settings of 400 and 800 MU/spot (Bragg-400MU and Bragg-800MU) plans were\\n      investigated on 10 consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma patients previously\\n      treated by IMPT-SBRT to evaluate the FLASH dose and dose rate coverage for OARs. \\n      The IMPT-FLASH using single-energy Bragg peaks delivered 50 Gy in 5 fractions\\n      with similar or identical beam arrangement to the clinical IMPT-SBRT plans. NRG\\n      GI003 dose constraint metrics were used. Three dose rate calculation methods,\\n      including average dose rate (ADR), dose threshold dose rate (DTDR), and\\n      dose-averaged dose rate (DADR), were all studied. RESULTS: The novel spot map\\n      optimization can fulfill the inverse planning using single-energy Bragg peaks.\\n      All the Bragg peak FLASH plans achieved similar results for the liver-GTV Dmean\\n      and heart D0.5cc , compared to SBRT-IMPT. The Bragg-800MU plans resulted in 18.3%\\n      higher CTV D2cc compared with SBRT (p < 0.05), and no significant difference was \\n      found between Bragg-400MU and SBRT plans. For the CTV Dmax , SBRT plans resulted \\n      in 10.3% (p<0.01) less than Bragg-400MU plans and 16.6% (p<0.01) less than\\n      Bragg-800MU plans. The Bragg-800MU plans generally achieved higher ADR, DADR, and\\n      DTDR dose rates than Bragg-400MU plans, and DADR mostly led to the highest\\n      V40Gy/s compared to other dose rate calculation methods, whereas ADR led to the\\n      lowest. The lower dose rate portions in certain OARs are related to the lower\\n      dose deposited due to the farther distances from targets, especially in the\\n      penumbra of the beams. CONCLUSION: Single-energy Bragg peak IMPT-FLASH plans\\n      eliminate the exit dose in normal tissues, maintaining comparable dose metrics to\\n      the conventional IMPT-SBRT plans while achieving a sufficient FLASH dose rate for\\n      liver cancers. This study demonstrates the feasibility of and sufficiently high\\n      dose rate when applying Bragg peak FLASH treatment for liver cancer\\n      hypofractionated FLASH therapy. The advancement of this novel method has the\\n      potential to optimize treatment for liver cancer patients. This article is\\n      protected by copyright.

Therefore, we\\n      evaluated the clinical and echocardiographic parameters associated with all-cause\\n      mortality in patients with severe functional TR who underwent TV surgery. METHODS\\n      AND RESULTS: A total of 286 patients with severe functional TR who underwent TV\\n      replacement or repair was analysed between January 2006 and December 2017. We\\n      assessed changes in conventional echocardiographic parameters and strain, such as\\n      peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS). During a median follow-up period of 5.3\\n      years, 71 (24.8%) patients died due to any cause. When comparing groups with and \\n      without all-cause deaths, there were no significant differences in terms of sex, \\n      co-morbidities, medication use, and surgery type. However, patients who died were\\n      older and more likely to have refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). With\\n      multivariate Cox modelling, age >65 years (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.81, 95% \\n      confidence interval [CI], 1.59-4.96; P < 0.001), refractory AF (adjusted HR,\\n      2.84, 95% CI, 1.36-5.94; P = 0.006), lower albumin level (adjusted HR, 0.50, 95% \\n      CI, 0.31-0.82), and reduced PALS (adjusted HR, 1.87, 95% CI, 1.06-3.33; P =\\n      0.032) were significant determinants of all-cause mortality. PALS decline was\\n      associated with refractory AF (adjusted HR, 5.74, 95% CI, 2.81-11.7; P < 0.001)\\n      and the absence of a Maze procedure (adjusted HR, 2.95, 95% CI, 1.51-5.78; P =\\n      0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in PALS was significantly associated with\\n      all-cause mortality in our cohort of patients with severe functional TR who\\n      underwent TV surgery. This phenomenon is related to refractory AF and more\\n      aggressive intervention for AF is necessary concomitant with TV surgery.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

The lack of evidence in this population may limit our\\n      ability to provide evidence-based treatments. This can partly be explained by\\n      difficulties in obtaining a satisfactory adherence to research in this\\n      population, especially when the practice of a physical activity is needed. In\\n      this study data from the LEDEN trial (Effects of a Long-term Exercise Program on \\n      Functional Ability in People with Dementia Living in Nursing Homes: A Cluster\\n      Randomized Controlled Trial) was used to determine the predictors of adherence to\\n      the study protocol. Methods: Retrospective cohort study based on the data from\\n      the cluster randomized, controlled LEDEN trial. The LEDEN trial aimed to compare \\n      the effects of an exercise intervention with a nonphysical intervention on the\\n      ability to perform activities of daily living. Predictors of adherence (being\\n      present at >/= 75% of sessions of the LEDEN trial) were identified by\\n      multivariable logistic regression. Results: By univariate analysis, the EVIBE\\n      scale (EValuation Immediate du Bien-Etre - evaluation of instantaneous\\n      well-being) measured at baseline was associated with study adherence, whereby\\n      higher scores were associated with higher adherence: 16.7% (1/6), 44.4% (4/9),\\n      56.5% (13/23), 48.1% (13/27) and 75.0% (15/20) respectively for EVIBE scores from\\n      1 to 5 (P = 0.02 for trend). By multi-variable analysis, an EVIBE scale score >/=\\n      4 did not predict clinical trial adherence (odds ratio [OR] 1.554, 95% confidence\\n      interval [CI] 0.619-3.942). Adherence was found to be lower among persons aged\\n      >/= 95 years (OR: 0.121, 95%CI: 0.006-0.982). Conclusion: Older age (>/= 95\\n      years) was associated with lower adherence to the study protocol. Further studies\\n      are needed to better understand and anticipate obstacles to adherence in\\n      research, while respecting consent procedures and patient autonomy.\\nFAU - Chrusciel, Jan\\nAU  - Chrusciel J\\nAD  - Pole Sante publique et performance, Centre hospitalier de Troyes, France\\nFAU - Letty, Aude\\nAU  - Letty A\\nAD  - Fondation Korian pour le Bien-vieillir, Paris, France\\nFAU - Armaingaud, Didier\\nAU  - Armaingaud D\\nAD  - Fondation Korian pour le Bien-vieillir, Paris, France\\nFAU - Barreto, Philippe\\nAU  - Barreto P\\nAD  - Gerontopole de Toulouse, Institut du Vieillissement, Toulouse, France\\nFAU - Berrut, Gilles\\nAU  - Berrut G\\nAD  - Fondation Korian pour le Bien-vieillir, Paris, France\\nAD  - Gerontopole Pays-de-la-Loire, Nantes, France\\nFAU - Rolland, Yves\\nAU  - Rolland Y\\nAD  - Gerontopole de Toulouse, Institut du Vieillissement, Toulouse, France\\nFAU - Sanchez, Stephane\\nAU  - Sanchez S\\nAD  - Pole Sante publique et performance, Centre hospitalier de Troyes, France\\nAD  - Fondation Korian pour le Bien-vieillir, Paris, France\\nLA  - fre\\nPT  - English Abstract\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nTT  - Facteurs associes a l\\'observance d\\'une intervention non medicamenteuse au cours\\n      d\\'une recherche menee en Etablissement d\\'hebergement pour personnes agees\\n      dependantes (Ehpad) : une analyse secondaire de l\\'etude LEDEN\\nPL  - France\\nTA  - Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil\\nJT  - Geriatrie et psychologie neuropsychiatrie du vieillissement\\nJID - 101553404\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - *homes for the aged\\nOT  - *clinical trial\\nOT  - *patient compliance\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 04:31\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 04:31 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1684/pnv.2022.1037 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil. 2022 Jun 1;20(2):199-207. doi:\\n      10.1684/pnv.2022.1037.\\n\\nPMID- 35929385\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2115-7863 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2115-7863 (Linking)\\nVI  - 20\\nIP  - 2\\nDP  - 2022 Jun 1\\nTI  - Interest of individual breast cancer screening by mammography in women aged over \\n      75 years\\nPG  - 182-189\\nLID - 10.1684/pnv.2022.1035 [doi]\\nAB  - Organized breast cancer screening in France is recommended for women up to 74\\n      years of age, while the frequency and severity of this cancer increases after 75 \\n      years. The aim of this work is to assess the potential benefits of extending\\n      organized screening. Methodology: Retrospective study of a continuous monocentric\\n      series of women over 75 having undergone surgery for breast cancer. The following\\n      variables were studied: addressing after screening or not, age at diagnosis, UICC\\n      stage and therapeutic measures (surgery by lumpectomy or mastectomy, lymph node\\n      dissection, adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormone\\n      therapy). Results: 185 women aged 82.8 +/- 5.2 years [extreme ages 75 to 95] were\\n      included in the study. 136 (73.5%) breast cancers were discovered after palpation\\n      and 49 (26.5%) after screening mammography. The distribution by stage was: I -\\n      38.8%, II - 39.5%, III - 15.1% and stage IV - 7%. 164 (87.7%), patients received \\n      surgical treatment: 115 lumpectomies (61.2%) and 49 mastectomies (26.5%). 51\\n      (27.6%) patients underwent lymph node dissection. The distribution of adjuvant\\n      treatments was: chemotherapy 21.1%, radiotherapy 68.6%, or hormone therapy\\n      (79.5%), sometimes combined. Women not screened are older than women screened (84\\n      +/- 5.3 versus 79.5 +/- 3.6 years; p < 0.0001). Cancers are diagnosed at a more\\n      advanced stage in non-screened patients compared to screened patients (p <\\n      0.0001). While there is a higher proportion of stage I among screened patients\\n      (75.5%), stage II is the most frequent in women not screened (47%). Stage I and\\n      II are the majority in the latter (72%). In multivariate analysis with adjustment\\n      for age, screening made it possible to make a diagnosis at a less advanced stage \\n      (stage I-II vs II-IV: OR = 5.593; 95% CI [1.575-19.866]; p = 0.0078) and to have \\n      conservative surgery more often (lumpectomy vs mastectomy: OR = 2.645; 95% CI\\n      [1.079-6.493]; p = 0.0333) without more recourse to surgery (OR = 1.856 95% CI\\n      [0.207-16.612]; p = 0.58). After adjusting for age and stage, screening was no\\n      longer a determining factor in the choice of type of surgery (OR = 1.934; 95% CI \\n      [0.753-4.975]; p = 0.170). Conclusion: At the age when organized breast cancer\\n      screening in France stopped, there was a decrease in survival, a diagnosis at a\\n      higher stage and an increase in co-morbidities. Our study shows a change in\\n      management with heavier treatment, more complications and a greater loss of\\n      autonomy without screening. This pleads for a continuation beyond 75 years of the\\n      practice of mammography screening for breast cancer in elderly women.\\nFAU - Pelofi, Guillaume\\nAU  - Pelofi G\\nAD  - Maison de sante, Montchanin, France\\nFAU - Martin, Xavier\\nAU  - Martin X\\nAD  - Hopital Prive Sainte-Marie, Chalon-sur-Saone, France\\nAD  - Hotel-Dieu, Le Creusot, France\\nFAU - Barben, Jeremy\\nAU  - Barben J\\nAD  - Centre geriatrique de Champmaillot, CHU de Dijon, France\\nFAU - Jouanny, Pierre\\nAU  - Jouanny P\\nAD  - Centre geriatrique de Champmaillot, CHU de Dijon, France\\nLA  - fre\\nPT  - English Abstract\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nTT  - Interet du depistage individuel du cancer du sein par mammographie chez la femme \\n      agee de plus de 75 ans\\nPL  - France\\nTA  - Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil\\nJT  - Geriatrie et psychologie neuropsychiatrie du vieillissement\\nJID - 101553404\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - *breast cancer\\nOT  - *screening\\nOT  - *elderly patient\\nOT  - *mammography\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 04:31\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 04:31 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1684/pnv.2022.1035 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil. 2022 Jun 1;20(2):182-189. doi:\\n      10.1684/pnv.2022.1035.\\n\\nPMID- 35929384\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2115-7863 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2115-7863 (Linking)\\nVI  - 20\\nIP  - 2\\nDP  - 2022 Jun 1\\nTI  - The immediate impact of Covid-19 infection and the resulting lockdown on nursing \\n      home residents\\nPG  - 173-181\\nLID - 10.1684/pnv.2022.1034 [doi]\\nAB  - Introduction: Following the Covid-19 epidemic affecting 76 of the 97 residents\\n      (78.3 %) in a French nursing home, we assessed the impact of this cluster period \\n      on the physical and psycho-cognitive health of the residents, expecting in\\n      particular to observe effects that were dependent on their state of\\n      cognitive-behavioural dependence. Methods: We retained twenty-two variables, 5\\n      relating to demographic data, 6 to the specific care linked to Covid-19\\n      infection, 6 to somatic pathologies and psycho-behavioural disturbances before\\n      the epidemic and 5 to the period following it. Results: Eleven residents among\\n      those diagnosed positive died. Nine were transferred to a Covid unit, and 35 were\\n      asymptomatic. The main consequences of the period of infections were in\\n      particular behavioural, nutritional, and motor. A history of disruptive\\n      behaviours before the appearance of the cluster increased the risk of an\\n      aggravation of these behaviours by four (RR = 3.9, IC95 % = 1.38-11.02, p =\\n      0.0042). Twenty per cent of the residents presented under-nutrition at the end of\\n      lockdown, but no specific risk factors could be identified. However, states of\\n      under-nutrition for the whole of 2020 were significantly more frequent than in\\n      2019, in particular severe cases (chi(2) = 5.43, p = 0.02). A history of\\n      under-nutrition in the previous year increased twofold the likelihood of\\n      under-nutrition in the following year (RR = 2.07, IC95 % = 1.14-3.74, p = 0.02). \\n      The Covid cluster period also had an effect on the functional autonomy of certain\\n      patients. Conclusion: Our main hypothesis relating to cognitive-behavioural\\n      dependence was not completely validated. The impact of the occurrence of the\\n      cluster remained moderate, in particular because of the care resources afforded\\n      by the nursing home.

The intervention\\n      of the hospitalization at home (HAH) in NH has been implemented in France to\\n      better fit the residents\\' needs and decrease the risk of hospitalization. No\\n      study has described the population of residents receiving this intervention. This\\n      study aimed to define the profile and the care pathway of residents and compare\\n      their characteristics according to the referrals (NH or hospitals). Methods: A\\n      retrospective study on 1,436 residents\\' stays in the intervention of the\\n      Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris\\'HAH in Ile de France between 2014 and 2019 \\n      was implemented. The Programme de Medicalisation des Systemes d\\'Information\\n      (PMSI) data was used for the analysis. Results: Residents were 88 years old with \\n      69 % of women with functional disability and the care was mainly represented by\\n      the complex dressing (68 %). For the care pathway, 65 % of the referrers were\\n      from the NH and 35 % from the hospital settings, 33 % of the residents died at\\n      the end of the stay in the NH and 25 % were transferred to hospitals. When the\\n      referrer was the hospital, the residents were mainly men (p < 0.001), younger (p \\n      < 0.001), receiving more often intravenous treatment and palliative care (p <\\n      0.01) with a higher level of indice of Karnofsky (p < 0.01). When the NH was the \\n      referrer, deaths were more frequent, whereas the transfers to hospitals were less\\n      common (p < 0.001). Discussion : Residents had complex clinical situation and\\n      their care pathway were different according to the referrer. From the NH, the HAH\\n      was used to provide more often end of life care, and from hospital setting, the\\n      residents received more acute care with a higher risk of readmission.

Fortified samples\\n      signified dose-dependent increases in their inhibition rates during the storage\\n      period, with significant differences between 10% fortifications on the 7 day of\\n      storage in favor of the samples fortified with P. torulosus. Explicitly, P.\\n      torulosus showed 16% higher DPPH and 62.5% higher LPO neutralizing activity than \\n      yogurt enriched with P. igniarius. However, prolonged refrigeration tended to\\n      equalize antioxidant profiles in both fortified yogurts. Total titratable acidity\\n      and pH levels of the fortified yogurts as most important parameters for consumer \\n      acceptance were unaltered during storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: It is a common \\n      scientific perception that bioactive compounds present in wild medicinal fungi\\n      are the main contributors for their in vitro antioxidant efficiency. On account\\n      of these attributes, Phellinus species have been exploited in Far East Asia as\\n      safe remedies for many disorders thus making them attractive fortifying\\n      ingredients; however, according to our knowledge these mushrooms have never been \\n      used as natural additives in beverages. Given the current popularity of yogurt\\n      consumption as seen from the global market profits, as well as experimental\\n      evidences of enhanced potency of extract in comparison with powder due to maximal\\n      bioavailability of antioxidants, it is our belief that this study will increase\\n      the interest in the manufacture of functional foods with extracts from wild\\n      mushrooms.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\\nFAU - Dimitrova-Shumkovska, Jasmina\\nAU  - Dimitrova-Shumkovska J\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6333-7669\\nAD  - Department of Experimental Biochemistry, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Natural\\n      Sciences and Mathematics, University Ss.

P. viticola secretes RxLR effectors to\\n      modulate immune responses in grapevine. Here, we report an RxLR effector\\n      RxLR50253 from P. viticola that can interfere with plant immune response and thus\\n      promote pathogen colonization. RxLR50253 was induced at an early stage of P.\\n      viticola infection and could suppress elicitor (INF1 and Bax)-triggered cell\\n      death. RxLR50253 promote pathogen colonization in both tobacco and grapevine\\n      leaves. VpBPA1 was found to be the host target of RxLR50253 by Y2H screening, and\\n      interaction between RxLR50253 and VpBPA1 was confirmed by multiple in vivo and in\\n      vitro assays. Further analysis revealed that VpBPA1 promoted pathogen\\n      colonization and decreased H2 O2 accumulation in transgenic tobacco and\\n      grapevine, while there was enhanced resistance and H2 O2 accumulation in\\n      NbBPA1-silenced N. benthamiana leaves. Moreover, transient expression of VpBPA1\\n      in NbBPA1-silenced N. benthamiana leaves could reduce the accumulation of H2 O2 .\\n      Experiments in vivo demonstrated that RxLR50253 inhibits degradation of VpBPA1.\\n      Taken together, our findings showed that RxLR50253 targets and stabilizes VpBPA1 \\n      to attenuate plant immunity through decreasing H2 O2 accumulation during pathogen\\n      infection.\\nCI  - This article is protected by copyright.

We report experience designing and implementing an enhanced recovery \\n      after surgery (ERAS) pathway for cleft palate repair to optimize postoperative\\n      recovery. AIMS: The primary aim was to implement an ERAS pathway with >70% bundle\\n      adherence to achieve a 30% reduction in postoperative opioid consumption within\\n      12 months. Our secondary aims assessed intraoperative opioid consumption, length \\n      of stay (LOS), timeliness of oral intake, and respiratory recovery. METHODS: A\\n      multidisciplinary team of perioperative providers developed an ERAS pathway for\\n      cleft palate patients. Key drivers included patient and provider education,\\n      formal pathway creation and implementation, multimodal pain therapy, and\\n      target-based care. Interventions included maxillary nerve blockade and enhanced\\n      intra- and postoperative medication regimens. Outcomes were displayed as\\n      statistical process control charts. RESULTS: Pathway compliance was 77.0%.\\n      Patients during the intervention period (n=39) experienced a 49% reduction in\\n      postoperative opioid consumption (p<0.0001) relative to our historical cohort\\n      (n=63), with a mean difference of -0.33 +/- 0.11 mg/kg (95% CI -0.55 to -0.12\\n      mg/kg). Intraoperative opioid consumption was reduced by 36% (p=0.002), with a\\n      mean difference of -0.27 +/- 0.09 mg/kg (95% CI -0.45 to -0.09 mg/kg).\\n      Additionally, patients in the intervention group had a 45% reduction in time to\\n      first oral intake (p=0.02) relative to our historical cohort, with a mean\\n      difference of -3.81 +/- 1.56 hours (95% CI -6.9 to -0.70). There was no\\n      difference in PACU or hospital LOS, but there was a significant reduction in\\n      variance of all secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Opioid reduction and improved\\n      timeliness of oral intake is possible with an ERAS protocol for cleft palate\\n      repair, but our protocol did not alter PACU or hospital LOS.\\nCI  - This article is protected by copyright.

Comparing the effect\\n      of viscous dietary fiber to non-viscous fiber from cereal sources: A systematic\\n      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\\nPG  - 1-35\\nLID - 10.1017/S0007114522002355 [doi]\\nAB  - Although compelling evidence from observational studies supports a positive\\n      association between consumption of cereal fiber and cardiovascular disease (CVD) \\n      risk reduction, randomized clinical trials (RCT)s often target viscous fiber type\\n      as the prospective contributor to lipid lowering to reduce CVD risk. The\\n      objective of our study is to compare the lipids lowering effects of viscous\\n      dietary fiber to non-viscous, cereal-type fiber in clinical studies. RCTs that\\n      evaluated the effect of viscous dietary fiber compared to non-viscous, cereal\\n      fiber on LDL cholesterol and alternative lipid markers, with duration of >/= 3\\n      weeks, in adults with or without hypercholesterolemia were included. Medline,\\n      EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register were searched through October\\n      19, 2021. Data was extracted and assessed by 2 independent reviewers. The generic\\n      inverse variance method with random effects model was utilized to pool the data\\n      which were expressed as mean differences (MD)s with 95% confidence intervals\\n      (CI). Eighty-nine trials met eligibility criteria (n = 4755). Mean differences\\n      for the effect of viscous dietary fiber compared to non-viscous cereal fiber\\n      were: LDL cholesterol (MD = -0.26 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.30, -0.22 mmol/L; P < 0.01),\\n      non-HDL cholesterol (MD = -0.33 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.39, -0.28 mmol/L; P < 0.01),\\n      and Apo-B (MD = -0.04 g/L; 95% CI: -0.06, -0.03 g/L; P < 0.01). Viscous dietary\\n      fiber reduces LDL cholesterol and alternative lipid markers relative to the fiber\\n      from cereal sources, hence may be a preferred type of fiber-based dietary\\n      intervention targeting cardiovascular disease risk reduction.\\nFAU -

The aim of the\\n      present study was to explore cross-sectional associations of the serum total n-6 \\n      PUFA, LA, arachidonic acid (AA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and\\n      dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) concentrations with ECP and its components. In\\n      total, 1685 men aged 42-60 years from the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk\\n      Factor Study and free of cardiovascular diseases were included. Analysis of\\n      covariance was used to examine the mean values of ECP (maximal oxygen uptake\\n      (VO2max)/maximal systolic blood pressure (SBP)) and its components in quartiles\\n      of the serum total and individual n-6 PUFA concentrations. After multivariable\\n      adjustments, higher serum total n-6 PUFA concentration was associated with higher\\n      ECP and VO2max [for ECP, the extreme-quartile difference was 0.77 mL/mmHg (95%CI \\n      0.38-1.16, P-trend across quartiles <0.001) and for VO2max 157 mL/min (95%CI\\n      85-230, P-trend<0.001)], but not with maximal SBP. Similar associations were\\n      observed with serum LA concentration. Higher serum AA concentration was\\n      associated with higher ECP but not with VO2max or maximal SBP. The minor serum\\n      n-6 PUFAs GLA and DGLA were associated with higher maximal SBP during exercise\\n      test and DGLA also with higher VO2max but neither with ECP.

For the first time this paper studies the\\n      effect of processing on the mechanical properties and in-vitro cell growth of\\n      controllably generating a hierarchical structure of macro- (94 +/- 6 to 514 +/-\\n      36 mum) and microporosity (2-30 mum) by the inclusion of camphene as a porogen\\n      during processing. Scaffolds were produced with porogen additions of 0-25 wt%.\\n      Porosity values of the structures of 85-96% were determined using the Archimedes \\n      technique and verified using X-ray Computed Tomography. The strength of the\\n      hydroxyapatite scaffolds, 5.70 +/- 1.0 to 159 +/- 61 kPa, correlated to\\n      theoretically determined values, 3.71 +/- 0.8 to 134 +/- 12 kPa, calculated by\\n      the novel incorporation of a shape factor into a standard equation. Fibroblast\\n      (3T3) and pre-osteoblast (MC3T3) cell growth was found to be significantly (P <\\n      0.005) improved using 25 wt% porogen. This was supported by increased levels of\\n      alkaline phosphatase and was thought to result from greater dissolution as\\n      quantified by increased calcium levels in incubating media. The combination of\\n      these properties renders adaptive foam reticulation-fabricated scaffolds suitable\\n      for non-structural bone regenerative applications in non-load bearing bone\\n      defects.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

In this\\n      work, we developed a poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-quaternary ammonium salt\\n      chitosan) hydrogel, named as p(HEMA-co-mHACC) hydrogel, using acryloyl HACC\\n      (mHACC) as a macromolecular crosslinker. With increasing the acryloyl\\n      substitution degree (14-29%) or mHACC content (2-11%), the hydrogel showed an\\n      enhanced tensile strength (432-986 kPa) and Young\\'s modulus (360-1158 kPa), a\\n      decreased elongation at break (242-84%), and an increased visible light\\n      transmittance (0-95%). At an optimal acryloyl substitution degree of 26%, with\\n      the increase of mHACC content from 2% to 11%, p(HEMA-co-mHACC) hydrogel presented\\n      a decreased water contact angle from 84.6 to 55.3 degree, an increased\\n      equilibrium water content from 38% to 45%, and an enhanced oxygen permeability\\n      from 8.5 to 13.5 barrer. Due to the enhancement in surface hydrophilicity and\\n      electropositivity, p(HEMA-co-mHACC) hydrogel remarkably reduced the deposition of\\n      lysozyme, but little affected the adsorption of BSA, depending on the\\n      hydrophilic/hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The antimicrobial test\\n      against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli showed that p(HEMA-co-mHACC)\\n      hydrogel presented an 8-32 times higher germicidal ability than pHEMA hydrogel,\\n      indicative of a better antimicrobial activity. The in vitro cell culture of mouse\\n      NIH3T3 fibroblasts and immortalized human keratinocytes showed that\\n      p(HEMA-co-mHACC) hydrogel was non-toxic. Thus, p(HEMA-co-mHACC) hydrogel with\\n      tear protein deposition resistance and antimicrobial activity is a potential\\n      candidate for contact lenses.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: A nationwide multicentre cohort study was\\n      conducted of all patients presenting to 17 hospitals in March-April 2020.\\n      Follow-up data were collected one year after initial hip fracture (\\'index\\')\\n      admission, including: COVID-19 status, readmissions, mortality, and cause of\\n      death. RESULTS: Data were available for 788/833 (94.6%) patients. One-year\\n      mortality was 242/788 (30.7%), and the prevalence of COVID-19 within 365 days of \\n      admission was 142/788 (18.0%). One-year mortality was higher for patients with\\n      COVID-19 (46.5% vs. 27.2%; p < 0.001), and highest for those COVID-positive\\n      during index admission versus after discharge (54.7% vs. 39.7%; p = 0.025).\\n      Anytime COVID-19 was independently associated with 50% increased mortality risk\\n      within a year of injury (HR 1.50, p = 0.006); adjusted mortality risk doubled (HR\\n      2.03, p < 0.001) for patients COVID-positive during index admission. No\\n      independent association was observed between mortality risk and COVID-19\\n      diagnosed following discharge (HR 1.16, p = 0.462). Most deaths (56/66; 84.8%) in\\n      COVID-positive patients occurred within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis (median\\n      11.0 days). Most cases diagnosed following discharge from the admission hospital \\n      occurred in downstream hospitals. CONCLUSION: Almost half the patients that had\\n      COVID-19 within 365 days of fracture had died within one year of injury versus\\n      27.2% of COVID-negative patients. Only COVID-19 diagnosed during the index\\n      admission was associated independently with an increased likelihood of death,\\n      indicating that infection during this time may represent a \\'double-hit\\' insult,\\n      and most COVID-related deaths occurred within 30 days of diagnosis.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

Enamel lacks the ability to\\n      self-repair due to the absence of enamel-producing cells in the erupted teeth.\\n      Here, we reported a novel approach to promote enamel-like tissue formation via\\n      the delivery of a key ameloblast inducer, T-box1 gene, into a rat dental\\n      epithelial stem cell line, HAT-7, using non-viral gene delivery systems based on \\n      cationic lipids. We comparatively assessed the lipoplexes prepared from\\n      glycyl-lysine-modified gemini surfactants and commercially available\\n      1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane lipids at three nitrogen-to phosphate\\n      (N/P) ratios of 2.5, 5 and 10. Our findings revealed that physico-chemical\\n      characteristics and biological activities of the gemini surfactant-based\\n      lipoplexes with a N/P ratio of 5 provide the most optimal outcomes among those\\n      examined. HAT-7 cells were transfected with T-box1 gene using the optimal\\n      formulation then cultured in conventional 2D cell culture systems. Ameloblast\\n      differentiation, mineralization, bio-enamel interface and structure were assessed\\n      at different time points over 28 days. Our results showed that our gemini\\n      transfection system provides superior gene expression compared to the benchmark\\n      agent, while keeping low cytotoxicity levels. T-box1-transfected HAT-7 cells\\n      strongly expressed markers of secretory and maturation stages of the ameloblasts,\\n      deposited minerals, and produced enamel-like crystals when compared to control\\n      cells. Taken together, our gemini surfactant-based T-box1 gene delivery system is\\n      effective to accelerate and guide ameloblastic differentiation of dental\\n      epithelial stem cells and promote enamel-like tissue formation. This study would \\n      represent a significant advance towards the tissue engineering and regeneration\\n      of dental enamel.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022.

However, bone\\n      scaffolds obtained by direct ink writing, one of the most promising approaches\\n      for the fabrication of personalized bone grafts, consist mostly of convex\\n      surfaces, since they are obtained by microextrusion of cylindrical strands. By\\n      modifying the geometry of the nozzle, it is possible to print 3D structures\\n      composed of non-cylindrical strands and favor the presence of concave surfaces.\\n      In this work, we compare the in vivo performance of 3D-printed calcium phosphate \\n      scaffolds with either conventional cylindrical strands or star-shaped strands, in\\n      a rabbit femoral condyle model. Monocortical defects, drilled in contralateral\\n      positions, are randomly grafted with the two scaffold configurations, with\\n      identical composition. The samples are explanted eight weeks post-surgery and\\n      assessed by mu-CT and resin-embedded histological observations. The results\\n      reveal that the scaffolds containing star-shaped strands have better\\n      osteoconductive properties, guiding the newly formed bone faster towards the core\\n      of the scaffolds, and enhance bone regeneration, although the increase is not\\n      statistically significant (p > 0.05). This new approach represents a turning\\n      point towards the optimization of pore shape in 3D-printed bone grafts, further\\n      boosting the possibilities that direct ink writing technology offers for\\n      patient-specific applications.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

To date, the development of functional antibacterial\\n      dressings for oral wound healing remains a challenge. In this regard, we\\n      investigated antibacterial silk protein-based membranes for the application as\\n      wound dressings in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The present study includes\\n      five variants of casted membranes, i.e., i) membranes-silver nanoparticles\\n      (CM-Ag), ii) membranes-gentamicin (CM-G), iii) membranes-control (without\\n      functionalization) (CM-C), iv) membranes-silk sericin control (CM-SSC), and v)\\n      membranes-silk fibroin/silk sericin (CM-SF/SS), and three variants of nonwovens, \\n      i.e., i) silver nanoparticles (NW-Ag), ii) gentamicin (NW-G), iii) control\\n      (without functionalization) (NW-C). The surface structure of the samples was\\n      visualized with scanning electron microscopy. In addition, antibacterial testing \\n      was accomplished using agar diffusion assay, colony forming unit (CFU) analysis, \\n      and qrt-PCR. Following antibacterial assays, biocompatibility was evaluated by\\n      cell proliferation assay (XTT), cytotoxicity assay (LDH), and live-dead assay on \\n      L929 mouse fibroblasts. Findings indicated significantly lower bacterial colony\\n      growth and DNA counts for CM-Ag with a reduction of bacterial counts by 3log\\n      levels (99.9% reduction) in CFU and qrt-PCR assay compared to untreated control\\n      membranes (CM-C and CM-SSC) and membranes functionalized with gentamicin (CM-G\\n      and NW-G) (p < 0.001). Similarly, NW-G yielded significantly lower DNA and colony\\n      growth counts compared to NW-Ag and NW-C (p < 0.001). In conclusion, CM-Ag\\n      represented 1log level better antibacterial activity compared to NW-G, whereas\\n      NW-G showed better cytocompatibility for L929 cells. As data suggest, these two\\n      membranes have the potential of application in the field of bacteria-free oral\\n      wound healing. However, provided that loading strategy and cytocompatibility are \\n      adjusted according to the antibacterial agents\\' characteristic and fabrication\\n      technique of the membranes.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

If visible,\\n      adenomyosis signs were documented in each trimester and post-partum. Mann Whitney\\n      U-tests or Chi-square tests were used for continuous/categorical variables\\n      respectively. RESULTS: A globular uterus was reported in 79% women with\\n      adenomyosis in the 1st trimester, in 38% and 2% women in the 2nd and 3rd\\n      trimester respectively and in the post-partum in 65% women. Asymmetrical\\n      thickening (30%) and cysts (23%) were only visible in 1st trimester. Adenomyosis \\n      was associated with miscarriage (OR 5.9, CI95% 2.4-14.9, p<0.001) also in normal \\n      conception only (OR 5.1 95%CI 1.8-14.2, p=0.002) or adjusting for maternal age\\n      (aOR 5.9, CI95% 2.3-15.2, p<0.001). Gestational age at delivery was lower in\\n      adenomyosis (p=0.004); the Caesarean Section (CS) rate was higher than in\\n      controls (OR 2.5, CI95% 1.3-4.8, p=0.007) also adjusting for age (aOR 2.07, CI95%\\n      1.06-4.08, p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Signs of adenomyosis were visible but\\n      progressively disappeared in pregnancy; adenomyosis was associated with an\\n      increased risk of early miscarriage.

The effects of testosterone on \\n      platelet biology are unknown, and platelets express both estradiol and androgen\\n      receptors on the plasma membrane. We hypothesize testosterone decreases platelet \\n      responses in vitro, and there are baseline differences in platelet function and\\n      metabolism stratified by sex/age. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis platelets\\n      were collected from: older males (OM) >/=45 years, younger males (YM) <45 years, \\n      older females (OF) >/=54 years, and younger females (YF) <54 years, and\\n      testosterone and estradiol were measured. Platelets were incubated with\\n      testosterone (5.31 ng/ml), estradiol (105 pg/ml) or vehicle and stimulated with\\n      buffer, adenosine diphosphate (20 muM), platelet activating factor (2 muM), or\\n      thrombin (0.3 U/ml). Aggregation, CD62P surface expression, fibrinogen receptor\\n      surface expression, and platelet mitochondrial metabolism were measured. RESULTS:\\n      Testosterone significantly inhibited aggregation in OF and OM (p < .05),\\n      inhibited CD41a expression in YF, YM, and OM (p < .05), and affected a few of the\\n      baseline amounts of CD62P surface expression but not platelet activation to\\n      platelet-activating factor and adenosine diphosphate, and variably changed\\n      platelet metabolism. DISCUSSION: Platelets have sex- and age-specific\\n      aggregation, receptor expression, and metabolism. Testosterone decreases platelet\\n      function dependent on the stimulus, age, and sex. Similarly, platelet metabolism \\n      has varying responses to sex hormones with baseline metabolic differences\\n      dependent upon sex and age.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 AABB.\\nFAU - Hadley, Jamie B\\nAU  - Hadley JB\\nAD  - The Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, USA.\\nFAU - Kelher, Marguerite R\\nAU  - Kelher MR\\nAD  - The Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado,\\n      USA.\\nAD  - Vitalant Research Institute, Denver, Colorado, USA.\\nFAU - Coleman, Julia R\\nAU  - Coleman JR\\nAD  - The Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, USA.\\nFAU - Kelly, Kathleen K\\nAU  - Kelly KK\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1102-6279\\nAD  - Vitalant Research Institute, Denver, Colorado, USA.\\nFAU - Dumont, Larry J\\nAU  - Dumont LJ\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1715-0748\\nAD  - Vitalant Research Institute, Denver, Colorado, USA.\\nAD  - The Department of Pathology School of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver,\\n      Aurora, Colorado, USA.\\nFAU - Esparza, Orlando\\nAU  - Esparza O\\nAD  - The Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado,\\n      USA.\\nAD  - Vitalant Research Institute, Denver, Colorado, USA.\\nFAU - Banerjee, Anirban\\nAU  - Banerjee A\\nAD  - The Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, USA.\\nFAU - Cohen, Mitchell J\\nAU  - Cohen MJ\\nAD  - The Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, USA.\\nFAU - Jones, Kenneth\\nAU  - Jones K\\nAD  - Department of Biostatistics, University of Oklahoma School of Medicine, Oklahoma \\n      City, Oklahoma, USA.\\nFAU - Silliman, Christopher C\\nAU  - Silliman CC\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1498-1933\\nAD  - The Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, USA.\\nAD  - The Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado,\\n      USA.\\nAD  - Vitalant Research Institute, Denver, Colorado, USA.\\nLA  - eng\\nGR  - UM1HL120877/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\\nGR  - NH/NIH HHS/United States\\nGR  - RM1GM131968/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States\\nGR  - T32GM008315/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Transfusion\\nJT  - Transfusion\\nJID - 0417360\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - estradiol\\nOT  - mitochondria\\nOT  - platelets\\nOT  - sex dimorphisms\\nOT  - testosterone\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 03:33\\nPHST- 2022/06/24 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/04/22 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/24 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 03:33 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1111/trf.17054 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Transfusion. 2022 Aug 5. doi: 10.1111/trf.17054.\\n\\nPMID- 35929188\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1532-849X (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1059-941X (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Translucency parameter and color masking ability of CAD/CAM denture base\\n      materials against metal substrates.\\nLID - 10.1111/jopr.13581 [doi]\\nAB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the translucency parameters of traditional, milled, and\\n      3D-printed denture base materials at 3 different thicknesses and the color\\n      masking ability of each material against a metallic background between different \\n      thicknesses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A traditional heat-polymerizing\\n      polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (H-Lucitone) material was used as the control\\n      group. Two milled pre-polymerized resin blocks (M-Lucitone and IvoBase) and five \\n      3D-printed denture base materials (P-Lucitone, Dentca LP, Dentca OP, Formlabs,\\n      and Kulzer) were used as experimental groups. A total of 240 samples, (n = 30,\\n      per material) were fabricated to a final specimen dimension of 12x12 mm and in\\n      thicknesses of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mm (n = 10 per thickness/material) according to \\n      the manufacturers\\' recommendations. The color coordinates (L*, a*, b*) in CIELab \\n      color space for all specimens placed against a white, black, and metallic\\n      background were measured with a spectrophotometer. The translucency parameters\\n      (TP00 ) at each thickness and the color differences between 1 mm and 2 mm\\n      (dE00M1-2 ) and between 2 mm and 3 mm (dE00M2-3 ) against the metallic background\\n      were calculated with the CIEDE2000 color matrix. Comparisons between the groups\\n      for differences in TP00 were made using One-way ANOVA separately for each\\n      thickness. Comparisons of groups and materials for differences in dE00M1-2 and\\n      dE00M2-3 were made using Two-way ANOVA and Fisher\\'s Protected Least Significant\\n      Differences (alpha = .05). RESULTS: The TP00 decreased with increasing thickness \\n      in all 8 material groups. All 3D-printed materials, except P-Lucitone, had higher\\n      TP00 than milled pre-polymerized resin materials (M-Lucitone and IvoBase), and\\n      traditional heat-polymerizing PMMA (H-Lucitone) material (P<.001) at all\\n      thicknesses. In the 1 mm and 2 mm thickness, heat-polymerizing acrylic resin\\n      (H-Lucitone) had the lowest TP00 , and in the 3 mm thickness, milled acrylic\\n      resin (M-Lucitone and IVOBase) had had lowest TP00 (P<.001). All material groups \\n      had significantly lower values of dE00M2-3 than dE00M1-2 (P<.001). The color\\n      differences dE00M2-3 were significantly lower in H-Lucitone, M-Lucitone,\\n      P-Lucitone, and IvoBase groups than in other materials, while the color\\n      difference of dE00M1-2 was significantly lower in H-Lucitone, P-Lucitone and\\n      Dentca LP than other materials (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study\\n      provide clinicians and dental technicians with information regarding the\\n      selection of denture base materials to achieve desired color masking outcomes,\\n      according to available prosthetic space. Thicker prostheses significantly\\n      improved the color masking abilities of denture acrylic resins against a metallic\\n      background. In a thickness of 1 and 2 mm, the heat-polymerizing acrylic resin had\\n      a lower translucency parameter and better color masking ability. When the\\n      prosthesis thickness reached 3 mm, the milled acrylic resin had a lower\\n      translucency parameter and better color masking ability. When compared to the\\n      heat-polymerizing resin and milled acrylic resin materials, except for one\\n      3D-printing resin (P-Lucitone), the color masking abilities of the remaining\\n      3D-printing resin materials were low, regardless of prosthesis thickness.

Transthyretin (TTR) amyloid is an often\\n      unrecognized and potentially modifiable mechanism for LSS that can also cause TTR\\n      cardiac amyloidosis. Accordingly, older adult patients undergoing lumbar spine\\n      (LS) surgery were evaluated for amyloid and if present, the precursor protein, as\\n      well as comprehensive characterization of the clinical phenotype. METHODS: A\\n      prospective, cohort study in 2 academic medical centers enrolled 47 subjects (age\\n      69 +/- 7 years, 53% male) undergoing clinically indicated LS decompression. The\\n      presence of amyloid was evaluated by Congo Red staining and in those with\\n      amyloid, precursor protein was determined by laser capture microdissection\\n      coupled to mass spectrometry (LCM-MS). The phenotype was assessed by\\n      disease-specific questionnaires (Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire and Kansas\\n      City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) and the 36-question short-form health survey, \\n      as well as biochemical measures (TTR, retinol-binding protein, and TTR\\n      stability). Cardiac testing included technetium-99m-pyrophosphate scintigraphy,\\n      electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and cardiac biomarkers as well as measures\\n      of functional capacity. RESULTS: Amyloid was detected in 16 samples (34% of\\n      participants) and was more common in those aged >/= 75 years of age (66.7%)\\n      compared with those <75 years (22.3%, p < 0.05). LCM-MS demonstrated TTR as the\\n      precursor protein in 62.5% of participants with amyloid while 37.5% had an\\n      indeterminant type of amyloid. Demographic, clinical, quality-of-life measures,\\n      electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and biochemical measures did not differ \\n      between those with and without amyloid. Among those with TTR amyloid (n = 10),\\n      one subject had cardiac involvement by scintigraphy. CONCLUSIONS: Amyloid is\\n      detected in more than a third of older adults undergoing LSS. Amyloid is more\\n      common with advancing age and is particularly common in those >75 years old. No\\n      demographic, clinical, biochemical, or cardiac parameter distinguished those with\\n      and without amyloid. In more than half of subjects with LS amyloid, the precursor\\n      protein was TTR indicating the importance of pathological assessment.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The American Geriatrics Society.\\nFAU - Maurer, Mathew S\\nAU  - Maurer MS\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Smiley, Dia\\nAU  - Smiley D\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Simsolo, Eli\\nAU  - Simsolo E\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Remotti, Fabrizio\\nAU  - Remotti F\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Bustamante, Angela\\nAU  - Bustamante A\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Teruya, Sergio\\nAU  - Teruya S\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Helmke, Stephen\\nAU  - Helmke S\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Einstein, Andrew J\\nAU  - Einstein AJ\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Lehman, Ronald\\nAU  - Lehman R\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Giles, Jon T\\nAU  - Giles JT\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Kelly, Jeffery W\\nAU  - Kelly JW\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Tsai, Felix\\nAU  - Tsai F\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Blaner, William S\\nAU  - Blaner WS\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Brun, Pierre-Jacques\\nAU  - Brun PJ\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Riesenburger, Ron I\\nAU  - Riesenburger RI\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Kryzanski, James\\nAU  - Kryzanski J\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Varga, Cindy\\nAU  - Varga C\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Patel, Ayan R\\nAU  - Patel AR\\nAD  - Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital, Scripps\\n      Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\\nLA  - eng\\nGR  - K24 AG036778/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States\\nGR  - R21 AG058348/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - J Am Geriatr Soc\\nJT  - Journal of the American Geriatrics Society\\nJID - 7503062\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - amyloidosis\\nOT  - cardiac\\nOT  - lumbar spinal stenosis\\nOT  - transthyretin\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 03:32\\nPHST- 2022/06/26 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/05/09 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/01 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 03:32 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1111/jgs.17976 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Am Geriatr Soc. 2022 Aug 5. doi: 10.1111/jgs.17976.\\n\\nPMID- 35929141\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1533-0338 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1533-0338 (Linking)\\nVI  - 21\\nDP  - 2022 Jan-Dec\\nTI  - Downregulation of TRIM33 Promotes Survival and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition \\n      in Gastric Cancer.\\nPG  - 15330338221114505\\nLID - 10.1177/15330338221114505 [doi]\\nAB  - Among all malignancies worldwide, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer \\n      with the third highest mortality rate. One of the main reasons for the low\\n      survival rate is the recurrence and metastasis that occurs in many patients after\\n      surgery. Numerous studies have shown that abnormal TRIM33 expression is\\n      associated with the progression of malignant tumors. TRIM33 can function either\\n      as a tumor suppressor or tumor promoter in different cancers. Our data showed\\n      that TRIM33 was highly expressed in stomach cancer, and in human gastric cancer\\n      tissues, low expression of TRIM33 was associated with poor prognosis in patients \\n      with gastric cancer. To clarify the function of TRIM33 in survival and\\n      epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer cells, we investigated the\\n      effect of TRIM33 knockdown in several gastric cancer cell lines. Downregulation\\n      of TRIM33 in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells enhanced the proliferation, colony\\n      formation, and migratory ability of these gastric cancer cells. It also promoted \\n      epithelial-mesenchymal transition; transfection of cells with siRNA targeting\\n      TRIM33 led to the upregulation of vimentin and N-Cadherin expression, and\\n      downregulation of E-Cadherin expression. Meanwhile, the transforming growth\\n      factor beta pathway was activated: levels of transforming growth factor beta were\\n      elevated and the expressions of p-Smad2, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 were activated. \\n      To confirm the role of TRIM33 in vivo, a xenograft model was established in nude \\n      mice. Immunohistochemical analysis identified that the protein levels of TRIM33, \\n      p-Smad2, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, vimentin, and N-Cadherin were increased, and\\n      E-Cadherin levels were decreased, in xenograft tumors from the si-TRIM33 group.\\n      Taken together, these results suggest that TRIM33 may be a potential marker for\\n      the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer. Furthermore, it may also serve as \\n      a novel target for gastric cancer treatment.\\nFAU - Wang, Fang\\nAU  - Wang F\\nAD  - Department of Gastroenterology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University,\\n      Yinchuan, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Wenjun\\nAU  - Wang W\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5922-455X\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Basic Medical School, 105002Ningxia Medical University, \\n      Yinchuan, China.\\nFAU - Wu, Xiaoting\\nAU  - Wu X\\nAD  - Department of Gastroenterology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University,\\n      Yinchuan, China.\\nFAU - Tang, Cui\\nAU  - Tang C\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4372-1361\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Basic Medical School, 105002Ningxia Medical University, \\n      Yinchuan, China.\\nFAU - Du, Fang\\nAU  - Du F\\nAD  - School of Information Engineering, 56693Ningxia University, Ningxia, China.\\nFAU - Lu, Zhiguo\\nAU  - Lu Z\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Surgery, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, \\n      Yinchuan, Ningxia, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Zhuoyang\\nAU  - Zhang Z\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Basic Medical School, 105002Ningxia Medical University, \\n      Yinchuan, China.\\nFAU - Xu, Hui\\nAU  - Xu H\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Basic Medical School, 105002Ningxia Medical University, \\n      Yinchuan, China.\\nFAU - Cao, Xiangmei\\nAU  - Cao X\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5231-4288\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Basic Medical School, 105002Ningxia Medical University, \\n      Yinchuan, China.\\nFAU - Li, P Andy\\nAU  - Li PA\\nAD  - Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Biomanufacturing Research Institute and\\n      Technological Enterprise (BRITE), North Carolina Central University, Durham, NC, \\n      USA.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Technol Cancer Res Treat\\nJT  - Technology in cancer research & treatment\\nJID - 101140941\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - EMT\\nOT  - Smad\\nOT  - TRIM33\\nOT  - gastric cancer\\nOT  - survival\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 03:23\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 03:23 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1177/15330338221114505 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2022 Jan-Dec;21:15330338221114505. doi:\\n      10.1177/15330338221114505.\\n\\nPMID- 35929137\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1533-0338 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1533-0338 (Linking)\\nVI  - 21\\nDP  - 2022 Jan-Dec\\nTI  - A Prognostic Nomogram for Predicting Overall Survival in Patients With Small-Cell\\n      Carcinoma of the Uterine Cervix: A SEER Population-Based Study.\\nPG  - 15330338221110673\\nLID - 10.1177/15330338221110673 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: This study aimed to develop a prognostic model based on the\\n      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to predict the\\n      overall survival (OS) of small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (SmCC).\\n      Methods: Between 1975 and 2016, a total of 401 patients were included, and their \\n      comprehensive sociodemographic and clinicopathological characteristics were\\n      collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to screen \\n      for independent prognostic factors. The identified factors were used to conduct a\\n      nomogram for predicting the OS of SmCC. The performance of the nomogram was\\n      determined using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC),\\n      concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA)\\n      metrics. Results: The median survival time of all patients was about 24 months\\n      (95% confidence interval [95% CI] [1.50-2.17]). Age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.693\\n      for 45-59 vs 21-34, 95% CI [1.140-2.513], P = .009; HR = 2.836 for 60-92 vs\\n      21-34, 95% CI [1.851-4.345], P < .001), positive nodes (HR = 2.384, 95% CI\\n      [1.437-3.955], P < .001), regional nodes number >/=12 (HR = 0.500, 95% CI\\n      [0.282-0.886], P = .018), and treatment method (HR = 0.409 for surgery vs no, 95%\\n      CI [0.267-0.628], P < .001; HR = 0.649 for chemotherapy vs no, 95% CI\\n      [0.478-0.881)], P = .006) were independent factors of OS. Young patients who had \\n      surgical resection or chemotherapy, negative lymph nodes, and regional lymph\\n      nodes >/=12 had a longer survival time. These clinical factors were utilized to\\n      construct a nomogram for predicting OS. The AUC and C-index were higher than 0.7,\\n      indicating the good discriminating ability of the nomogram. The calibrations were\\n      all around the 45-degree line, indicating excellent consistency between the\\n      prediction of the model and actual observations. The DCA plots supported the\\n      clinical utility of the nomogram. Conclusion: The constructed nomogram is\\n      expected to help predict the prognosis of SmCC and guide patient treatment.\\nFAU - Chen, Yusha\\nAU  - Chen Y\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7706-9976\\nAD  - Cervical Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Health Center, Fujian Maternity and\\n      Child Health Hospital, College of Clinical Medical for Obstetrics & Gynecology\\n      and Pediatrics, 74551Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Jiancui\\nAU  - Chen J\\nAD  - Cervical Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Health Center, Fujian Maternity and\\n      Child Health Hospital, College of Clinical Medical for Obstetrics & Gynecology\\n      and Pediatrics, 74551Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\\nFAU - Lin, Xiaoqian\\nAU  - Lin X\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics, Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital, College of \\n      Clinical Medical for Obstetrics & Gynecology and Pediatrics, 74551Fujian Medical \\n      University, Fuzhou, China.\\nFAU - Zheng, Jinwen\\nAU  - Zheng J\\nAD  - Cervical Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Health Center, Fujian Maternity and\\n      Child Health Hospital, College of Clinical Medical for Obstetrics & Gynecology\\n      and Pediatrics, 74551Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\\nFAU - Li, Suyu\\nAU  - Li S\\nAD  - 117724Department of Gynecology, Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital,\\n      College of Clinical Medical for Obstetrics & Gynecology and Pediatrics,\\n      74551Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\\nFAU - Zheng, Xiangqin\\nAU  - Zheng X\\nAD  - 117724Department of Gynecology, Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital,\\n      College of Clinical Medical for Obstetrics & Gynecology and Pediatrics,\\n      74551Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Technol Cancer Res Treat\\nJT  - Technology in cancer research & treatment\\nJID - 101140941\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - nomogram\\nOT  - overall survival\\nOT  - prognostic model\\nOT  - small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 03:22\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 03:22 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1177/15330338221110673 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2022 Jan-Dec;21:15330338221110673. doi:\\n      10.1177/15330338221110673.\\n\\nPMID- 35929131\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2159-8290 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2159-8274 (Linking)\\nVI  - 12\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - BCL10 Mutants: Architects of Oncogenic Signaling Provide a Blueprint for\\n      Precision Medicine.\\nPG  - 1844-1846\\nLID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-22-0614 [doi]\\nAB  - BCL10, a key activator of NF-kappaB downstream of oncogenic B-cell receptor\\n      signaling, is mutated in nearly 40% of the BN2/C1 genetic subtype of diffuse\\n      large B-cell lymphoma, but how these mutations function to augment signaling and \\n      their relevance to targeted precision medicine agents remains unclear.

In addition, there \\n      was a paucity of data about the degree of nephrotoxicity due to cisplatin in the \\n      study setting. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of\\n      cisplatin nephrotoxicity among cervical patients. METHODS: A retrospective\\n      cross-sectional study was conducted at the Cancer Treatment Centre of Kenyatta\\n      National Hospital among 100 cervical cancer patients treated with a cisplatin\\n      regimen. Simple random sampling was employed to the recruit medical record of\\n      patients. This study used a data abstraction tool to extract the patients\\'\\n      relevant socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. The data were analysed\\n      using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25.0 software. Frequency\\n      tables and figures were used to present the findings of the study. Binary\\n      logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with\\n      cisplatin nephrotoxicity. RESULTS: The study showed a mean age of 52.09 +/- 10.44\\n      years. The prevalence rate of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in cervical cancer\\n      patients was 45%. Of these patients, 36% and 9% patients had grade 1 and 2\\n      nephrotoxicities, respectively. Comorbidities (crude odd\\'s ratio (COR) = 3.05,\\n      95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-7.02, p = 0.011), hypertension (COR = 3.0, 95%\\n      CI = 1.1-7.8, p = 0.03), and more than three cycles of cisplatin treatment\\n      (adjusted odd\\'s ratio = 4.5, 95% CI = 1.19-17.0, p = 0.027) were significant\\n      factors of nephrotoxicity. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cisplatin-induced\\n      nephrotoxicity among cervical cancer patients was high in the study setting.\\n      Comorbidities, number of cycles and types of comorbidities were significant\\n      factors associated with cisplatin nephrotoxicity.\\nFAU - Isaaka, Joshua\\nAU  - Isaaka J\\nAD  - Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy and Health \\n      Sciences, 54663United States International University-Africa, Nairobi, Kenya.\\nFAU - Degu, Amsalu\\nAU  - Degu A\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6562-0548\\nAD  - Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy and Health \\n      Sciences, 54663United States International University-Africa, Nairobi, Kenya.\\nFAU - Kimani, Lawrence M\\nAU  - Kimani LM\\nAD  - Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy and Health \\n      Sciences, 54663United States International University-Africa, Nairobi, Kenya.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - England\\nTA  - J Oncol Pharm Pract\\nJT  - Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International\\n      Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners\\nJID - 9511372\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Cervical cancer\\nOT  - Kenyatta National Hospital\\nOT  - associated factors\\nOT  - cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 03:13\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 03:13 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1177/10781552221119417 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2022 Aug 5:10781552221119417. doi:\\n      10.1177/10781552221119417.\\n\\nPMID- 35929125\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1644-4345 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1506-9680 (Linking)\\nVI  - 25\\nIP  - 2\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Myocardial perfusion imaging single photon emission computed tomography may\\n      detect silent myocardial ischemia in patient with epilepsy.\\nPG  - 105-111\\nLID - 10.5603/NMR.a2022.0023 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to compare the myocardial perfusion \\n      imaging (MPI) with [99mTc]tetrofosmin stress - rest single-photon emission\\n      computer tomography (SPECT) of patients with epilepsy with matched control\\n      individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All 29 adult epileptic patients were receiving\\n      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for epilepsy. Thirty-two individuals matched for\\n      gender and age consisted of the control group. MPIs SPECT were performed, and\\n      myocardial summed scores were obtained during stress (SSS) and rest (SRS) images.\\n      Abnormal MPI was considered when SSS was >/= 4. In addition, the difference (SDS)\\n      between SSS and SRS was also assessed, which represents a rate of reversibility\\n      after stress. RESULTS: Twenty of 29 (68.97%) patients with epilepsy had abnormal \\n      MPI and 14/32 (43.75%) of the controls (p = 0.04). Among males, 18/23 patients\\n      and 11/25 controls had abnormal MPI (p = 0.01), with quite a significant\\n      difference for mean SSS between male patients and controls (p = 0.002).\\n      Furthermore, SDS comparison showed that irreversible abnormalities were more\\n      common in patients than in control individuals. A difference of inadequately\\n      compensated myocardial ischemia between patients treated with enzyme inducing\\n      AEDs and patients treated with valproic acid was also detected. CONCLUSIONS:\\n      Single-photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) may detect increased risk for \\n      coronary artery disease and further cardiovascular events in patients with\\n      epilepsy.

The purpose of this study was to compare the\\n      data obtained from planar lymphoscintigraphy (PL), single-photon emission\\n      computed tomography (SPECT), and SPECT with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) for\\n      preoperative SLN detection in patients with EC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of \\n      44 images in 22 patients with early-stage EC (22 PL, 9 SPECT and 13 SPECT/CT)\\n      were analyzed. The scans were performed in the period 2018-2020 at the Institute \\n      of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine in Skopje. Thirteen patients underwent PL\\n      and SPECT/CT and nine patients underwent PL and SPECT after cervical injection of\\n      4 mCi 99mTc-SENTI-SCINT on the day of surgery. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon\\n      Matched Pairs Test, and Spearman rank R coefficient were used for data analyses. \\n      RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with mean age of 61.1 +/- 7.5 and body mass index\\n      (BMI) 34.62 +/- 6.4 kg/m2 were included in the study. In four patients (18.2%)\\n      SLN was not detected on PL. Detection rate on SPECT and SPECT/CT was 100%. The\\n      average number of detected SLN was 1.4 +/- 1.05, 2.2 +/- 1.1 small i, Cyrillic\\n      2.15 +/- 1.1 on PL, SPECT and SPECT/CT respectively. We found a statistically\\n      significant difference in the number of detected SLNs on PL vs SPECT/CT (p =\\n      0.0077). The most common SLN location on SPECT/CT was the right internal iliac\\n      followed by the left common iliac region. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the\\n      presented study indicate a higher diagnostic value of SPECT/CT in terms of SLN\\n      detection and exact anatomic localization as compared to planar\\n      lymphoscintigraphy (PL).\\nFAU - Jankulovska, Anamarija\\nAU  - Jankulovska A\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-7261-5915\\nAD  - Institute of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine,\\n      University \"Ss Cyril and Methodius\", Skopje, North Macedonia.\\n      dr.jankulovska@gmail.com.\\nFAU - Stoilovska Rizova, Bojana\\nAU  - Stoilovska Rizova B\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7011-3949\\nAD  - Institute of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine,\\n      University \"Ss Cyril and Methodius\", Skopje, North Macedonia.\\nFAU - Bozhinovska, Nikolina\\nAU  - Bozhinovska N\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-1844-6839\\nAD  - Institute of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine,\\n      University \"Ss Cyril and Methodius\", Skopje, North Macedonia.\\nFAU - Peshevska, Aleksandra\\nAU  - Peshevska A\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-6417-6801\\nAD  - Institute of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine,\\n      University \"Ss Cyril and Methodius\", Skopje, North Macedonia.\\nFAU - Tanturovski, Mile\\nAU  - Tanturovski M\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-9837-4806\\nAD  - University Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology, Skopje, North Macedonia.\\nFAU - Aluloski, Igor\\nAU  - Aluloski I\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-6482-1014\\nAD  - University Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology, Skopje, North Macedonia.\\nFAU - Stojcevski, Sasho\\nAU  - Stojcevski S\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3221-9061\\nAD  - University Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology, Skopje, North Macedonia.\\nFAU - Manevska, Nevena\\nAU  - Manevska N\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7168-3775\\nAD  - Institute of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine,\\n      University \"Ss Cyril and Methodius\", Skopje, North Macedonia.\\nFAU - Stojanoski, Sinisa\\nAU  - Stojanoski S\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-4967-2102\\nAD  - Institute of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine,\\n      University \"Ss Cyril and Methodius\", Skopje, North Macedonia.\\nFAU - Miladinova, Daniela\\nAU  - Miladinova D\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7354-1308\\nAD  - Institute of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine,\\n      University \"Ss Cyril and Methodius\", Skopje, North Macedonia.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - Poland\\nTA  - Nucl Med Rev Cent East Eur\\nJT  - Nuclear medicine review.

The study aims\\n      to describe the characteristics of patients readmitted to an APCU. METHODS: This \\n      retrospective study examined patients with cancer readmitted within 30 days to an\\n      APCU. Readmissions were further classified as either potentially preventable or\\n      non-preventable. RESULTS: Out of 734 discharges from July 1, 2014 to July 1,\\n      2015, 69 (9%) readmissions were identified and analyzed. For index admissions,\\n      median length of stay was five days, and one (1%) was discharged home with\\n      hospice care. For readmissions, median time from index admission to readmission\\n      was nine days, median length of stay was six days, three (4%) patients died, and \\n      20 (30%) went home with hospice. Ten (14.5%) readmissions were deemed potentially\\n      preventable (95% CI 7.2-25.0%). Race/ethnicity-White/Black/Hispanic/Others-was\\n      60%, 10%, 20% and 10%, respectively, among potentially preventable readmissions\\n      and 76%, 22%, 2% and 0%, respectively, among potentially non-preventable\\n      readmissions (P = .012). Potentially preventable readmissions were more likely to\\n      have venous thromboembolism (40% vs. 12%, P = .046) and more reasons for\\n      readmission (median 2 vs. 1, P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with cancer\\n      readmitted to an APCU, one out of seven was potentially preventable and a far\\n      larger proportion was discharged with hospice care compared to the index\\n      admission. Recognition of disease course, meaningful goals of care discussions\\n      and timely transition to hospice care may reduce rehospitalization in this\\n      population.\\nFAU - El Hachem, Pierre\\nAU  - El Hachem P\\nAD  - Department of Palliative and Supportive Care, 2569Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland,\\n      OH, USA.\\nFAU - Pasniciuc, Silviu\\nAU  - Pasniciuc S\\nAD  - Department of Palliative and Supportive Care, 2569Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland,\\n      OH, USA.\\nFAU - Khurana, Saurabh\\nAU  - Khurana S\\nAD  - Department of Palliative and Supportive Care, 2569Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland,\\n      OH, USA.\\nFAU - Samala, Renato V\\nAU  - Samala RV\\nAD  - Department of Palliative and Supportive Care, 2569Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland,\\n      OH, USA.\\nFAU - Rybicki, Lisa A\\nAU  - Rybicki LA\\nAD  - Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, 2569Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, \\n      USA.\\nFAU - Lagman, Ruth L\\nAU  - Lagman RL\\nAD  - Department of Palliative and Supportive Care, 2569Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland,\\n      OH, USA.\\nFAU - Davis, Mellar P\\nAU  - Davis MP\\nAD  - Department of Palliative and Supportive Care, 2569Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland,\\n      OH, USA.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - J Palliat Care\\nJT  - Journal of palliative care\\nJID - 8610345\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - acute palliative care unit\\nOT  - cancer\\nOT  - palliative care\\nOT  - readmission\\nOT  - rehospitalization\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 03:13\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 03:13 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1177/08258597221119325 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - J Palliat Care. 2022 Aug 5:8258597221119325. doi: 10.1177/08258597221119325.\\n\\nPMID- 35929115\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2288-2405 (Print)\\nIS  - 2288-2405 (Linking)\\nVI  - 10\\nIP  - 3\\nDP  - 2022 Jul\\nTI  - Survival Outcomes and Predictors for Recurrence of Surgically Treated Brain\\n      Metastasis From Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.\\nPG  - 172-182\\nLID - 10.14791/btrt.2022.0016 [doi]\\nAB  - BACKGROUND: There are numerous factors to consider in deciding whether to undergo\\n      surgical treatment for brain metastasis from lung cancer. Herein, we aimed to\\n      analyze the survival outcome and predictors of recurrence of surgically treated\\n      brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A total of 197\\n      patients with brain metastasis from NSCLC who underwent microsurgery were\\n      included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 114 (57.9%) male and 83 (42.1%)\\n      female patients with a median age of 59 years (range, 27-79) was included in this\\n      study. The median follow-up period was 22.7 (range, 1-126) months. The 1-year and\\n      2-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with brain metastasis secondary to\\n      NSCLC were 59% and 43%, respectively. The 6-month and 1-year progression-free\\n      survival (PFS) rates of local recurrence were 80% and 73%, respectively, whereas \\n      those of distant recurrence were 84% and 63%, respectively. En-bloc resection of \\n      tumor resulted in better PFS for local recurrence (1-year PFS: 79% vs. 62%,\\n      p=0.02). Ventricular opening and direct contact between the tumor and the\\n      subarachnoid space were not associated with distal recurrence and leptomeningeal \\n      seeding. The difference in PFS of local recurrence according to adjuvant\\n      resection bed irradiation was not significant. Moreover, postoperative\\n      whole-brain irradiation did not show a significant difference in PFS of distant\\n      recurrence. In multivariate analysis, only en-bloc resection was a favorable\\n      prognostic factor for local recurrence. Contrastingly, multiple metastasis was a \\n      poor prognostic factor for distant recurrence. CONCLUSION: En-bloc resection may \\n      reduce local recurrence after surgical resection. Ventricular opening and contact\\n      between the tumor and subarachnoid space did not show a statistically significant\\n      result for distant recurrence and leptomeningeal seeding. Multiple metastasis was\\n      only meaningful factor for distant recurrence.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Korean Brain Tumor Society, The Korean Society for\\n      Neuro-Oncology, and The Korean Society for Pediatric Neuro-Oncology.\\nFAU - Byun, Joonho\\nAU  - Byun J\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0687-3286\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, Korea University Guro Hospital, Korea University\\n      College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. drjunho2@gmail.com.\\nFAU - Kim, Jong Hyun\\nAU  - Kim JH\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8300-9486\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, Korea University Guro Hospital, Korea University\\n      College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Kim, Moinay\\nAU  - Kim M\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6443-7098\\nAD  - Department of Neurological Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan\\n      College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Lee, Seungjoo\\nAU  - Lee S\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0641-3917\\nAD  - Department of Neurological Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan\\n      College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Kim, Young-Hoon\\nAU  - Kim YH\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8852-6503\\nAD  - Department of Neurological Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan\\n      College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Hong, Chang Ki\\nAU  - Hong CK\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2761-0373\\nAD  - Department of Neurological Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan\\n      College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Kim, Jeong Hoon\\nAU  - Kim JH\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7385-2368\\nAD  - Department of Neurological Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan\\n      College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - Korea (South)\\nTA  - Brain Tumor Res Treat\\nJT  - Brain tumor research and treatment\\nJID - 101627407\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Brain metastases\\nOT  - Lung cancer\\nOT  - Recurrence\\nOT  - Surgery\\nOT  - Survival\\nCOIS- The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 03:12\\nPHST- 2022/05/09 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/20 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/06/29 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 03:12 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.172 [pii]\\nAID - 10.14791/btrt.2022.0016 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Brain Tumor Res Treat. 2022 Jul;10(3):172-182. doi: 10.14791/btrt.2022.0016.\\n\\nPMID- 35929106\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2515-690X (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2515-690X (Linking)\\nVI  - 27\\nDP  - 2022 Jan-Dec\\nTI  - Hydroethanolic Extracts of Senna alata Leaves Possess Antimalarial Effects and\\n      Reverses Haematological and Biochemical Pertubation in Plasmodium\\n      berghei-infected Mice.\\nPG  - 2515690X221116407\\nLID - 10.1177/2515690X221116407 [doi]\\nAB  - The current work investigated the chemical profile, antimalarial potential and\\n      capacity of hydroethanolic Senna alata extract (SAE) to reverse hematological and\\n      biochemical pertubation in Plasmodium berghei infected mice. Results of the\\n      phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics,\\n      tannins, terpenoids, saponins, steroids and cardiac glycosides. Total phenolic\\n      and flavonoid content was estimated to be 45.29 +/- 2.34 mg GAE/g and 25.22 +/-\\n      2.26 mg QE/g respectively. In vitro analysis of the extract also confirmed its\\n      antioxidant property. Results of the test for prophylaxis of P. berghei indicated\\n      that SAE suppressed parasitemia significantly in treated groups in a dose\\n      dependent manner when compared with negative control group. Similarly, SAE\\n      improved the mean survival time (MST) and packed cell volume (PCV) of infected\\n      mice. The test for curative effect showed that SAE significantly suppressed\\n      parasitemia to 4.50 +/- 1.05% compared to untreated group 29.83 +/- 3.49%.\\n      Results of liver and kidney functions indices of treated animals indicated that\\n      whereas infection with P. berghei caused increase in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP,\\n      urea and creatinine, treatment with SAE significantly reversed the perturbation. \\n      Similarly, infected mice were dyslipidemic with concomitant increased activity of\\n      HMG CoA reductase and decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes with increase in \\n      lipid peroxides levels. However, these alterations were significantly reversed by\\n      administration of SAE. Results of this study shows that Senna alata possess\\n      antimalarial activity and therefore justify the traditional use of plant for the \\n      treatment of malaria.\\nFAU - Atanu, Francis O\\nAU  - Atanu FO\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0817-0106\\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry, 223207Faculty of Natural Sciences, Kogi State\\n      University, Anyigba, Nigeria.\\nFAU - Rotimi, Damilare\\nAU  - Rotimi D\\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences, 233773Landmark \\n      University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State, Nigeria.\\nFAU - Ilesanmi, Omotayo B\\nAU  - Ilesanmi OB\\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Federal University Otuoke,\\n      Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, Nigeria.\\nFAU - Al Malki, Jamila S\\nAU  - Al Malki JS\\nAD  - Department of Biology, College of Sciences, 125895Taif University, Taif, Saudi\\n      Arabia.\\nFAU - Batiha, Gaber E\\nAU  - Batiha GE\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,\\n      110146Damanhour University, Damanhour, Albeheira, Egypt.\\nFAU - Idakwoji, Precious A\\nAU  - Idakwoji PA\\nAD  - Department of Biochemistry, 223207Faculty of Natural Sciences, Kogi State\\n      University, Anyigba, Nigeria.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - J Evid Based Integr Med\\nJT  - Journal of evidence-based integrative medicine\\nJID - 101719675\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Senna alata\\nOT  - lipid metabolism\\nOT  - malaria\\nOT  - parasitemia\\nOT  - plasmodium\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 03:03\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 03:03 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1177/2515690X221116407 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - J Evid Based Integr Med. 2022 Jan-Dec;27:2515690X221116407. doi:\\n      10.1177/2515690X221116407.\\n\\nPMID- 35929100\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1537-2995 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0041-1132 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 4\\nTI  - Identification of a novel P1PK allele (A4GALT*c.1-504_1044del1548) in two Chinese\\n      sisters with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion.\\nLID - 10.1111/trf.17050 [doi]\\nFAU - Jia, Shuangshuang\\nAU  - Jia S\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0092-8576\\nAD  - Institute of Clinical Blood Transfusion, Guangzhou Blood Center, Guangzhou,\\n      China.\\nAD  - The Key Medical Laboratory of Guangzhou, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Li, Si\\nAU  - Li S\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1452-5847\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics, the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen\\n      University, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Liao, Zhijian\\nAU  - Liao Z\\nAD  - Institute of Clinical Blood Transfusion, Guangzhou Blood Center, Guangzhou,\\n      China.\\nAD  - The Key Medical Laboratory of Guangzhou, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Mo, Chunyan\\nAU  - Mo C\\nAD  - Institute of Clinical Blood Transfusion, Guangzhou Blood Center, Guangzhou,\\n      China.\\nAD  - The Key Medical Laboratory of Guangzhou, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Fang, Qun\\nAU  - Fang Q\\nAD  - Foetal Medicine Centre, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, \\n      Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Luo, Guangping\\nAU  - Luo G\\nAD  - Institute of Clinical Blood Transfusion, Guangzhou Blood Center, Guangzhou,\\n      China.\\nAD  - The Key Medical Laboratory of Guangzhou, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Ji, Yanli\\nAU  - Ji Y\\nAD  - Institute of Clinical Blood Transfusion, Guangzhou Blood Center, Guangzhou,\\n      China.\\nAD  - The Key Medical Laboratory of Guangzhou, Guangzhou, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nGR  - Key Medical Disciplines and Specialties Program of Guangzhou (2021-2023),\\n      Guangdong, China\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220804\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Transfusion\\nJT  - Transfusion\\nJID - 0417360\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - novel P1PK allele\\nOT  - p phenotype\\nOT  - recurrent spontaneous abortion\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 03:02\\nPHST- 2022/06/22 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/04/13 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/27 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 03:02 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1111/trf.17050 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Transfusion. 2022 Aug 4. doi: 10.1111/trf.17050.\\n\\nPMID- 35929093\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1598-9100 (Print)\\nIS  - 1598-9100 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 8\\nTI  - Concomitant ankylosing spondylitis can increase the risk of biologics or small\\n      molecule therapies to control inflammatory bowel disease.\\nLID - 10.5217/ir.2022.00057 [doi]\\nAB  - Background/Aims: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are diagnosed\\n      with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) often. However, the disease course of patients\\n      with both IBD and AS is not well understood. This study aims to evaluate the\\n      effect of concomitant AS on IBD outcomes. Methods: Among the 4,722 patients with \\n      IBD who were treated in 3 academic hospitals from 2004 to 2021, 55 were also\\n      diagnosed with AS (IBD-AS group). Based on patients\\' electronic medical records, \\n      the outcomes of IBD in IBD-AS group and IBD group without AS (IBD-only group)\\n      were appraised. Results: The proportion of patients treated with biologics or\\n      small molecule therapies was significantly higher in IBD-AS group than the\\n      proportion in IBD-only group (27.3% vs. 12.7%, P= 0.036). Patients with both\\n      ulcerative colitis and AS had a significantly higher risk of biologics or small\\n      molecule therapies than patients with only ulcerative colitis (P< 0.001). For\\n      univariable logistic regression, biologics or small molecule therapies were\\n      associated with concomitant AS (odds ratio, 4.099; 95% confidence interval,\\n      1.863-9.021; P< 0.001) and Crohn\\'s disease (odds ratio, 3.552; 95% confidence\\n      interval, 1.590-7.934; P= 0.002). Conclusions: Concomitant AS is associated with \\n      the high possibility of biologics or small molecule therapies for IBD. IBD\\n      patients who also had AS may need more careful examination and active treatment\\n      to alleviate the severity of IBD.\\nFAU - Jun, Yu Kyung\\nAU  - Jun YK\\nAD  - Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National\\n      University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.\\nFAU - Yoon, Hyuk\\nAU  - Yoon H\\nAD  - Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National\\n      University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.\\nAD  - Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Koh, Seong-Joon\\nAU  - Koh SJ\\nAD  - Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nAD  - Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National\\n      University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Kim, A Hyeon\\nAU  - Kim AH\\nAD  - Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Kim, Kwang Woo\\nAU  - Kim KW\\nAD  - Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nAD  - Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, SMG-SNU Boramae\\n      Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Park, Jun Won\\nAU  - Park JW\\nAD  - Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nAD  - Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National\\n      University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Lee, Hyun Jung\\nAU  - Lee HJ\\nAD  - Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nAD  - Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National\\n      University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Kang, Hyoun Woo\\nAU  - Kang HW\\nAD  - Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nAD  - Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, SMG-SNU Boramae\\n      Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Im, Jong Pil\\nAU  - Im JP\\nAD  - Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nAD  - Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National\\n      University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.\\nFAU - Park, Young Soo\\nAU  - Park YS\\nAD  - Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National\\n      University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.\\nFAU - Kim, Joo Sung\\nAU  - Kim JS\\nAD  - Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.\\nAD  - Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National\\n      University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.\\nCN  - Seoul National University Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Network (SIRN)\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220808\\nPL  - Korea (South)\\nTA  - Intest Res\\nJT  - Intestinal research\\nJID - 101572802\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Biological products\\nOT  - Colitis, ulcerative\\nOT  - Crohn disease\\nOT  - Inflammatory bowel diseases\\nOT  - Spondylitis, ankylosing\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:53\\nPHST- 2022/04/22 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/10 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:53 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - ir.2022.00057 [pii]\\nAID - 10.5217/ir.2022.00057 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Intest Res. 2022 Aug 8. pii: ir.2022.00057. doi: 10.5217/ir.2022.00057.\\n\\nPMID- 35929091\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1598-9100 (Print)\\nIS  - 1598-9100 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 8\\nTI  - Abdominal aortic calcification in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: does \\n      anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha use protect from chronic inflammation-induced\\n      atherosclerosis?\\nLID - 10.5217/ir.2022.00017 [doi]\\nAB  - Background/Aims: Abdominal aortic calcium (AAC) deposition has been suggested as \\n      a marker of early atherosclerosis. There is no published data on the evaluation\\n      of AAC in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: AAC was quantified by\\n      computed tomography or enterography scans performed in 98 IBD patients and 1:1\\n      age and sex matched controls. AAC deposition was correlated with IBD\\n      characteristics, disease activity or severity parameters, laboratory tests and\\n      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Results: Moderate-severe grade of AAC \\n      was found in 35.7% of IBD patients compared to 30.6% of controls (P= 0.544). IBD \\n      with CVD and ulcerative colitis patients had significantly higher rates of more\\n      severe atherosclerotic lesions (P= 0.001 and P= 0.01, respectively). AAC\\n      deposition was similarly distributed in age groups ( < 45, 45-64, and >/= 65\\n      years) among patients and controls. Multivariate analysis after excluding CVD\\n      risk confounders for non-CVD patients found extensive disease (P= 0.019) and\\n      lifetime steroids (P= 0.04) as independent risk factors for AAC. Anti-tumor\\n      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) use was negatively associated with AAC\\n      deposition in non-CVD IBD patients (odds ratio, 0.023; 95% confidence interval,\\n      0.001-0.594; P= 0.023). Conclusions: More than one-third of IBD patients have\\n      moderate to severe AAC. Better control of inflammation with anti-TNF-alpha agents\\n      seems to protect IBD patients from ACC deposition and subsequent atherosclerosis.\\nFAU - Mantaka, Aikaterini\\nAU  - Mantaka A\\nAD  - Faculty of Medicine, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.\\nAD  - Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Heraklion, Medical School,\\n      University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.\\nFAU - Galanakis, Nikolaos\\nAU  - Galanakis N\\nAD  - Interventional Radiology Unit, Department of Medical Imaging, University Hospital\\n      of Heraklion, Medical School, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.\\nFAU - Tsetis, Dimitrios\\nAU  - Tsetis D\\nAD  - Faculty of Medicine, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.\\nAD  - Interventional Radiology Unit, Department of Medical Imaging, University Hospital\\n      of Heraklion, Medical School, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.\\nFAU - Koutroubakis, Ioannis E\\nAU  - Koutroubakis IE\\nAD  - Faculty of Medicine, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.\\nAD  - Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Heraklion, Medical School,\\n      University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220808\\nPL  - Korea (South)\\nTA  - Intest Res\\nJT  - Intestinal research\\nJID - 101572802\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Abdominal aortic calcium\\nOT  - Atherosclerosis\\nOT  - Colitis, ulcerative\\nOT  - Crohn disease\\nOT  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:53\\nPHST- 2022/02/06 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/05/12 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:53 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - ir.2022.00017 [pii]\\nAID - 10.5217/ir.2022.00017 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Intest Res. 2022 Aug 8. pii: ir.2022.00017. doi: 10.5217/ir.2022.00017.\\n\\nPMID- 35929082\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1532-1738 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1082-0132 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 4\\nTI  - Effect of ultra violet (UV-C) and cold storage on orange juice quality.\\nPG  - 10820132221117750\\nLID - 10.1177/10820132221117750 [doi]\\nAB  - The effect of the UV-C treatment on the physico-chemical characteristics, pectin \\n      methylesterase activity (PME) as well as microbial quality of orange juice,\\n      compared to fresh juice, was studied.

The elastic \\n      modulus of the frontal white matter in males was significantly lower than in\\n      females (11.67 +/- 0.98 versus 12.25 +/- 1.31, P = .030), but the shear wave\\n      velocity of the thalamus in males was significantly lower than in females (1.18\\n      +/- 0.13 versus 1.82 +/- 0.10, P < .001). There was no significant correlation\\n      between real-time body weight and brain tissue elasticity including elastic\\n      modulus and shear wave velocity. But, the shear wave velocity of parietal white\\n      matter (r = 0.319, P = .014) and thalamus (r = -0.268, P = .040) and the elastic \\n      modulus of parietal white matter (r = 0.356, P = .006) were correlated with\\n      corrected gestational age.

BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience reduced exercise\\n      tolerance that substantially reduces quality of life. The mechanisms underpinning\\n      exercise intolerance in MS are not fully clear. This study aimed to determine the\\n      contributions of the cardiopulmonary system and peripheral muscle in MS-induced\\n      exercise intolerance before and after exercise training. METHODS: Twenty-three\\n      patients with MS (13 women) and 20 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls\\n      (13 women) performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Muscle fibre type\\n      composition, size, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, capillarity, and gene \\n      expression and proteins related to mitochondrial density were determined in\\n      vastus lateralis muscle biopsies. Nine MS patients (five women) were re-examined \\n      following a 12 week exercise training programme consisting of high-intensity\\n      cycling interval and resistance training. RESULTS: Patients with MS had lower\\n      maximal oxygen uptake compared with healthy controls (VO2peak , 25.0 +/- 8.5 vs. \\n      35.7 +/- 6.4 mL/kg/min, P < 0.001). The lower gas exchange threshold (MS: 14.5\\n      +/- 5.5 vs. controls: 19.7 +/- 2.9 mL/kg/min, P = 0.01) and slope of VO2 versus\\n      work rate (MS: 9.5 +/- 1.7 vs. controls: 10.8 +/- 1.1 mL/min/W, P = 0.01)\\n      suggested an intramuscular contribution to exercise intolerance in patients with \\n      MS. Muscle SDH activity was 22% lower in MS (P = 0.004), and strongly correlated \\n      with several indices of whole-body exercise capacity in MS patients (e.g. VO2peak\\n      , Spearman\\'s rho = 0.81, P = 0.002), but not healthy controls (rho = 0.24, P =\\n      0.38). In addition, protein levels of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes I (-40%, P =\\n      0.047) and II (-45%, P = 0.026) were lower in MS patients versus controls. Muscle\\n      capillary/fibre ratio correlated with VO2peak in healthy controls (rho = 0.86, P \\n      < 0.001) but not in MS (rho = 0.35, P = 0.22), and did not differ between groups \\n      (1.41 +/- 0.30 vs. 1.47 +/- 0.38, P = 0.65). Expression of genes involved in\\n      mitochondrial function, such as PPARA, PPARG, and TFAM, was markedly reduced in\\n      muscle tissue samples of MS patients (all P < 0.05). No differences in muscle\\n      fibre type composition or size were observed between groups (all P > 0.05).\\n      VO2peak increased by 23% following exercise training in MS (P < 0.001); however, \\n      no changes in muscle capillarity, SDH activity, gene or protein expression were\\n      observed (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle oxidative phenotype\\n      (mitochondrial complex I and II content, SDH activity) is lower in patients with \\n      MS, contributing to reduced exercise tolerance.

The aim was to determine the association between postoperative\\n      complications and survival in breast cancer. METHODS: This population-based\\n      cohort included women operated for T1-3 N0-3 M0 invasive breast cancer in Sweden \\n      from 2008 to 2017. Only major surgical postoperative complications leading to\\n      readmission and/or reoperation within 30 days were considered. Main outcomes were\\n      overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Prospectively\\n      collected nationwide register data were used. Multivariable Cox models were\\n      adjusted for clinical and socioeconomic confounders and co-morbidity. RESULTS:\\n      Among 57 152 women, major surgical postoperative complications were registered\\n      for 1854 patients. Median follow-up was 6.22 (0.09-11.70) years. Overall, 9163\\n      patients died, and 3472 died from breast cancer. Major surgical postoperative\\n      complications were more common after mastectomy with or without immediate\\n      reconstruction (7.3 and 4.3 per cent respectively) than after breast-conserving\\n      surgery (2.3 per cent). Unadjusted 5-year OS and BCSS rates were 82.6 (95 per\\n      cent c.i. 80.8 to 84.5) and 92.1 (90.8 to 93.5) per cent respectively for women\\n      with a major surgical postoperative complication, and 88.8 (88.6 to 89.1) and\\n      95.0 (94.8 to 95.2) per cent for those without a complication (P < 0.001). After \\n      adjustment, all-cause and breast cancer mortality rates remained higher after a\\n      major surgical postoperative complication (OS: HR 1.32, 95 per cent c.i. 1.15 to \\n      1.51; BCSS: HR 1.31, 1.04 to 1.65). After stratification for type of breast\\n      surgery, this association remained significant only for women who had mastectomy \\n      without reconstruction (OS: HR 1.41, 1.20 to 1.66; BCSS: HR 1.36, 1.03 to 1.79). \\n      CONCLUSION: Major surgical postoperative complications are associated with\\n      inferior survival, especially after mastectomy. These results underline the\\n      importance of surgical de-escalation.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Patients with\\n      both diagnoses might need to have a more targeted approach to reduce the\\n      symptomatic burden and severity of disease. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to\\n      explore the relationship between specific allergen sensitization, and asthma\\n      diagnosis and severity with the hypothesis that patients who tested positive to a\\n      higher allergy class of response and to more allergens would be more likely to\\n      have severe asthma. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 1419 charts \\n      that had a positive IgE allergy class blood test between 2014 and 2018. A total\\n      of 701 patients had one or more positive tests and a diagnosis of asthma. Patient\\n      demographics and pertinent variables including all clinic and ED visits, specific\\n      allergy and class of response, and information related to their asthma treatment \\n      and severity were recorded. Logistic regression was used to analyze the\\n      likelihood of asthma diagnosis, concomitant diagnosis of asthma and allergic\\n      rhinitis, and measures of asthma severity. RESULTS: Higher class of response to\\n      cat dander 1.24 (1.09, 1.41), dog dander 1.29 (1.13, 1.47), lamb\\'s quarter 1.35\\n      (1.06, 1.70), house dust 1.41 (1.11, 1.82), Cladosporium herbarum 1.35 (1.07,\\n      1.67) or cockroach 1.56 (1.00, 2.44) showed increased odds of hospitalizations.\\n      There was a statistically significant difference between the average number of\\n      classes for patients with and without asthma (P < .001), and those with and\\n      without steroids (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that positivity to cat\\n      dander, dog dander, some fungus, and house dust was associated with more severe\\n      asthma.\\nFAU - Benninger, Michael S\\nAU  - Benninger MS\\nAD  - Head and Neck Institute, 2569Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.\\nFAU - Cabrera, Claudia I\\nAU  - Cabrera CI\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0645-8130\\nAD  - Head and Neck Institute, 2569Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.\\nAD  - Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, 114516University Hospitals\\n      Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio.\\nFAU - Amador, Eulalia M\\nAU  - Amador EM\\nAD  - Head and Neck Institute, 2569Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.\\nFAU - Grafmiller, Kevin\\nAU  - Grafmiller K\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9238-6569\\nAD  - Head and Neck Institute, 2569Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.\\nFAU - Sindwani, Raj\\nAU  - Sindwani R\\nAD  - Head and Neck Institute, 2569Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220804\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Am J Rhinol Allergy\\nJT  - American journal of rhinology & allergy\\nJID - 101490775\\nSB  - IM\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - IgE\\nOT  - allergic rhinitis\\nOT  - allergies\\nOT  - asthma\\nOT  - asthma phenotypes\\nOT  - class response\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:33\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:33 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1177/19458924221112316 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Am J Rhinol Allergy. 2022 Aug 4:19458924221112316. doi:\\n      10.1177/19458924221112316.\\n\\nPMID- 35929043\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1559-6834 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0899-823X (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Aug 5\\nTI  - Serratia marcescens outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit associated with\\n      contaminated donor milk.\\nPG  - 1-7\\nLID - 10.1017/ice.2022.187 [doi]\\nAB  - OBJECTIVE: Investigation of the origin of a Serratia marcescens outbreak in a\\n      neonatal intensive care unit. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. SETTING: \\n      Regional level 3 perinatal center in Germany. PATIENTS: This study included 4 S. \\n      marcescens-positive and 19 S. marcescens-negative neonates treated between\\n      February 1 and February 26, 2019, in the neonatal intensive care unit. METHODS: A\\n      case-control study was performed to identify the source of the outbreak. The\\n      molecular investigation of S. marcescens isolates collected during the outbreak\\n      was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and next-generation\\n      sequencing. RESULTS: The retrospective case-control study showed a significant\\n      correlation (P < .0001) between S. marcensens infection or colonization and\\n      consumption of donor milk that had tested negative for pathogenic bacteria from a\\n      single breast milk donor. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and next-generation\\n      sequencing retrospectively confirmed an S. marcescens strain isolated from the\\n      breast milk of this donor as the possible origin of the initial outbreak. The\\n      outbreak was controlled by the implementation of an infection control bundle\\n      including a multidisciplinary infection control team, temporary nutrition of\\n      infants with formula only and/or their mother\\'s own milk, repeated screening of\\n      all inpatients, strict coat and glove care, process observation, retraining of\\n      hand hygiene and continuous monitoring of environmental cleaning procedures.\\n      CONCLUSIONS: Low-level contaminated raw donor milk can be a source of infection\\n      and colonization of preterm infants with S. marcescens even if it tests negative \\n      for bacteria.\\nFAU - Bechmann, Lukas\\nAU  - Bechmann L\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8144-5033\\nAD  - Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Otto-von-Guericke\\n      UniversityMagdeburg, Germany.\\nFAU - Bottger, Ralf\\nAU  - Bottger R\\nAD  - Department of Pediatrics, Otto-von-Guericke UniversityMagdeburg, Germany.\\nFAU - Baier, Claas\\nAU  - Baier C\\nAD  - Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hospital Epidemiology, Hannover Medical\\n      School (MHH), Germany.\\nFAU - Tersteegen, Aljoscha\\nAU  - Tersteegen A\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2602-2040\\nAD  - Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Otto-von-Guericke\\n      UniversityMagdeburg, Germany.\\nFAU - Bauer, Katja\\nAU  - Bauer K\\nAD  - Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Otto-von-Guericke\\n      UniversityMagdeburg, Germany.\\nFAU - Kaasch, Achim J\\nAU  - Kaasch AJ\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6659-6738\\nAD  - Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Otto-von-Guericke\\n      UniversityMagdeburg, Germany.\\nFAU - Geginat, Gernot\\nAU  - Geginat G\\nAD  - Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Otto-von-Guericke\\n      UniversityMagdeburg, Germany.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220805\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol\\nJT  - Infection control and hospital epidemiology\\nJID - 8804099\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:33\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:33 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - S0899823X22001878 [pii]\\nAID - 10.1017/ice.2022.187 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2022 Aug 5:1-7. doi: 10.1017/ice.2022.187.\\n\\nPMID- 35929042\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1019-5149 (Print)\\nIS  - 1019-5149 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Mar 15\\nTI  - Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Overshadowed by Traumatic and Degenerative Spinal\\n      Diseases: A New Assessment Proposal.\\nLID - 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.37051-21.3 [doi]\\nAB  - AIM: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a rare disorder among the elderly,\\n      characterized by gait disorder, dementia, and urinary incontinence. Considering\\n      the rareness of NPH and a lot of other pathologies, such as Parkinson\\'s disease, \\n      lumbar spinal stenosis, and even aging cause similar symptoms, NPH is an\\n      underdiagnosed entity. However, the percentage of misdiagnosis is not given in\\n      the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, patients diagnosed with NPH \\n      were retrospectively screened between 2015 and May 2019 in our clinical database \\n      and Ste-P formula was applied. Example cases showed that some of the patients\\n      receive inaccurate medical and surgical treatments before being diagnosed with\\n      NPH. RESULTS: As a result of the study was seen that a few out of 29 patients\\n      confused dizziness with trunkal ataxia or imbalance due to gait abnormality. As\\n      the time between onset of complaints and diagnosis increased, the value\\n      approached \"zero\", and diagnosis became difficult. CONCLUSION: Every unnecessary \\n      operation carries serious risks that may threaten the life of the patient and\\n      decrease the quality of life.

In the present study, we aimed to explore\\n      whether the combination regimen of dexmedetomidine (Dex) and butorphanol (But)\\n      could benefit patients with TBI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 208 TBI\\n      patients admitted from February 2018 to January 2020 were randomly divided into\\n      four groups as follows: control group (A), Dex group (B), But group (C), and\\n      combination of Dex and But group (D).

RESULTS: The statistical data of vital signs and\\n      blood oxygen saturation of the four groups were compared, and the differences\\n      between group A and group D were statistically significant (P 0.05), indicating\\n      that a combination of sedative and analgesic agents at low doses could improve\\n      the vital signs of TBI patients, and the safety was relatively good.

It is present in\\n      approximately 70-80% of healthy humans. The absence of an ITA has been considered\\n      as a midline defect of the brain associated with schizophrenia. The aim of the\\n      present study was to determine the prevalence, location, and dimensions of ITAs\\n      in Indian brains. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 100 brains (50 cadaveric and \\n      50 MR images) in the midsagittal plane for the presence or absence of ITAs, their\\n      location in the lateral wall of the third ventricle, and dimensions. RESULTS: ITA\\n      found in 87 brains (87%), four showed duplication (4%). Both its duplication and \\n      absence were more frequent among male. It was most commonly located in the\\n      anterosuperior quadrant with posterosuperior extension. The mean of horizontal\\n      diameter (7.13+/-4.31 mm) was longer than the vertical (5.13 +/-3.17) in all the \\n      brains. Its average area (37.98+/-41.47 mm2) showed huge variation (ranges\\n      between 4.40 mm2 to 203 mm2) and was significantly higher in females\\n      (61.23+/-56.22 mm2) than males (36.44+/-43.21 mm2) (p = 0.026). No correlation\\n      was found between the surface area of the ITA and the length of the third\\n      ventricle. CONCLUSION: Absence and duplication of ITA are fairly common in Indian\\n      brains with significant male predominance. Morphometric data are robust to\\n      advocate for the presence of sex differences in the ITA size, although not\\n      associated with surrounding thalamic or third ventricle anatomy.\\nFAU - Patra, Apurba\\nAU  - Patra A\\nAD  - All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Anatomy, Bathinda, India.\\nFAU - Kumar, Satish Ravi\\nAU  - Kumar SR\\nFAU - Tubbs, R Shane\\nAU  - Tubbs RS\\nFAU - Nandolia, Khanak\\nAU  - Nandolia K\\nFAU - Asghar, Adil\\nAU  - Asghar A\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220125\\nPL  - Turkey\\nTA  - Turk Neurosurg\\nJT  - Turkish neurosurgery\\nJID - 9423821\\nSB  - IM\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:32\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:32 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.36551-21.2 [doi]\\nPST - aheadofprint\\nSO  - Turk Neurosurg. 2022 Jan 25. doi: 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.36551-21.2.\\n\\nPMID- 35929031\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- Publisher\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1019-5149 (Print)\\nIS  - 1019-5149 (Linking)\\nDP  - 2022 Jan 7\\nTI  - Efficacy of Combined Dorsal Root Ganglion Pulsed Radiofrequency and Cervical\\n      Epidural Steroid Injection on Radicular Neck Pain.\\nLID - 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.36295-21.3 [doi]\\nAB  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined transforaminal anterior\\n      epidural steroid injection (TAESI) and dorsal root ganglion pulsed radiofrequency\\n      (DRG-PRF) therapy on the radicular neck pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The results\\n      of 84 patients with cervical radicular pain who underwent combined DRG-PRF and\\n      TAESI under fluoroscopy were evaluated retrospectively. Primer outcome is the\\n      pain measurements of the patients before and after the procedure at the 1st, 3rd,\\n      and 6th months were evaluated with the Verbal Pain Scale (VPS). Our secondary\\n      outcome was the evaluation of patient satisfaction in the 1st, 3rd, and 6th\\n      months after the interventional treatment, and it was considered significant if\\n      it was evaluated as \\\\\"good\\\\\" above 50%.

Observations:\\n      Two recently published retrospective analyses from Parasuraman and colleagues\\n      used Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data to replicate, in a real-world\\n      population, findings from the prospective, randomized Cytoreductive Therapy in\\n      Polycythemia Vera (CYTO-PV) study. In the CYTO-PV study, hematocrit (Hct) level\\n      and white blood cell (WBC) count were shown to be independently associated with\\n      thrombotic event risk in patients with PV. In the VHA analysis, patients with Hct\\n      levels < 45% were found to have a significantly lower rate of thrombotic events\\n      compared to those with levels >/= 45% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.61; P = .04). For WBC\\n      counts and thrombosis, patients with WBC >/= 8.5 x 10(9)/L were found to have a\\n      higher rate of thrombotic events compared to the reference cohort of WBC < 7 x\\n      10(9)/L (HR, 1.47; P < .01), and the rates were higher for those with WBC >/= 11 \\n      x 10(9)/L (HR 1.87; P < .001). Conclusions: The results from these analyses\\n      suggest the need for managing Hct appropriately to maintain levels < 45% and\\n      offer further support for the consideration of WBC counts in determining risk of \\n      thrombotic events. Studies are needed to clearly establish an optimal WBC count\\n      to inform updates to treatment guidelines.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Frontline Medical Communications Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA.\\nFAU - Tashi, Tsewang\\nAU  - Tashi T\\nAD  - Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah and Salt Lake City Veterans Affairs\\n      Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Review\\nDEP - 20220316\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Fed Pract\\nJT  - Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS\\nJID - 9500574\\nPMC - PMC9346576\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:22\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:22 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.12788/fp.0243 [doi]\\nAID - fp-39-05-s43 [pii]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Fed Pract. 2022 May;39(Suppl 2):S43-S46. doi: 10.12788/fp.0243.

The initiatives that are part of the so-called \"dementia-friendly \\n      approach\" aim not only at promoting well-being and dignity of persons suffering\\n      from AD but also improving the way they are regarded and their inclusion in\\n      society. Unfortunately, scarce research has been conducted to assess whether such\\n      goals can be achieved. In France, the experimental Alzheimer Village in Dax is\\n      designed as a dementia-friendly community. Due to the recent opening (2020) and\\n      the strong local media coverage of this project, a survey has been designed to\\n      determine whether the representations of AD have been impacted by such a project.\\n      Methods: The survey was conducted before and after the opening of the Alzheimer\\n      Village in the city of Dax (hosting the village) and surrounding areas, and in a \\n      control city with similar socio-demographics. The analyses intend to compare\\n      different dimensions of the representations and attitudes toward AD in the\\n      general population. Results: A total of 423 persons living in the Alzheimer\\n      Village city (37.4% were men) and 415 persons living in the control city (40.2%\\n      were men) were interviewed, resulting in 838 complete questionnaires. The main\\n      results report significantly lower rating in the perception of loss of identity\\n      (beta = -0.57, P = .014) and in the feeling of disgust for persons with AD (beta \\n      = -0.61, P = .008) in the city hosting the village after the opening of the\\n      Alzheimer Village. No significant changes were seen in the control city sample.\\n      Discussion: While societal representations of AD are very robust and difficult to\\n      change, this study suggests a modest but significant evolution of representations\\n      of AD in the surrounding areas of the Alzheimer Village. Highlights: The French\\n      Alzheimer Village is one of the very few ones in the world.This is the first\\n      study assessing the impact of an Alzheimer Village on disease\\n      representations.After the opening of the village, attitudes toward Alzheimer\\'s\\n      disease have changed.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

To address this uncertainty,\\n      we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of\\n      combined intervention on cognition in older adults with and without mild\\n      cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: We systematically searched eight databases\\n      for relevant articles published from inception to November 1, 2021. Randomized\\n      controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) were used\\n      to compare the effects of the combined intervention with a single cognitive or\\n      sham intervention on cognition in older adults with and without MCI aged >/= 50\\n      years. We also searched Google Scholar, references of the included articles, and \\n      relevant reviews. Two independent reviewers performed the article screening, data\\n      extraction, and bias assessment. GRADEpro was used to rate the strength of\\n      evidence, and RevMan software was used to perform the meta-analysis. Results:\\n      Seventeen studies were included in the analysis, comprising eight studies of\\n      cognitively healthy older adults and nine studies of older adults with MCI. The\\n      meta-analysis showed that the combined intervention significantly improved most\\n      cognitive functions and depression (SMD = 0.99, 95% CI 0.54-1.43, p < 0.0001) in \\n      older adults compared to the control groups, but the intervention effects varied \\n      by cognition domains. However, there was no statistically significant difference \\n      in the maintenance between the combined and sham interventions (SMD = 1.34, 95%\\n      CI -0.58-3.27, p = 0.17). The subgroup analysis also showed that there was no\\n      statistical difference in the combined intervention to improve global cognition, \\n      memory, attention, and executive function between cognitive healthy older adults \\n      and older adults with MCI. Conclusions: Combined intervention improves cognitive \\n      functions in older adults with and without MCI, especially in global cognition,\\n      memory, and executive function. However, there was no statistical difference in\\n      the efficacy of the combined intervention to improve cognition between cognitive \\n      healthy older adults and older adults with MCI. Moreover, the maintenance of the \\n      combined intervention remains unclear due to the limited follow-up data and high \\n      heterogeneity. In the future, more stringent study designs with more follow-ups\\n      are needed further to explore the effects of combined intervention in older\\n      adults.

Conclusion: For the patients with pulmonary\\n      infection, whether the improvement rate of plasma albumin or the readmission rate\\n      is used as the impact index, the standardized nutrition diagnosis and treatment\\n      pathway in 2020 is more economical than the nonstandardized nutrition diagnosis\\n      and treatment pathway.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Yingyi Chen et al.\\nFAU - Chen, Yingyi\\nAU  - Chen Y\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Nutrition, West China Hospital of Sichuan University,\\n      Chengdu, 610041 Sichuan, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Wenqian\\nAU  - Zhang W\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Nutrition, West China Hospital of Sichuan University,\\n      Chengdu, 610041 Sichuan, China.\\nFAU - You, Qian\\nAU  - You Q\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Nutrition, West China Hospital of Sichuan University,\\n      Chengdu, 610041 Sichuan, China.\\nFAU - Zheng, Jie\\nAU  - Zheng J\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Nutrition, West China Hospital of Sichuan University,\\n      Chengdu, 610041 Sichuan, China.\\nFAU - Hu, Wen\\nAU  - Hu W\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Nutrition, West China Hospital of Sichuan University,\\n      Chengdu, 610041 Sichuan, China.\\nFAU - Rao, Zhiyong\\nAU  - Rao Z\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5648-8725\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Nutrition, West China Hospital of Sichuan University,\\n      Chengdu, 610041 Sichuan, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220726\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Comput Math Methods Med\\nJT  - Computational and mathematical methods in medicine\\nJID - 101277751\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9345712\\nCOIS- The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the\\n      publication of this paper.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:22\\nPHST- 2022/05/23 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/28 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/07/01 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:22 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1155/2022/6706390 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Comput Math Methods Med. 2022 Jul 26;2022:6706390. doi: 10.1155/2022/6706390.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928980\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1748-6718 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1748-670X (Linking)\\nVI  - 2022\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Correlation Analysis of Computed Tomography Features and Pathological Types of\\n      Multifocal Ground-Glass Nodular Lung Adenocarcinoma.\\nPG  - 7267036\\nLID - 10.1155/2022/7267036 [doi]\\nAB  - To investigate the correlation between computed tomography (CT) image\\n      characteristics of multiple lung ground-glass nodules (GGNs) and pathological\\n      classification, the CT image data of multiple lung GGN patients confirmed by\\n      pathology (n = 132) in our hospital were collected. The imaging features of GGNs \\n      were analyzed by qualified physicians, including lesion size (diameter, volume,\\n      and mass), location, CT values (mean and relative CT values), lesion morphology\\n      (round and irregular), marginal structure (pagination and burr), internal\\n      structure (bronchial inflation sign), and adjacent structure (pleural\\n      depression). CT imaging analysis was performed for the subtype of infiltrating\\n      adenocarcinoma (IAC). In CT findings, GGNs were greatly different from\\n      adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), pure GGN adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and\\n      microinvasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) in terms of marginal structure, lesion\\n      morphology, internal structure, adjacent structure, and size (P < 0.05). The mean\\n      and relative CT values of mural adenocarcinoma, acinar adenocarcinoma, and\\n      papillary adenocarcinoma of IAC subtypes were greatly different from those of\\n      AAH/AIS/MIA (P < 0.05). In summary, the CT images of GGNs can be used as the\\n      basis for the differentiation of AAH, AIS, and MIA early noninvasive types and\\n      IAC invasive types, and the CT value of the IAC subtype can be used as the basis \\n      for the classification and differentiation of IAC pathological subtypes.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Jieli Kou et al.\\nFAU - Kou, Jieli\\nAU  - Kou J\\nAD  - Graduate School, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nAD  - Medical Imaging Center, Cangzhou People\\'s Hospital, Cangzhou 061000, China.\\nFAU - Gu, Xiaofei\\nAU  - Gu X\\nAD  - Medical Imaging Center, Cangzhou People\\'s Hospital, Cangzhou 061000, China.\\nFAU - Kang, Liqing\\nAU  - Kang L\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6743-8053\\nAD  - Graduate School, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China.\\nAD  - Department of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cangzhou Central Hospital, Cangzhou\\n      061014, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220726\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Comput Math Methods Med\\nJT  - Computational and mathematical methods in medicine\\nJID - 101277751\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9345702\\nCOIS- The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:22\\nPHST- 2022/06/03 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/24 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/07/01 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:22 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1155/2022/7267036 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Comput Math Methods Med. 2022 Jul 26;2022:7267036. doi: 10.1155/2022/7267036.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928978\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1748-6718 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1748-670X (Linking)\\nVI  - 2022\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Effect of Optimized Emergency Care on Treatment Rate and Prognosis of Elderly\\n      Patients with Acute Stroke in Emergency Department: A Systematic Review and\\n      Meta-Analysis.\\nPG  - 5841978\\nLID - 10.1155/2022/5841978 [doi]\\nAB  - Objective: This research was to detect the treatment rate and prognosis of\\n      elderly patients with acute stroke in emergency department by the optimization of\\n      emergency care applying meta-analysis.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically evaluate the effect of\\n      periodontal treatment on GCF and serum proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6,\\n      TNF-alpha, and IL-8) in patients with CP. Methods: Literature searches were\\n      performed through PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China National Knowledge\\n      Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database. Randomized controlled trials\\n      comparing cytokine levels in periodontal treatment (experimental group) and\\n      control group between 2015 and 2020 were included. Results: There were a total of\\n      13 studies included with 1220 patients. There were 630 cases in the experimental \\n      group and 590 cases in the control group. The meta-analysis showed that IL-6\\n      levels in the GCF (SMD = -2.88, 95% CI (-3.68, -2.09), P < 0.001) and serum (SMD \\n      = -1.27, 95% CI (-1.72, -0.81), P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the\\n      experimental group compared with those before treatment. In addition, IL-8 levels\\n      in the GCF (SMD = -2.08, 95% CI (-3.40, -0.76), P < 0.001) and serum (SMD =\\n      -1.73, 95% CI (-2.76, -0.70), P < 0.001) were decreased after periodontal\\n      treatment, but more than that, a decrease was observed in TNF-alpha levels of GCF\\n      (SMD = -3.98, 95% CI (-5.23, -2.73), P < 0.001) and serum (SMD = -1.80, 95% CI\\n      (-3.16, -0.45), P < 0.001) after treatment.

In addition,\\n      5the sensitivity (83.17%), specificity (95.52%), and accuracy (93.08%) of the\\n      combined detection of the three CT signs (stomach wall motility, perigastric fat \\n      infiltration, and enhancement mode) were substantially improved compared with\\n      those of a single sign (P < 0.05). To sum up, the lymph node recognition\\n      algorithm based on OTSU threshold segmentation had better performance in\\n      detecting gastric lymph nodes than traditional algorithms. The CT image\\n      characteristics of gastric wall motility, perigastric fat infiltration, and\\n      enhancement pattern based on artificial intelligence algorithms were effective\\n      indicators for distinguishing gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Lihua Zhou et al.\\nFAU - Zhou, Lihua\\nAU  - Zhou L\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2991-3092\\nAD  - Department of Radiology, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Wuhan, 430034 Hubei, China.\\nFAU - Hu, Hao\\nAU  - Hu H\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1034-503X\\nAD  - Department of Radiology, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Wuhan, 430034 Hubei, China.\\nFAU - Zhou, Lei\\nAU  - Zhou L\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7614-9843\\nAD  - Department of Radiology, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Wuhan, 430034 Hubei, China.\\nFAU - Zhou, Yi\\nAU  - Zhou Y\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8927-3221\\nAD  - Department of Radiology, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Wuhan, 430034 Hubei, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220726\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Comput Math Methods Med\\nJT  - Computational and mathematical methods in medicine\\nJID - 101277751\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9345719\\nCOIS- The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:22\\nPHST- 2022/04/25 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/09 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/06/11 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:22 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1155/2022/2259373 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Comput Math Methods Med. 2022 Jul 26;2022:2259373. doi: 10.1155/2022/2259373.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928971\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1748-6718 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1748-670X (Linking)\\nVI  - 2022\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Efficacy of Low Molecular Weight Heparin in Preventing Perinatal Venous\\n      Thrombosis: A Meta-Analysis.\\nPG  - 1248577\\nLID - 10.1155/2022/1248577 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: There have been controversies about the preventive effect of low\\n      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on venous thrombosis (VT) in the perinatal\\n      period. This study is aimed at exploring the effectiveness of LMWH in preventing \\n      perinatal VT through meta-analysis. Methods: Databases such as CNKI, China\\n      Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc), Wanfang, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Central\\n      were searched. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) subjects: women at high\\n      risk of perinatal VT; (2) experimental group and control group; (3) intervention \\n      measures: the experimental group was given LMWH, while the control group was\\n      given placebo or standard heparin or physical therapy; (4) outcomes: perinatal VT\\n      events or bleeding events; and (5) randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Jadad\\n      scale was used to evaluate the literature quality. The Mantel-Haenszel method was\\n      used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The\\n      chi-square test was used to analyze the heterogeneity of the included literature.\\n      Subgroup analysis was used to explore the source of heterogeneity. Publication\\n      bias was evaluated via funnel plot and Egger test. Results: The incidence of\\n      perinatal VT in the LMWH group was lower than that in the control group (OR =\\n      0.16, 95% CI (0.08, 0.32), P < 0.00001). There was no heterogeneity among\\n      literatures (P = 0.77, I (2) = 0%) and no publication bias. The incidence of\\n      postpartum VT in the LMWH group was lower than that in the control group (OR =\\n      0.14, 95% CI (0.07, 0.30), P < 0.00001). There was no heterogeneity among\\n      literatures (P = 0.69, I (2) = 0%) and no publication bias. The incidence of\\n      perinatal bleeding in the LMWH group was higher than in the control group (OR =\\n      1.72, 95% CI (1.06, 2.77), P = 0.03). There was no heterogeneity among\\n      literatures (P = 0.25, I (2) = 26%) and no publication bias. Conclusion: LMWH can\\n      reduce the incidence of perinatal VT in high-risk women but increase the risk of \\n      bleeding. The use of LMWH to prevent perinatal VT should be closely monitored.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Yan Huang et al.\\nFAU - Huang, Yan\\nAU  - Huang Y\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics, Hainan Women and Children\\'s Medical Center, Haikou\\n      570216, China.\\nFAU - Li, Fei\\nAU  - Li F\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chengmai County People\\'s Hospital,\\n      Chengmai 571900, China.\\nFAU - Li, Changhong\\nAU  - Li C\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics, Hainan Women and Children\\'s Medical Center, Haikou\\n      570216, China.\\nFAU - Liao, Xueli\\nAU  - Liao X\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2048-9707\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, Hainan Women and Children\\'s Medical Center, Haikou\\n      570216, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220726\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Comput Math Methods Med\\nJT  - Computational and mathematical methods in medicine\\nJID - 101277751\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9345706\\nCOIS- The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:22\\nPHST- 2022/06/13 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/05 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/07/14 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:22 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1155/2022/1248577 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Comput Math Methods Med. 2022 Jul 26;2022:1248577. doi: 10.1155/2022/1248577.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928970\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1748-6718 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1748-670X (Linking)\\nVI  - 2022\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Effects of mir-195 Targeted Regulation of JAK2 on Proliferation, Invasion, and\\n      Apoptosis of Gastric Cancer Cells.\\nPG  - 5873479\\nLID - 10.1155/2022/5873479 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Overexpression of miR-195 can make gastric cancer cells stay in G1/G2\\n      phase. miR-195 has been shown to inhibit gastric cancer cell replication and\\n      accelerate cell death by targeting JAK2. However, the relationship between\\n      miR-195, JAK2, and gastric cancer is not clear. Objective: To observe the effect \\n      of mir-195 regulated by JAK2 on the growth, invasion, and death of gastric cancer\\n      cells. Methods: MGC803 and NCI gastric N87 cells were introduced into the\\n      negative control sequences of miR-195 and RNA, respectively. To detect the\\n      expression of miR-195 in cells, to detect the effect of miR-195 on mitosis and\\n      proliferation of tumor cells, to analyze the effect of miR-195 on cell invasion\\n      and metastasis, and to detect the regulation of miR-195 on JAK2 expression.\\n      Results: The level of miR-195 in miR-195-MIMICS group was significantly higher\\n      than that in miR-NC group. The cell survival rate of miR-195 mimic group was\\n      lower than that of miR-NC group (P < 0.05). Compared with miR-NC group, the\\n      number of cells in G1 phase increased, the cells in G2 phase and S phase\\n      decreased, and the proportion of cells in G2 and S phase decreased in miR-195\\n      mimic group. The scratch distance of miR-195 simulator group was larger than that\\n      of control group. The number of invasive cells in the miR-195 mimic group was\\n      significantly lower than that in the control group. The expression of JAK2\\n      protein in miR-195 mimic group was lower than that in miR-NC group. There was a\\n      significant negative correlation between the expression level of miR-195 and JAK2\\n      (rhabdomile 0.326 and record 0.00).

This article will explore the\\n      clinicopathological and molecular changes and tumor immune activity of the\\n      abnormal SWI/SNF complex subunit PBRM1 in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) and its\\n      significance. Methods: The cBioPortal, LinkedOmics and TISIDB datasets were used \\n      to analyze the abnormality of the PBRM1 gene in GAC and its relationship with\\n      prognosis, related molecular changes and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).\\n      In addition, 198 GAC cases were collected to further study the relationship\\n      between the loss/attenuation of PBRM1 expression and clinicopathology, prognosis,\\n      microsatellite stability, PD-L1 expression and TIL in GAC. DNA whole-exome\\n      sequencing was performed on 7 cases of gastric cancer with loss of PBRM1\\n      expression. Results: The cBioPortal data showed that PBRM1 deletion/mutation\\n      accounted for 7.32% of GAC and was significantly associated with several\\n      molecular changes, such as molecular subtypes of GAC. The LinkedOmics dataset\\n      showed that PBRM1 mutation and its promoter DNA methylation showed lower PBRM1\\n      mRNA expression, and PBRM1 mutation cases showed significantly higher mRNA\\n      expression of PD-L1 (CD274). TISIDB data showed that PBRM1 abnormalities were\\n      significantly positively associated with multiple TILs. In our group of 198\\n      cases, the loss/attenuation of PBRM1 expression was significantly positively\\n      correlated with intra-tumoral tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (iTILs) and\\n      deficient MMR and PD-L1 expression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that\\n      the overall survival of GAC patients with loss/attenuation of PBRM1 expression\\n      was significantly better (p = 0.023). iTIL was an independent prognostic factor\\n      of GAC. Loss of PBRM1 expression often co-occurs with mutations in other SWI/SNF \\n      complex subunit genes, and there are some repetitive KEGG signaling changes.\\n      Conclusion: Abnormality of the PBRM1 gene may be related to the occurrence of\\n      some GACs and can affect tumor immune activity, thereby affecting\\n      clinicopathology and prognosis. It may be a potentially effective predictive\\n      marker for immunotherapy and a novel therapeutic approach associated with\\n      synthetic lethality.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Zhou, Huang, Yang, Liang, Wang and Rao.\\nFAU - Zhou, Zhiyi\\nAU  - Zhou Z\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, The Affiliated Wuxi People\\'s Hospital of Nanjing Medical\\n      University, Wuxi, China.\\nFAU - Huang, Dandan\\nAU  - Huang D\\nAD  - Digestive Endoscopic Center, The Affiliated Wuxi People\\'s Hospital of Nanjing\\n      Medical University, Wuxi, China.\\nFAU - Yang, Shudong\\nAU  - Yang S\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, The Affiliated Wuxi People\\'s Hospital of Nanjing Medical\\n      University, Wuxi, China.\\nFAU - Liang, Jiabei\\nAU  - Liang J\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, The Affiliated Wuxi People\\'s Hospital of Nanjing Medical\\n      University, Wuxi, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Xuan\\nAU  - Wang X\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine,\\n      Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Rao, Qiu\\nAU  - Rao Q\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine,\\n      Nanjing, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Pathol Oncol Res\\nJT  - Pathology oncology research : POR\\nJID - 9706087\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9344308\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - PBRM1\\nOT  - PD-L1\\nOT  - gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC)\\nOT  - microsatellite stability\\nOT  - prognosis\\nOT  - tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:21\\nPHST- 2022/03/31 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/15 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:21 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/pore.2022.1610479 [doi]\\nAID - 1610479 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Pathol Oncol Res. 2022 Jul 19;28:1610479. doi: 10.3389/pore.2022.1610479.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928960\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2296-4185 (Print)\\nIS  - 2296-4185 (Linking)\\nVI  - 10\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Wood-Derived Vascular Patches Loaded With Rapamycin Inhibit Neointimal\\n      Hyperplasia.\\nPG  - 933505\\nLID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.933505 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Patches are commonly used to close blood vessels after vascular\\n      surgery. Most currently used materials are either prosthetics or animal-derived; \\n      although natural materials, such as a leaf, can be used as a patch, healing of\\n      these natural materials is not optimal; rhodamine and rapamycin have been used to\\n      show that coating patches with drugs allow drug delivery to inhibit neointimal\\n      hyperplasia that may improve patch healing. Wood is abundant, and its stiffness\\n      can be reduced with processing; however, whether wood can be used as a vascular\\n      patch is not established. We hypothesized that wood can be used as a vascular\\n      patch and thus may serve as a novel plant-based biocompatible material. Method:\\n      Male Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 6-8 weeks) were used as an inferior vena cava\\n      (IVC) patch venoplasty model. After softening, wood patches coated with rhodamine\\n      and rapamycin were implanted into the rat subcutaneous tissue, the abdominal\\n      cavity, or the IVC. Samples were explanted on day 14 for analysis. Result: Wood\\n      patches became soft after processing. Patches showed biocompatibility after\\n      implantation into the subcutaneous tissue or the abdominal cavity. After\\n      implantation into the IVC, the patches retained mechanical strength. There was a \\n      significantly thinner neointima in wood patches coated with rapamycin than\\n      control patches (146.7 +/- 15.32 mum vs. 524.7 +/- 26.81 mum; p = 0.0001). There \\n      were CD34 and nestin-positive cells throughout the patch, and neointimal\\n      endothelial cells were Eph-B4 and COUP-TFII-positive. There was a significantly\\n      smaller number of PCNA and alpha-actin dual-positive cells in the neointima (p = \\n      0.0003), peri-patch area (p = 0.0198), and adventitia (p = 0.0004) in wood\\n      patches coated with rapamycin than control patches. Piezo1 was expressed in the\\n      neointima and peri-patch area, and there were decreased CD68 and piezo1\\n      dual-positive cells in wood patches coated with rapamycin compared to control\\n      patches. Conclusion: Wood can be used as a novel biomaterial that can be\\n      implanted as a vascular patch and also serve as a scaffold for drug delivery.\\n      Plant-derived materials may be an alternative to prosthetics or animal-based\\n      materials in vascular applications.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Xie, Zhang, Lou, Wei, Li, Bai and Dardik.\\nFAU - Xie, Boao\\nAU  - Xie B\\nAD  - Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of\\n      Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Liwei\\nAU  - Zhang L\\nAD  - Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of\\n      Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.\\nFAU - Lou, Chunyang\\nAU  - Lou C\\nAD  - Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of\\n      Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.\\nFAU - Wei, Shunbo\\nAU  - Wei S\\nAD  - Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of\\n      Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.\\nFAU - Li, Jing\\'an\\nAU  - Li J\\nAD  - School of Material Science and Engineering & Henan Key Laboratory of Advanced\\n      Magnesium Alloy & Key Laboratory of Materials Processing and Mold Technology\\n      (Ministry of Education), Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.\\nFAU - Bai, Hualong\\nAU  - Bai H\\nAD  - Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of\\n      Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.\\nAD  - Key Vascular Physiology and Applied Research Laboratory of Zhengzhou City,\\n      Zhengzhou, China.\\nFAU - Dardik, Alan\\nAU  - Dardik A\\nAD  - The Vascular Biology and Therapeutics Program, Yale University School of\\n      Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.\\nAD  - Department of Surgery and of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Yale University\\n      School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Bioeng Biotechnol\\nJT  - Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology\\nJID - 101632513\\nPMC - PMC9343873\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - neointimal hyperplasia\\nOT  - patch venoplasty\\nOT  - rapamycin\\nOT  - vascular patch\\nOT  - wood\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:21\\nPHST- 2022/05/01 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/22 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:21 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.933505 [doi]\\nAID - 933505 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Bioeng Biotechnol. 2022 Jul 19;10:933505. doi: 10.3389/fbioe.2022.933505.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928938\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2297-055X (Print)\\nIS  - 2297-055X (Linking)\\nVI  - 9\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Development and Validation of a Personalized, Sex-Specific Prediction Algorithm\\n      of Severe Atheromatosis in Middle-Aged Asymptomatic Individuals: The ILERVAS\\n      Study.\\nPG  - 895917\\nLID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.895917 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Although European guidelines recommend vascular ultrasound for the\\n      assessment of cardiovascular risk in low-to-moderate risk individuals, no\\n      algorithm properly identifies patients who could benefit from it.

Models were trained in the ILERVAS cohort (n =\\n      8,330; 51% women) and validated in the control subpopulation of the NEFRONA\\n      cohort (n = 559; 47% women). Performance was compared to the Systematic COronary \\n      Risk Evaluation (SCORE) model. Results: The PASAP-ILERVAS is a sex-specific,\\n      easy-to-interpret predictive model that stratifies individuals according to their\\n      risk of SA in low, intermediate, or high risk. New clinical predictors beyond\\n      traditional factors were uncovered. In low- and high-risk (L&H-risk) men, the net\\n      reclassification index (NRI) was 0.044 (95% CI: 0.020-0.068), and the integrated \\n      discrimination index (IDI) was 0.038 (95% CI: 0.029-0.048) compared to the SCORE.\\n      In L&H-risk women, PASAP-ILERVAS showed a significant increase in the area under \\n      the curve (AUC, 0.074 (95% CI: 0.062-0.087), p-value: < 0.001), an NRI of 0.193\\n      (95% CI: 0.162-0.224), and an IDI of 0.119 (95% CI: 0.109-0.129). Conclusion: The\\n      PASAP-ILERVAS improves SA prediction, especially in women. Thus, it could reduce \\n      the number of unnecessary complementary explorations selecting patients for a\\n      further imaging study within the intermediate risk group, increasing\\n      cost-effectiveness and optimizing health resources.

We explored the differences in the circumferential pulmonary vein\\n      isolation (CPVI), which is the cornerstone procedure for AF catheter ablation,\\n      additional high dominant frequency (DF) site ablation, and antiarrhythmic drug\\n      (AAD) effects according to the patient genotype (wild-type and PITX2 (+/-)\\n      deficient) using computational modeling. Methods: We included 25 patients with AF\\n      (68% men, 59.8 +/- 9.8 years of age, 32% paroxysmal AF) who underwent AF catheter\\n      ablation to develop a realistic computational AF model. The ion currents for\\n      baseline AF and the amiodarone, dronedarone, and flecainide AADs according to the\\n      patient genotype (wild type and PITX2 (+/-) deficient) were defined by relevant\\n      publications. We tested the virtual CPVI (V-CPVI) with and without DF ablation\\n      (+/-DFA) and three virtual AADs (V-AADs, amiodarone, dronedarone, and flecainide)\\n      and evaluated the AF defragmentation rates (AF termination or changes to regular \\n      atrial tachycardia (AT), DF, and maximal slope of the action potential duration\\n      restitution curves (Smax), which indicates the vulnerability of wave-breaks.\\n      Results: At the baseline AF, mean DF (p = 0.003), and Smax (p < 0.001) were\\n      significantly lower in PITX2 (+/-) deficient patients than wild-type patients. In\\n      the overall AF episodes, V-CPVI (+/-DFA) resulted in a higher AF defragmentation \\n      relative to V-AADs (65 vs. 42%, p < 0.001) without changing the DF or Smax.\\n      Although a PITX2 (+/-) deficiency did not affect the AF defragmentation rate\\n      after the V-CPVI (+/-DFA), V-AADs had a higher AF defragmentation rate (p =\\n      0.014), lower DF (p < 0.001), and lower Smax (p = 0.001) in PITX2 (+/-) deficient\\n      AF than in wild-type patients. In the clinical setting, the PITX2 (+/-) genetic\\n      risk score did not affect the AF ablation rhythm outcome (Log-rank p = 0.273).\\n      Conclusion: Consistent with previous clinical studies, the V-CPVI had effective\\n      anti-AF effects regardless of the PITX2 genotype, whereas V-AADs exhibited more\\n      significant defragmentation or wave-dynamic change in the PITX2 (+/-) deficient\\n      patients.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Jin, Hwang, Lim, Kwon, Park, Yu, Kim, Joung, Lee and Pak.\\nFAU - Jin, Ze\\nAU  - Jin Z\\nAD  - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul,\\n      South Korea.\\nFAU - Hwang, Inseok\\nAU  - Hwang I\\nAD  - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul,\\n      South Korea.\\nFAU - Lim, Byounghyun\\nAU  - Lim B\\nAD  - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul,\\n      South Korea.\\nFAU - Kwon, Oh-Seok\\nAU  - Kwon OS\\nAD  - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul,\\n      South Korea.\\nFAU - Park, Je-Wook\\nAU  - Park JW\\nAD  - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul,\\n      South Korea.\\nFAU - Yu, Hee-Tae\\nAU  - Yu HT\\nAD  - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul,\\n      South Korea.\\nFAU - Kim, Tae-Hoon\\nAU  - Kim TH\\nAD  - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul,\\n      South Korea.\\nFAU - Joung, Boyoung\\nAU  - Joung B\\nAD  - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul,\\n      South Korea.\\nFAU - Lee, Moon-Hyoung\\nAU  - Lee MH\\nAD  - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul,\\n      South Korea.\\nFAU - Pak, Hui-Nam\\nAU  - Pak HN\\nAD  - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul,\\n      South Korea.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Cardiovasc Med\\nJT  - Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine\\nJID - 101653388\\nPMC - PMC9343754\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - PITX2\\nOT  - antiarrhythmic drug\\nOT  - atrial fibrillation\\nOT  - computational modeling\\nOT  - dominant frequency\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:21\\nPHST- 2022/05/13 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/23 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:21 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.942998 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Cardiovasc Med. 2022 Jul 19;9:942998. doi: 10.3389/fcvm.2022.942998.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928933\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2297-055X (Print)\\nIS  - 2297-055X (Linking)\\nVI  - 9\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Understanding Study Drug Discontinuation Through EUCLID.\\nPG  - 947645\\nLID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.947645 [doi]\\nAB  - Introduction: Disparities in the care and outcomes of peripheral artery disease\\n      (PAD) have been well-established. In part this is due to disparities in\\n      enrollment of PAD trial cohorts. However, less attention has been paid to\\n      non-random protocol non-adherence after enrollment, which may lead to inaccurate \\n      estimates of treatment effects and reduce generalizability of study results. We\\n      aimed to ascertain characteristics associated with premature study drug\\n      discontinuation in a PAD cohort. Methods: Using data from EUCLID (Examining Use\\n      of Ticagrelor in Peripheral Artery Disease), factors associated with study drug\\n      discontinuation were assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox\\n      proportional hazards models with time to study drug discontinuation as the\\n      outcome of interest. Relationships between study drug discontinuation and major\\n      adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction,\\n      ischemic stroke), major adverse limb events (MALE; acute limb ischemia, major\\n      amputation, and lower extremity revascularization), and all-cause hospitalization\\n      were assessed. Results: Of 13,842 eligible EUCLID participants, 3,886 (28.1%)\\n      prematurely and permanently discontinued study drug over a maximum follow-up of\\n      42 months (annualized rate of 13.2 discontinuations per 100 patient-years). In a \\n      multivariable model, premature study drug discontinuation was associated with\\n      older age (aHR 1.16, 95%CI 1.14-1.19), eligibility based on prior lower extremity\\n      revascularization rather than ABI/TBI criteria (aHR 1.14, 95%CI 1.06-1.23), CLI\\n      status (aHR 1.23, 95%CI 1.06-1.42), COPD (aHR 1.36, 95%CI 1.24-1.49), and\\n      geographic region. In a multivariable analysis, study drug discontinuation was\\n      significantly associated with MACE (aHR 3.27, 95%CI 2.90-3.67, p < 0.001), MALE\\n      (aHR 1.84, 95%CI 1.63-2.07, p < 0.001), and all-cause hospitalization (aHR 2.37, \\n      95%CI 2.21-2.54) following study drug discontinuation. Conclusions: This analysis\\n      of EUCLID demonstrates that premature, permanent discontinuation of study drug is\\n      relatively common in more than a quarter of PAD patients, is unevenly distributed\\n      based on geography and other baseline characteristics, and is associated with\\n      worse outcomes in a clinical trial context. Study teams leading future PAD trials\\n      may want to address the possibility of study drug discontinuation prospectively, \\n      as a proactive approach may help investigators to maintain study cohort diversity\\n      and representativeness without sacrificing power and precision.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Weissler, Mulder, Rockhold, Baumgartner, Norgren, Blomster,\\n      Katona, Fowkes, Mahaffey, Bonaca, Patel and Jones.\\nFAU - Weissler, E Hope\\nAU  - Weissler EH\\nAD  - School of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States.\\nFAU - Mulder, Hillary\\nAU  - Mulder H\\nAD  - School of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States.\\nFAU - Rockhold, Frank W\\nAU  - Rockhold FW\\nAD  - School of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States.\\nFAU - Baumgartner, Iris\\nAU  - Baumgartner I\\nAD  - Department of Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.\\nFAU - Norgren, Lars\\nAU  - Norgren L\\nAD  - Faculty of Medicine and Health, Orebro University, Orebro, Sweden.\\nFAU - Blomster, Juuso\\nAU  - Blomster J\\nAD  - Faculty of Medicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.\\nFAU - Katona, Brian G\\nAU  - Katona BG\\nAD  - AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE, United States.\\nFAU - Fowkes, F Gerry R\\nAU  - Fowkes FGR\\nAD  - Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute, Edinburgh Medical School,\\n      University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.\\nFAU - Mahaffey, Kenneth\\nAU  - Mahaffey K\\nAD  - School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.\\nFAU - Bonaca, Marc\\nAU  - Bonaca M\\nAD  - Colorado Prevention Center, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz\\n      Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States.\\nFAU - Patel, Manesh R\\nAU  - Patel MR\\nAD  - School of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States.\\nFAU - Jones, W Schuyler\\nAU  - Jones WS\\nAD  - School of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220715\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Cardiovasc Med\\nJT  - Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine\\nJID - 101653388\\nPMC - PMC9344128\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - antiplatelet therapy)\\nOT  - clinical trial\\nOT  - disparities (health\\nOT  - peripheral artery disease (PAD)\\nOT  - protocol deviation\\nCOIS- EUCLID was funded by AstraZeneca; AstraZeneca did not fund the analysis in this\\n      manuscript, design the analysis, or draft the manuscript, but did approve the\\n      manuscript.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 45 consecutive patients with VSR\\n      after AMI whose procedures were performed in the Department of Cardiovascular\\n      Surgery at the General Hospital of Northern Theater Command between January 2012 \\n      and December 2021. Relevant clinical data, surgery-related conditions, and\\n      follow-up data of all patients were summarized. Patients were divided into the\\n      survival group and the death group. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test\\n      were used to determine the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality.\\n      Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent risk\\n      factors for all-cause mortality. Results: The average postoperative follow-up\\n      time was 42.1 +/- 34.1 months. The overall mortality rate was 20% (9/45 patients)\\n      and the operative mortality rate was 8.9% (4/45 patients). Logistic analysis\\n      showed that the death group had higher serum creatinine (127.32 +/- 47.82 vs.\\n      82.61 +/- 27.80 mumol/L, respectively; P = 0.0238) and N-terminal pro-B-type\\n      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) [8,654.00 pg/mL (6,197.00-11,949.00 pg/mL) vs.\\n      4,268.96 pg/mL (1,800.00-7,894.00 pg/mL), respectively; P = 0.0134] levels than\\n      the survival group. The cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB) was longer in the death\\n      group than in the survival group [131.00 min (121.00-184.00 min) vs. 119.00 min\\n      (103.00-151.50 min), respectively; P = 0.0454]. Significantly more red blood\\n      cells were transfused in the death group than in the survival group [11.60 units \\n      (6.10-16.50) vs. 3.75 units (0.00-7.00 units), respectively; P = 0.0025].\\n      Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) implantation (P = 0.016) and ventilation time (P\\n      = 0.0022) were risk factors for mortality. A 1-month landmark analysis showed\\n      that compared with patients with VSR to surgical time >14 days, patients who\\n      underwent surgery within 14 days had a higher rate of all-cause mortality (25.00 \\n      vs. 3.33%; log-rank P = 0.023). Patients with VSR within 14 days also had a\\n      higher rate of residual shunts that were higher than moderate. Multivariate\\n      analysis showed that transfusion of red blood cells and NT-proBNP level were risk\\n      factors for all-cause mortality, as well as major adverse cardiovascular and\\n      cerebrovascular events. Conclusions: Surgical repair resulted in good outcomes\\n      for patients with VSR after AMI. Patients with VSR to surgical time >14 days had \\n      a lower rate of all-cause mortality.

Methods: \\n      From March 2020 to March 2021, 43 hospitalized children with epilepsy admitted to\\n      the Department of Neurology of the hospital were included, and another 43 gender-\\n      and age-matched healthy children were randomly selected as the healthy control\\n      group during the same period. Then fasting serum samples of the two groups were\\n      collected to extract the exosomes. The morphology of the exosomes was evaluated\\n      under a transmission electron microscope, and the expression of specific protein \\n      markers on the surface was detected by Western Blot. In addition, the relative\\n      expression of miR-155 in serum exosomes in children with epilepsy with different \\n      courses of the disease and different degrees of abnormal electroencephalography\\n      (EEG) was compared, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic\\n      (ROC) curve (ROC-AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of miR-155.\\n      Results: A higher relative expression level of miR-155 in serum exosomes was\\n      obtained in the epilepsy group, as compared to the healthy control group\\n      (P<0.05), and the relative expression of miR-155 in serum exosomes in children\\n      with epilepsy was correlated with the course of the disease and the degree of\\n      abnormal EEG (both P<0.05). In addition, the expression of miR-155 in serum\\n      exosomes showed high diagnostic efficiency for epilepsy (AUC = 0.813, P<0.05).\\n      Conclusion: The expression of miR-155 in serum exosomes in children with epilepsy\\n      is up-regulated, and its level is related to the course of the disease and the\\n      degree of abnormal EEG, so miR-155 in serum exosomes may be used as a biomarker\\n      for the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of epilepsy.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Ya Liu et al.\\nFAU - Liu, Ya\\nAU  - Liu Y\\nAD  - Pediatric Department of Liaocheng Second People\\'s Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong\\n      Province, China.\\nFAU - Yu, Gang\\nAU  - Yu G\\nAD  - Maternity & Child Care Center of Dezhou, Dezhou, Shandong Province, China.\\nFAU - Ding, Yan-Yan\\nAU  - Ding YY\\nAD  - Maternity & Child Care Center of Dezhou, Dezhou, Shandong Province, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Yong-Xia\\nAU  - Zhang YX\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4801-7517\\nAD  - Department of Paediatric Rehabilitation, Linyi People\\'s Hospital, Linyi, Shandong\\n      Province, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220726\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Dis Markers\\nJT  - Disease markers\\nJID - 8604127\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9345723\\nCOIS- The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:21\\nPHST- 2021/12/30 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/02/22 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:21 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1155/2022/7979500 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Dis Markers. 2022 Jul 26;2022:7979500. doi: 10.1155/2022/7979500. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928924\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1875-8630 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 0278-0240 (Linking)\\nVI  - 2022\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - BNP on Admission Combined with Imaging Markers of Multimodal CT to Predict the\\n      Risk of Cardioembolic Stroke.\\nPG  - 3327967\\nLID - 10.1155/2022/3327967 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: The aim of the study was to find the potential roles of B-type\\n      natriuretic peptide (BNP) and imaging markers on distinguishing cardioembolic\\n      (CE) stroke from non-CE stroke, so as to provide useful information for making\\n      individualized endovascular treatment (EVT) plan for the patients with acute\\n      ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: The patients with unilateral anterior circulation\\n      large vessel occlusion who underwent EVT between March 2016 and December 2021\\n      were analyzed in this study, retrospectively. The risk factors, laboratory test\\n      indicators, imaging parameters, and other factors were compared between the CE\\n      group and non-CE group. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors \\n      of CE stroke. ROC curves were used to assess the values of different parameters\\n      on distinguishing CE stroke from non-CE stroke. The relationships between BNP and\\n      imaging parameters were assessed using the Spearman correlation analysis.\\n      Results: 160 patients were enrolled in the study and divided into the CE group (n\\n      = 66) and non-CE group (n = 94). BNP (odds ratio (OR) = 1.004; 95% CI,\\n      1.001-1.009; p = 0.038), MMR (OR = 0.736; 95% CI, 0.573-0.945; p = 0.016), NIHSS \\n      (OR = 1.150; 95% CI, 1.022-1.294; p = 0.020), and AF (OR = 556.968; 95% CI,\\n      51.739-5995.765; p < 0.001) were the independent predictive factors of CE stroke.\\n      The area under the curve (AUC) of BNP and mismatch ratio (MMR) were 0.846 (95% CI\\n      (0.780-0.898), p < 0.001) and 0.636 (95% CI (0.633-0.779), p < 0.001),\\n      respectively. The cut-off value of BNP was 249.23 pg/mL with the sensitivity of\\n      74.24% and the specificity of 82.98%. BNP combined with MMR improved the\\n      predictive value for CE stroke. The AUC of the combination was 0.858 with the\\n      sensitivity of 84.85% and the specificity of 73.40%. BNP was correlated with 4D\\n      CTA collateral score, MMR, clot burden score, final infarct volume, infarct core \\n      volume, and ischemic penumbra volume (all, p < 0.05). Conclusion: BNP on\\n      admission combined with MMR is valuable for the risk prediction of CE stroke,\\n      which will promote the further screening of the high-risk patients with CE stroke\\n      and provide more diagnostic information for clinicians.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Ruoyao Cao et al.\\nFAU - Cao, Ruoyao\\nAU  - Cao R\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3405-021X\\nAD  - Department of Radiology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology,\\n      Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China.\\nAD  - Graduate School of Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Jiang, Yun\\nAU  - Jiang Y\\nAD  - Department of Neurology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology,\\n      Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China.\\nFAU - Li, Ling\\nAU  - Li L\\nAD  - Department of Radiology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology,\\n      Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China.\\nFAU - Lu, Yao\\nAU  - Lu Y\\nAD  - Department of Radiology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology,\\n      Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Junjie\\nAU  - Wang J\\nAD  - Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology,\\n      Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China.\\nFAU - Yu, Kezhen\\nAU  - Yu K\\nAD  - Department of Radiology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology,\\n      Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Min\\nAU  - Chen M\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7777-7908\\nAD  - Department of Radiology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology,\\n      Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China.\\nAD  - Graduate School of Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Juan\\nAU  - Chen J\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5261-830X\\nAD  - Department of Radiology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology,\\n      Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220726\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Dis Markers\\nJT  - Disease markers\\nJID - 8604127\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9345733\\nCOIS- The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:21\\nPHST- 2022/04/25 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/05/22 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/06/22 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:21 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1155/2022/3327967 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Dis Markers. 2022 Jul 26;2022:3327967. doi: 10.1155/2022/3327967. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928922\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2352-0779 (Print)\\nIS  - 2352-0779 (Linking)\\nVI  - 9\\nIP  - 1\\nDP  - 2022 Jan\\nTI  - Chemotherapy Utilization in Men with Advanced Penile Cancer.\\nPG  - 12-15\\nLID - 10.1097/UPJ.0000000000000270 [doi]\\nAB  - Introduction: Although studies using mixed insurance populations suggest that\\n      chemotherapy use in men with advanced penile cancer (PC) is low, it is unclear\\n      what regimens are being utilized. In this study, we use a database of insured\\n      patients to better understand specific chemotherapy utilization in men with PC.\\n      Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with stage IIIB or IV\\n      PC in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database\\n      (2004-2015). Standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy was defined by the National\\n      Comprehensive Cancer Network(R) guidelines: 4 cycles of paclitaxel, ifosfamide\\n      and cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil with cisplatin in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or\\n      primary setting. We calculated what proportion of patients receive SOC or any\\n      chemotherapy within 2 years of diagnosis and analyzed what factors were\\n      associated with receiving chemotherapy. Results: Our study included 147\\n      patients-48 stage IIIB and 99 stage IV. Of these patients, 49 (33%) received\\n      chemotherapy. Less than 5% of men received SOC. About 10% received SOC\\n      chemotherapy but an insufficient number of cycles. Married men were more likely\\n      to undergo chemotherapy (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5-7.8). Less than 5% of the 24 Black or\\n      Hispanic patients received chemotherapy compared to 37% of white patients (p\\n      <0.001). Conclusions: Only a third of men with stage IIIB/IV PC underwent\\n      chemotherapy. Less than 5% of men received complete guideline-based regimens.\\n      Whether this is driven primarily by patient or provider factors is unknown,\\n      although social determinants of health may play a role. These data highlight the \\n      difficulty for patients with PC to get chemotherapy.\\nCI  - (c) 2021 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.\\nFAU - Chang, Edward\\nAU  - Chang E\\nAD  - Department of Urology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle,\\n      Washington.\\nFAU - Holt, Sarah\\nAU  - Holt S\\nAD  - Department of Urology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle,\\n      Washington.\\nFAU - Montgomery, Bruce\\nAU  - Montgomery B\\nAD  - Division of Medical Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine,\\n      Seattle, Washington.\\nFAU - Wright, Jonathan\\nAU  - Wright J\\nAD  - Department of Urology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle,\\n      Washington.\\nAD  - Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Center Research Center,\\n      Seattle, Washington.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20211015\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Urol Pract\\nJT  - Urology practice\\nJID - 101635343\\nPMC - PMC9275856\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - drug therapy\\nOT  - neoplasm metastasis\\nOT  - penile neoplasms\\nOT  - standard of care\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:21\\nPHST- 2021/07/06 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2021/08/09 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:21 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1097/UPJ.0000000000000270 [doi]\\nAID - UP-21-129 [pii]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Urol Pract. 2022 Jan;9(1):12-15. doi: 10.1097/UPJ.0000000000000270.

This study investigated the\\n      effect of dapagliflozin on Cx43 and Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in ventricular\\n      myocytes. Methods: A rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus was established by\\n      high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin, and the animals were treated randomly\\n      with dapagliflozin. The morphological changes of the myocardium were observed by \\n      hematoxylin eosin staining, and the expression and distribution of Cx43 in\\n      ventricular myocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry. And Western blot\\n      determined the expressions of Cx43, Akt, mTOR, p62, and LC3 proteins in rat\\n      myocardium. Results: Compared with the normal control group, the heart rate of\\n      diabetic rats decreased significantly (p < 0.05), QRS wave of ECG widened, and QT\\n      interval prolonged (p < 0.05). Dapagliflozin treatment in diabetic rats resulted \\n      in improvements in these ECG indexes (p < 0.05) with early administration group\\n      obtaining greater efficacy than the late administration group (p < 0.05). In the \\n      normal control group, the cardiomyocytes were arranged orderly, and the\\n      expression of Cx43 was dense, uniform, and regular, which was higher than that in\\n      the intercalated disc. In the diabetic control model group, the cardiomyocytes\\n      were enlarged and presented disorderly with detection of Cx43 in the cytoplasm.\\n      Early use of dapagliflozin better improved these myocardial tissue lesions. Of\\n      note, as diabetic rats exhibited decreased expression of Cx43, Akt, and mTOR (p <\\n      0.05), increased p62 expression (p < 0.05), and decreased LC3-II/I ratio (p <\\n      0.05), administration of dapagliflozin partially reversed the expression of the\\n      above proteins (p < 0.05) with greater improvement in the early administration\\n      group compared with the late administration group (p < 0.05). Conclusions:\\n      Dapagliflozin increases the expression of Cx43 in cardiomyocytes of diabetic rats\\n      and thereby alleviates heart failure partly through regulating the Akt/mTOR\\n      signaling pathway.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Mengxiang Ren et al.\\nFAU - Ren, Mengxiang\\nAU  - Ren M\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Yijishan Hospital, Wannan Medical College, Anhui\\n      Province, China 241001.\\nFAU - Pan, Dabin\\nAU  - Pan D\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7787-7175\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Yijishan Hospital, Wannan Medical College, Anhui\\n      Province, China 241001.\\nFAU - Zha, Dayong\\nAU  - Zha D\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Wuhu Second People\\'s Hospital, Anhui Province, China\\n      241001.\\nFAU - Shan, Zeyang\\nAU  - Shan Z\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Bengbu Second People\\'s Hospital, Anhui Province, China \\n      233000.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220726\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Biomed Res Int\\nJT  - BioMed research international\\nJID - 101600173\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9345717\\nCOIS- The authors have no relevant financial or nonfinancial interests to disclose.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/04/20 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/22 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/06/27 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1155/2022/9687345 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Biomed Res Int. 2022 Jul 26;2022:9687345. doi: 10.1155/2022/9687345. eCollection \\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928914\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2314-6141 (Electronic)\\nVI  - 2022\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Duration of Acute Kidney Injury and In-Hospital Mortality in Elder Patients with \\n      Severe COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study.\\nPG  - 9929038\\nLID - 10.1155/2022/9929038 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who develop \\n      acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) have extremely high\\n      rates of mortality. This study evaluated the prognostic impact of AKI duration on\\n      in-hospital mortality in elder patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective\\n      study of 126 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with severe or critical disease who\\n      treated in the ICU from February 4, 2020, to April 16, 2020. AKI was defined\\n      according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes serum creatinine (Scr) \\n      criteria. AKI patients were divided into transient AKI and persistent AKI groups \\n      based on whether Scr level returned to baseline within 48 h post-AKI. Results: In\\n      total, 107 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 70\\n      (64-78) years, and 69 (64.5%) patients were men. AKI occurred in 48 (44.9%)\\n      during their ICU stay. Of these, 11 (22.9%) had transient AKI, and 37 (77.9%) had\\n      persistent AKI. In-hospital mortality was 18.6% (n = 11) for patients without\\n      AKI, 72.7% (n = 8) for patients with transient AKI, and 86.5% (n = 32) for\\n      patients with persistent AKI (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed\\n      that patients with both transient AKI and persistent AKI had significantly higher\\n      death rates than those without AKI (log-rank P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox\\n      regression analysis revealed that transient and persistent AKI were an important \\n      risk factor for in-hospital mortality in older patients with severe COVID-19 even\\n      after adjustment for variables (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.582; 95% CI: 1.025-6.505; P\\n      = 0.044; and HR = 6.974; 95% CI: 3.334-14.588; P < 0.001). Conclusions: AKI\\n      duration can be an important predictive parameter in elder patients suffering\\n      from COVID-19 and are admitted to ICU. Among these patients, those exhibiting\\n      persistent AKI have a lower in-hospital survival rate than those with transient\\n      AKI, emphasizing the importance of identifying an appropriate treatment window\\n      for early intervention.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Yue Cai et al.\\nFAU - Cai, Yue\\nAU  - Cai Y\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3335-0192\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Changle West Road, Xi\\'an 710032,\\n      China.\\nAD  - Huo Shen Shan Hospital, Wuhan, China.\\nFAU - Tang, Chong\\nAU  - Tang C\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Changle West Road, Xi\\'an 710032,\\n      China.\\nFAU - Song, Yun\\nAU  - Song Y\\nAD  - Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Changle West Road, Xi\\'an\\n      710032, China.\\nFAU - Li, Qinglin\\nAU  - Li Q\\nAD  - Department of Critical Care Medicine, The First Medical Centre, Chinese PLA\\n      General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing 100853, China.\\nFAU - Guo, Shanshan\\nAU  - Guo S\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Changle West Road, Xi\\'an 710032,\\n      China.\\nFAU - Chen, Yanyan\\nAU  - Chen Y\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Changle West Road, Xi\\'an 710032,\\n      China.\\nFAU - Wang, Fang\\nAU  - Wang F\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Changle West Road, Xi\\'an 710032,\\n      China.\\nFAU - Li, Yangping\\nAU  - Li Y\\nAD  - Huo Shen Shan Hospital, Wuhan, China.\\nAD  - Department of Nephrology, Xijing Hospital, Changle West Road, Xi\\'an, 710032,\\n      China.\\nFAU - Lei, Yan\\nAU  - Lei Y\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2607-2462\\nAD  - Huo Shen Shan Hospital, Wuhan, China.\\nAD  - Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Changle West Road, Xi\\'an\\n      710032, China.\\nFAU - Li, Fei\\nAU  - Li F\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1081-7105\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Changle West Road, Xi\\'an 710032,\\n      China.\\nAD  - Huo Shen Shan Hospital, Wuhan, China.\\nFAU - Tao, Ling\\nAU  - Tao L\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7076-1185\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Changle West Road, Xi\\'an 710032,\\n      China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220726\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Biomed Res Int\\nJT  - BioMed research international\\nJID - 101600173\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9345708\\nCOIS- The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/01/17 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/05/02 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/05/31 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1155/2022/9929038 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Biomed Res Int. 2022 Jul 26;2022:9929038. doi: 10.1155/2022/9929038. eCollection \\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928912\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2314-6141 (Electronic)\\nVI  - 2022\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Effect of Recombinant Netrin-1 Protein Combined with Peripheral Blood Mesenchymal\\n      Stem Cells on Angiogenesis in Rats with Arteriosclerosis Obliterans.\\nPG  - 3361605\\nLID - 10.1155/2022/3361605 [doi]\\nAB  - This work was aimed to explore the effect of recombinant netrin-1 protein and\\n      peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the angiogenesis ability of\\n      atherosclerosis. 28 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were taken as research models. The\\n      arterial occlusion models were created by surgery and then divided into the\\n      saline control group (n =7), netrin-1 treatment group (n =7), MSCs treatment\\n      group (n =7), and netrin-1 + MSCs combined treatment group (n =7). The peripheral\\n      blood MSCs were extracted from the peritoneal cavity of diseased SD rats and\\n      cultured alone or in combination with netrin-1. The individually cultured MSCs\\n      and netrin-1 were locally injected into the ischemic tissues of SD rats. The\\n      Tarlov scoring was performed at the first, second, and third week of treatment,\\n      respectively. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was\\n      also measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and \\n      the capillary density was measured by immunofluorescence staining. The mean\\n      maximum contractility of the gastrocnemius muscle in each group was determined in\\n      the third week after treatment. The Tarlov score of the netrin-1 + MSCs group was\\n      significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05) at the second\\n      week. To the 4th week of treatment, the Tarlov score of the netrin-1 + MSCs group\\n      was highly increased compared to the netrin-1 group and the MSCs group (P <\\n      0.05). The expression of VEGF in the treatment groups was greatly increased each \\n      week compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the netrin-1 and the\\n      MSCs groups, the VEGF was also notably increased in the netrin-1 + MSCs group (P \\n      <0.05). The capillary densities of the treatment groups were observably greater\\n      than that of the control group in the second and third weeks (P <0.05), while the\\n      capillary density in the netrin-1 + MSCs group was also significantly increased\\n      than those in the netrin-1 group and the MSCs group (P < 0.05). The mean maximum \\n      contractility of the netrin-1 + MSCs group was remarkably higher than that of the\\n      other groups (P < 0.05). The netrin-1 + MSCs group achieved the higher Tarlov\\n      score, higher VEGF expression, higher capillary density, and better muscle\\n      recovery than netrin-1 and MSCs treatments.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Jie Zeng et al.\\nFAU - Zeng, Jie\\nAU  - Zeng J\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan\\n      Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Chengdu, 610072 Sichuan, China.\\nFAU - Lu, Cong\\nAU  - Lu C\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan\\n      Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Chengdu, 610072 Sichuan, China.\\nFAU - Huang, Hui\\nAU  - Huang H\\nAD  - Department of Cardiology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan\\n      Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Chengdu, 610072 Sichuan, China.\\nFAU - Huang, Jianxin\\nAU  - Huang J\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0919-7148\\nAD  - Department of Anesthesiology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan\\n      Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Chengdu, 610072 Sichuan, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220726\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Biomed Res Int\\nJT  - BioMed research international\\nJID - 101600173\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9345694\\nCOIS- The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/06/08 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/30 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/07/02 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1155/2022/3361605 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Biomed Res Int. 2022 Jul 26;2022:3361605. doi: 10.1155/2022/3361605. eCollection \\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928909\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2345-4644 (Print)\\nIS  - 2345-461X (Linking)\\nVI  - 10\\nIP  - 6\\nDP  - 2022 Jun\\nTI  - Implant Removal Due to Infection After Open Reduction and Internal Fixation:\\n      Trends and Predictors.\\nPG  - 514-524\\nLID - 10.22038/ABJS.2021.53838.2688 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Implant removal due to infection is one of the major causes failure\\n      following open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The aim of this study was \\n      to determine trends and predictors of infection-related implant removal following\\n      ORIF of extremities using a nationally representative database. Methods:\\n      Nationwide Inpatient Sample data from 2006 to 2017 was used to identify cases of \\n      ORIF following upper and lower extremity fractures, as well as cases that\\n      underwent infection-related implant removal following ORIF. Multivariate analysis\\n      was performed to identify independent predictors of infection-related implant\\n      removal, controlling for patient demographics and comorbidities, hospital\\n      characteristics, site of fracture, and year. Results: For all ORIF procedures,\\n      the highest rate of implant removal due to infection was the phalanges/hand\\n      (5.61%), phalanges/foot (5.08%), and the radius/ulna (4.85%). Implant removal\\n      rates due to infection decreased in all fractures except radial/ulnar fractures. \\n      Tarsal/metatarsal fractures (odds ratio (OR)=1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): \\n      1.02-2.05), and tibial fractures (OR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.45-2.28) were identified as \\n      independent predictors of infection-related implant removal. Male gender\\n      (OR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.49-1.87), Obesity (OR=1.85, 95% CI: 1.34-2.54), diabetes\\n      mellitus with chronic complications (OR=1.69, 95% CI: 1.13-2.54, P<0.05),\\n      deficiency anemia (OR=1.59, 95% CI: 1.14-2.22) were patient factors that were\\n      associated with increased infection-related removals. Removal of implant due to\\n      infection had a higher total charge associated with the episode of care (mean:\\n      $166,041) than non-infection related implant removal (mean: $133,110).\\n      Conclusion: Implant removal rates due to infection decreased in all fractures\\n      except radial/ulnar fractures. Diabetes, liver disease, and rheumatoid arthritis \\n      were important predictors of infection-related implant removal.

This study aims to investigate whether\\n      apolipoprotein (apo) mediated differential regulation of lipid metabolism\\n      contributes to the phenotypes of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) and\\n      neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). This study involved 148\\n      subjects including 53 patients with PCV, 44 patients with nAMD, and 51 age-,\\n      sex-matched subjects with normal fundus controls. Routine blood biochemistry\\n      profile was evaluated. Apolipoproteins was estimated by Luminex technology. After\\n      controlling for age, gender, body mass index, duration of hypertension and type 2\\n      diabetes mellitus, apoB/non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)\\n      (p=0.015) was an independent risk factor for nAMD, apoB was an independent risk\\n      factor for PCV(p=0.011), compared with control. Low-density lipoprotein\\n      cholesterol (LDL-C) was significantly higher in patients with PCV when compared\\n      with nAMD (p=0.037). Furthermore, apoB/non-HDL, LDL-C, triglycerides and were\\n      significantly correlated with the pathogenesis of subgroups of PCV and nAMD. We\\n      concluded that lipid profiles and apos are differential regulated in PCV, nAMD\\n      and their subtypes, indicating different pathogenicity contributed to the\\n      different phenotypes of PCV and nAMD. Non-pachy PCV shares pathological\\n      similarities with nAMD, which is highly correlated with age-related\\n      atherosclerosis.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Zhang, Qiu, Gong, Chen, Wang and Nie.\\nFAU - Zhang, Xinyuan\\nAU  - Zhang X\\nAD  - Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University,\\n      Beijing, China.\\nAD  - Beijing Retinal and Choroidal Vascular Disorders Study Group, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Qiu, Bingjie\\nAU  - Qiu B\\nAD  - Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University,\\n      Beijing, China.\\nAD  - Beijing Retinal and Choroidal Vascular Disorders Study Group, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Gong, Zhizhong\\nAU  - Gong Z\\nAD  - Division of Medical Affairs, Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine,\\n      Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Xiaosi\\nAU  - Chen X\\nAD  - Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University,\\n      Beijing, China.\\nAD  - Beijing Retinal and Choroidal Vascular Disorders Study Group, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Yanhong\\nAU  - Wang Y\\nAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences\\n      Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & School of Basic Medicine Peking Union\\n      Medical College, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Nie, Yao\\nAU  - Nie Y\\nAD  - Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University,\\n      Beijing, China.\\nAD  - Beijing Retinal and Choroidal Vascular Disorders Study Group, Beijing, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)\\nJT  - Frontiers in endocrinology\\nJID - 101555782\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9343613\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - apolipoproteins\\nOT  - neovascular age-related macular degeneration\\nOT  - polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy\\nOT  - regulatory mechanisms\\nOT  - serum lipid profiles\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/05/17 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/03 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.946327 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2022 Jul 19;13:946327. doi:\\n      10.3389/fendo.2022.946327. eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928897\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1664-2392 (Print)\\nIS  - 1664-2392 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Short-time intensive insulin therapy upregulates 3 beta- and 17\\n      beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase levels in men with newly diagnosed T2DM.\\nPG  - 894743\\nLID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.894743 [doi]\\nAB  - Objective: Our previous study has found that short-term intensive insulin therapy\\n      in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased serum \\n      testosterone levels, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Design and\\n      methods: In this self-controlled study, 43 men with newly diagnosed drug naive\\n      T2DM, aged 18-60 years, with HbA1c >9.0% were treated with continuous\\n      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) to normalize blood glucose within one week. \\n      Venous blood specimens were collected for measuring of serum total testosterone, \\n      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), 3beta- and 17beta-hydroxysteroid\\n      dehydrogenase (3beta- and 17beta-HSD) concentrations before and after insulin\\n      therapy. Results: Testosterone increased from 13.0 (11.3, 14.6) nmol/L to 15.7\\n      (13.9, 17.5) nmol/L after intensive insulin therapy (p<0.001), while the levels\\n      of DHEA-S decreased significantly after treatment (from 6.5 (5.7, 7.3) mumol/L to\\n      6.0 (5.3, 6.7) mumol/L, p=0.001). The ratio of testosterone/DHEA-S increased\\n      significantly (2.4 (2.0, 2.8) vs. 3.1 (2.6, 3.7) nmol/mumol, p<0.001). After\\n      blood glucose normalization with the short-term CSII therapy, 3beta-HSD increased\\n      from 11.0 (9.5, 12.5) pg/mL to 14.6 (13.5, 15.7) pg/mL, p=0.001, and 17beta-HSD\\n      increased from 20.7 (16.3, 25.2) pg/mL to 28.2 (23.8, 32.5) pg/mL, p=0.009.\\n      Conclusions: Blood glucose normalization via short-term intensive insulin therapy\\n      increases plasma total testosterone levels in men with newly diagnosed type 2\\n      diabetes, associated with a decreased level of DHEA-S, probably because of the\\n      enhanced conversion from DHEA to testosterone catalyzed by 3beta-HSD and\\n      17beta-HSD.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Hu, Wang, Cai, Liu, Li, Ma and Ding.\\nFAU - Hu, Yun\\nAU  - Hu Y\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, \\n      Nanjing, China.\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Wuxi People\\'s Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical\\n      University, Wuxi, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Ying\\nAU  - Wang Y\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, \\n      Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Cai, Ting-Ting\\nAU  - Cai TT\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, \\n      Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Lu\\nAU  - Liu L\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Chunjiang People\\'s Hospital, Changzhou, China.\\nFAU - Li, Dong-Mei\\nAU  - Li DM\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, \\n      Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Ma, Jian-Hua\\nAU  - Ma JH\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, \\n      Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Ding, Bo\\nAU  - Ding B\\nAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, \\n      Nanjing, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)\\nJT  - Frontiers in endocrinology\\nJID - 101555782\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9344891\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase\\nOT  - dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate\\nOT  - diabetes mellitus\\nOT  - insulin\\nOT  - testosterone\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/03/12 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/29 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.894743 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2022 Jul 19;13:894743. doi:\\n      10.3389/fendo.2022.894743. eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928896\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1664-2392 (Print)\\nIS  - 1664-2392 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Correlation Between Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis and Chest CT-Measured\\n      Erector Spinae Muscle Area: A Cross-Sectional Study.\\nPG  - 923200\\nLID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.923200 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) plays an important part in diverse health \\n      and disease states. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and computed\\n      tomography (CT) are available for its assessment. However, muscle mass assessed\\n      by BIA may be influenced by multiple factors. The erector spinae muscle area\\n      (ESA) on chest CT is recently presumed to be representative of SMM. This study\\n      aimed to derive BIA from the ESA and evaluate the magnitude of association\\n      (between ESA measured from chest CT) and BIA. Methods: Subjects hospitalized for \\n      health checkups between December 2020 and December 2021, having undergone both\\n      BIA (50 kHz, 0.8 mA) and chest CT, were included. ESA was quantified at the level\\n      of the 12th thoracic vertebra (T12-ESA) by a standardized semi-automated\\n      segmentation algorithm. Low SMM was defined using the Asian Working Group for\\n      Sarcopenia criteria. The association between T12-ESA and BIA was then evaluated. \\n      Stratified analyses by sex and BMI were also performed. Results: Among 606\\n      included subjects (59.7 +/- 16.6 years, 63.5% male), 110 (18.2%) had low SMM. BMI\\n      in low and normal SMM groups was 20.1 and 24.7 kg/m(2), respectively. Current\\n      smoking, drinking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic renal\\n      dysfunction were more frequently seen in the low SMM group than in the normal SMM\\n      group. The final regression model included T12-ESA, weight, BMI, and age, and had\\n      an adjusted R (2) of 0.806 with BIA. In the validation group, the correlation\\n      between T12-ESA-derived BIA and BIA remained high (Pearson correlation = 0.899). \\n      Stratified analysis disclosed a stronger correlation between T12-ESA and BIA in\\n      male subjects than in female subjects (adjusted R (2) = 0.790 vs. adjusted R (2) \\n      = 0.711, p < 0.05), and a better correlation was observed in obese (BMI >/= 30\\n      kg/m(2)) compared with underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2)) subjects (adjusted R (2\\n      =) 0.852 vs. adjusted R (2) = 0.723, p < 0.05). Additional analysis revealed a\\n      significant correlation between T12-ESA and skeletal muscle cross-sectional area \\n      at the 3rd lumbar vertebra (L3-CSA) (adjusted R (2) = 0.935, p < 0.001).\\n      Conclusions: CT-based assessment of ESA at the T12 level is feasible and\\n      correlated well with BIA, especially in male subjects and obese subjects.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Cao, Zuo, Han, Liu, Liu, Zhang, Weng, Jin, Chen and Hu.\\nFAU - Cao, Jie\\nAU  - Cao J\\nAD  - Department of Geriatrics, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong\\n      University, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Zuo, Didi\\nAU  - Zuo D\\nAD  - Department of Geriatrics, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong\\n      University, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Han, Tingting\\nAU  - Han T\\nAD  - Department of Geriatrics, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong\\n      University, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Hongxia\\nAU  - Liu H\\nAD  - Department of Geriatrics, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong\\n      University, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Wenwen\\nAU  - Liu W\\nAD  - Department of Geriatrics, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong\\n      University, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Jia\\nAU  - Zhang J\\nAD  - Department of Geriatrics, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong\\n      University, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Weng, Yurong\\nAU  - Weng Y\\nAD  - Department of Geriatrics, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong\\n      University, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Jin, Xian\\nAU  - Jin X\\nAD  - Department of Geriatrics, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong\\n      University, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Zengai\\nAU  - Chen Z\\nAD  - Department of Radiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of \\n      Medicine, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Hu, Yaomin\\nAU  - Hu Y\\nAD  - Department of Geriatrics, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong\\n      University, Shanghai, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)\\nJT  - Frontiers in endocrinology\\nJID - 101555782\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9343984\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - L3 skeletal muscle mass area\\nOT  - T12 erector spinae muscle area\\nOT  - bioelectrical impedance analysis\\nOT  - computed tomography\\nOT  - skeletal muscle mass\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/04/19 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/01 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.923200 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2022 Jul 19;13:923200. doi:\\n      10.3389/fendo.2022.923200. eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928895\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1664-2392 (Print)\\nIS  - 1664-2392 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Association of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease With Left\\n      Ventricular Diastolic Function and Cardiac Morphology.\\nPG  - 935390\\nLID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.935390 [doi]\\nAB  - Background and Aim: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely related \\n      to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). A newly proposed definition is metabolic\\n      dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), which was changed from NAFLD.\\n      The clinical effect of this change on abnormalities of cardiac structure and\\n      function is yet unknown. We aimed to examine whether MAFLD is associated with\\n      left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) and cardiac remolding and\\n      further identify the impact of different subgroups and severity of MAFLD. Method:\\n      We evaluated 228 participants without known CVDs. Participants were categorized\\n      by the presence of MAFLD and the normal group. Then, patients with MAFLD were\\n      subclassified into three subgroups: MAFLD patients with diabetes (diabetes\\n      subgroup), overweight/obesity patients (overweight/obesity subgroup), and\\n      lean/normal-weight patients who had two metabolic risk abnormalities (lean\\n      metabolic dysfunction subgroup). Furthermore, the severity of hepatic steatosis\\n      was assessed by transient elastography (FibroScan((R))) with a controlled\\n      attenuation parameter (CAP), and patients with MAFLD were divided into normal,\\n      mild, moderate, and severe hepatic steatosis groups based on CAP value. Cardiac\\n      structure and function were examined by echocardiography. Results: LVDD was\\n      significantly more prevalent in the MAFLD group (24.6% vs. 60.8%, p < 0.001)\\n      compared to the normal group. The overweight subgroup and diabetes subgroup were \\n      significantly associated with signs of cardiac remolding, including\\n      interventricular septum thickness, LV posterior wall thickness, left atrial\\n      diameter (all p < 0.05), relative wall thickness, and LV mass index (all p <\\n      0.05). Additionally, moderate-to-to severe steatosis patients had higher risks\\n      for LVDD and cardiac remolding (all p-values < 0.05). Conclusion: MAFLD was\\n      associated with LVDD and cardiac remolding, especially in patients with diabetes,\\n      overweight patients, and moderate-to-to severe steatosis patients. This study\\n      provides theoretical support for the precise prevention of cardiovascular\\n      dysfunction in patients with MAFLD.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Peng, Yu, Wang, Shi, Sun, Zhang, Zhao, Chen, Tang, Wang, Ni,\\n      Wen and Jiang.\\nFAU - Peng, Dandan\\nAU  - Peng D\\nAD  - School of Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.\\nFAU - Yu, Zhenqiu\\nAU  - Yu Z\\nAD  - The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Medical\\n      University, Guiyang, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Mingwei\\nAU  - Wang M\\nAD  - Hangzhou Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou\\n      Normal University, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Shi, Junping\\nAU  - Shi J\\nAD  - Department of Hepatology, The Affiliated Hospital and Institute of Hepatology and\\n      Metabolic Disease, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Sun, Lei\\nAU  - Sun L\\nAD  - Department of Hepatology, The Affiliated Hospital and Institute of Hepatology and\\n      Metabolic Disease, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Yuanyuan\\nAU  - Zhang Y\\nAD  - Department of Cardiovascular Ultrasonic Center, First Affiliated Hospital,\\n      College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Zhao, Wenbin\\nAU  - Zhao W\\nAD  - Hangzhou Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou\\n      Normal University, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Chen\\nAU  - Chen C\\nAD  - Hangzhou Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou\\n      Normal University, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Tang, Jiake\\nAU  - Tang J\\nAD  - Hangzhou Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou\\n      Normal University, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Chunyi\\nAU  - Wang C\\nAD  - Hangzhou Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou\\n      Normal University, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Ni, Jie\\nAU  - Ni J\\nAD  - Hangzhou Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou\\n      Normal University, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Wen, Wen\\nAU  - Wen W\\nAD  - Hangzhou Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou\\n      Normal University, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Jiang, Jingjie\\nAU  - Jiang J\\nAD  - Hangzhou Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou\\n      Normal University, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)\\nJT  - Frontiers in endocrinology\\nJID - 101555782\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9345495\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - cardiac remodeling\\nOT  - left ventricular diastolic dysfunction\\nOT  - metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease\\nOT  - obesity\\nOT  - type 2 diabetes mellitus\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/05/03 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/03 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.935390 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2022 Jul 19;13:935390. doi:\\n      10.3389/fendo.2022.935390. eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928890\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1664-2392 (Print)\\nIS  - 1664-2392 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Sarcopenic Obesity in Individuals With Neurodisabilities: The SarcObeNDS Study.\\nPG  - 868298\\nLID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.868298 [doi]\\nAB  - Introduction: Patients with neurodisabilities (NDS) are prone to alterations in\\n      body composition. Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is a condition characterized by\\n      increased adipose tissue accompanied by sarcopenia. The aim of this study was to \\n      investigate the prevalence of SO in patients with NDS, including stroke, spinal\\n      cord, and traumatic brain injuries. Methods: The study Sarcopenic Obesity in\\n      NeuroDisabled Subjects (acronym: SarcObeNDS) was a cross-sectional study of\\n      hospitalized patients (n = 82) and healthy controls (n = 32) with a mean age of\\n      60.00 +/- 14.22 years old. SO and sarcopenia were assessed through total body fat\\n      % (TBF %), fat mass index (fat mass to height(2): FMI = FM/h(2); kg/m(2)), and\\n      skeletal muscle index (appendicular skeletal muscle to height(2): SMI = ASM/h(2);\\n      kg/m(2)) via full-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This study was\\n      registered in the international database ClinicalTrials.gov with the unique\\n      identification number NCT03863379. Results: A statistically significant\\n      difference was found in SMI (7.18 +/- 0.95 vs. 6.00 +/- 1.13 kg/m(2), p < 0.001) \\n      between controls and patients with NDS. No statistical significance was found for\\n      TBF (p = 0.783) and FMI (p = 0.143) between groups. The results remained the same\\n      after controlling the results for gender and BMI. A strong positive correlation\\n      was demonstrated between BMI and TBF for the total population (r = 0.616, p <\\n      0.001), the control group (r = 0.616, p < 0.001), and patients with NDS (r =\\n      0.728, p < 0.001). Conclusion: In summary, we observed significantly lower BMI\\n      and SMI scores in both genders compared to healthy controls. At the clinical\\n      level, a timely diagnosis and rapid treatment of sarcopenia and/or obesity in\\n      this population may prevent further metabolic repercussions accompanied by higher\\n      functional decline and lower quality of life.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Dionyssiotis, Prokopidis, Trovas, Papadatou, Ananidis,\\n      Tragoulias, Lazarou, Christaki, Domazou, Galanos and Tyllianakis.\\nFAU - Dionyssiotis, Yannis\\nAU  - Dionyssiotis Y\\nAD  - Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Clinic, Patras University Hospital, Patras,\\n      Greece.\\nAD  - Laboratory for Research of the Musculoskeletal System, National and Kapodistrian \\n      University of Athens, Kifissia, Greece.\\nAD  - 1st Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department, National Rehabilitation\\n      Center EKA, Athens, Greece.\\nFAU - Prokopidis, Konstantinos\\nAU  - Prokopidis K\\nAD  - Department of Musculoskeletal Biology, Institute of Life Course and Medical\\n      Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.\\nFAU - Trovas, George\\nAU  - Trovas G\\nAD  - Laboratory for Research of the Musculoskeletal System, National and Kapodistrian \\n      University of Athens, Kifissia, Greece.\\nFAU - Papadatou, Maria-Christina\\nAU  - Papadatou MC\\nAD  - Laboratory for Research of the Musculoskeletal System, National and Kapodistrian \\n      University of Athens, Kifissia, Greece.\\nAD  - 1st Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department, National Rehabilitation\\n      Center EKA, Athens, Greece.\\nFAU - Ananidis, Nikolaos\\nAU  - Ananidis N\\nAD  - 1st Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department, National Rehabilitation\\n      Center EKA, Athens, Greece.\\nFAU - Tragoulias, Vasileios\\nAU  - Tragoulias V\\nAD  - 1st Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department, National Rehabilitation\\n      Center EKA, Athens, Greece.\\nFAU - Lazarou, Eleni\\nAU  - Lazarou E\\nAD  - Radiology Department, National Rehabilitation Center EKA, Athens, Greece.\\nFAU - Christaki, Evangelia\\nAU  - Christaki E\\nAD  - Radiology Department, National Rehabilitation Center EKA, Athens, Greece.\\nFAU - Domazou, Marilena\\nAU  - Domazou M\\nAD  - Radiology Department, National Rehabilitation Center EKA, Athens, Greece.\\nFAU - Galanos, Antonios\\nAU  - Galanos A\\nAD  - Laboratory for Research of the Musculoskeletal System, National and Kapodistrian \\n      University of Athens, Kifissia, Greece.\\nFAU - Tyllianakis, Minos\\nAU  - Tyllianakis M\\nAD  - Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Clinic, Patras University Hospital, Patras,\\n      Greece.\\nLA  - eng\\nSI  - ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03863379\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)\\nJT  - Frontiers in endocrinology\\nJID - 101555782\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9343584\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - sarcopenia\\nOT  - sarcopenic obesity\\nOT  - skeletal mass index\\nOT  - spinal cord injury\\nOT  - stroke\\nOT  - traumatic brain injury\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/02/02 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/14 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.868298 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2022 Jul 19;13:868298. doi:\\n      10.3389/fendo.2022.868298. eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928888\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1664-2392 (Print)\\nIS  - 1664-2392 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - The Relative Body Weight Gain From Early to Middle Life Adulthood Associated With\\n      Later Life Risk of Diabetes: A Nationwide Cohort Study.\\nPG  - 927067\\nLID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.927067 [doi]\\nAB  - Aim: To determine the effect of decade-based body weight gain from 20 to 50 years\\n      of age on later life diabetes risk. Methods: 35,611 non-diabetic participants\\n      aged >/= 50 years from a well-defined nationwide cohort were followed up for\\n      average of 3.6 years, with cardiovascular diseases and cancers at baseline were\\n      excluded. Body weight at 20, 30, 40, and 50 years was reported. The overall 30\\n      years and each 10-year weight gain were calculated from the early and middle\\n      life. Cox regression models were used to estimate risks of incident diabetes.\\n      Results: After 127,745.26 person-years of follow-up, 2,789 incident diabetes were\\n      identified (incidence rate, 2.18%) in 25,289 women (mean weight gain 20-50 years,\\n      7.60 kg) and 10,322 men (7.93 kg). Each 10-kg weight gain over the 30 years was\\n      significantly associated with a 39.7% increased risk of incident diabetes (95%\\n      confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.47); weight gain from 20-30 years showed a more \\n      prominent effect on the risk of developing diabetes before 60 years than that of \\n      after 60 years (Hazard ratio, HR = 1.084, 95% CI [1.049-1.121], P <0.0001 vs.\\n      1.015 [0.975-1.056], P = 0.4643; P Interaction=0.0293). It showed a stable effect\\n      of the three 10-year intervals weight gain on risk of diabetes after 60 years\\n      (HR=1.055, 1.038, 1.043, respectively, all P < 0.0036). Conclusions: The early\\n      life weight gain showed a more prominent effect on developing diabetes before 60 \\n      years than after 60 years; however, each-decade weight gain from 20 to 50 years\\n      showed a similar effect on risk developing diabetes after 60 years.\\nCI  -

Therefore, the effects of\\n      exercise on glucose and blood lipid levels at different times of the day may\\n      differ. This study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term endurance\\n      exercise intervention in the morning versus late afternoon on 24-h blood glucose \\n      variability and blood lipid levels. Methods: Twelve healthy young men\\n      participated in a randomized crossover trial. The participants were assigned to\\n      morning (09:00-11:00) or late afternoon (16:00-18:00) endurance exercise for a\\n      week, consisting of supervised exercise sessions on Mondays, Wednesdays, and\\n      Fridays. In the morning and evening trials, the participants walked for 60 min on\\n      a treadmill at approximately 60% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Following a\\n      2-week wash-out period, the participants performed the exercise training regimen \\n      at another time point. Continuous glucose monitoring was used to evaluate blood\\n      glucose fluctuations during each 24-h trial period. Blood samples were collected \\n      before and after each intervention to examine blood lipid and hormonal responses.\\n      Results: Examination of the area under the curve (AUC) of the glucose level\\n      changes for 24 h after the late afternoon versus morning exercise intervention\\n      revealed significantly lower values for the former versus the latter (P < 0.01). \\n      The AUC of glucose level changes after each meal was also lower after the late\\n      afternoon versus morning intervention, and significantly lower values were\\n      observed in the late afternoon versus morning trial for breakfast and dinner (P <\\n      0.05, P < 0.01). In addition, a significant decrease in triglycerides (TG) and\\n      TG/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was noted after versus before the\\n      late afternoon intervention (P < 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that\\n      late afternoon endurance exercise is more effective than morning endurance\\n      exercise at improving 24-h glucose and triglyceride levels.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Kim, Furuhashi, Takahashi, Chijiki, Nanba, Inami, Radak,\\n      Sakamoto and Shibata.\\nFAU - Kim, Hyeon-Ki\\nAU  - Kim HK\\nAD  - Faculty of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan.\\nAD  - Institute of Physical Education, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan.\\nFAU - Furuhashi, Shota\\nAU  - Furuhashi S\\nAD  - Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo,\\n      Japan.\\nFAU - Takahashi, Masaki\\nAU  - Takahashi M\\nAD  - Institute for Liberal Arts, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan.\\nFAU - Chijiki, Hanako\\nAU  - Chijiki H\\nAD  - Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo,\\n      Japan.\\nFAU - Nanba, Takuya\\nAU  - Nanba T\\nAD  - Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo,\\n      Japan.\\nFAU - Inami, Takayuki\\nAU  - Inami T\\nAD  - Institute of Physical Education, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan.\\nFAU - Radak, Zsolt\\nAU  - Radak Z\\nAD  - Faculty of Sport Sciences, Waseda University, Saitama, Japan.\\nAD  - Research Center for Molecular Exercise Science, University of Physical Education,\\n      Budapest, Hungary.\\nFAU - Sakamoto, Shizuo\\nAU  - Sakamoto S\\nAD  - Faculty of Sport Sciences, Surugadai University, Saitama, Japan.\\nFAU - Shibata, Shigenobu\\nAU  - Shibata S\\nAD  - Faculty of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)\\nJT  - Frontiers in endocrinology\\nJID - 101555782\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9343590\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - chrono-exercise\\nOT  - endurance exercise\\nOT  - exercise timing\\nOT  - glucose levels\\nOT  - triglycerides\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/05/30 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/04 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.957239 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2022 Jul 19;13:957239. doi:\\n      10.3389/fendo.2022.957239. eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928880\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2234-943X (Print)\\nIS  - 2234-943X (Linking)\\nVI  - 12\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - A Nomogram Based on Hematological Parameters and Clinicopathological\\n      Characteristics for Predicting Local-Regional Recurrence After Breast-Conserving \\n      Therapy.\\nPG  - 861210\\nLID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.861210 [doi]\\nAB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the factors for local-regional \\n      recurrence (LRR) after breast-conserving therapy (BCT). We established a\\n      practical nomogram to predict the likelihood of LRR after BCT based on\\n      hematological parameters and clinicopathological features. Methods: A\\n      retrospective analysis was performed on 2,085 consecutive breast cancer patients \\n      who received BCT in Shandong Cancer Hospital from 2006 to 2016, including 1,460\\n      patients in the training cohort and 625 patients in the validation cohort.\\n      Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed based on hematological\\n      parameters (fibrinogen, platelets, mean platelet volume, neutrophils, monocytes, \\n      and lymphocytes) and clinicopathological characteristics to identify the\\n      independent factors for LRR. Subsequently, a nomogram for predicting LRR was\\n      established by logistic regression analysis. The nomogram was validated in 625\\n      patients in the validation cohort. Results: During the median follow-up period of\\n      66 months, 44 (3.01%) patients in the training cohort and 19 (3.04%) patients in \\n      the validation cohort suffered from LRR. Multivariate analysis showed six\\n      independent factors related to LRR, including molecular subtype, pathological N\\n      stage, re-resection, radiotherapy or not, platelet count*MPV*fibrinogen (PMF),\\n      and neutrophil count/lymphocyte count ratio (NLR). Six variables were entered\\n      into logistic regression to establish the nomogram for predicting LRR. The\\n      nomogram of LRR showed excellent discrimination and prediction accuracy. The area\\n      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.89 (p < 0.001, 95% \\n      CI = 0.83, 0.95) in the training cohort and 0.88 (p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.8, 0.96) \\n      in the validation cohort. Calibration curves for the prediction model in the\\n      training and validation cohorts both demonstrated satisfactory consistency\\n      between the nomogram-predicted and actual LRR. Conclusion: The combination of\\n      hematological parameters and clinicopathological characteristics can predict LRR \\n      after BCT. The predictive nomogram based on preoperative and postoperative\\n      indicators of BCT might serve as a practical tool for individualized\\n      prognostication. More prospective studies should be performed to verify the\\n      model.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Sun, Zhao, Wang, Song, Wang, Li and Yu.\\nFAU - Sun, Luhao\\nAU  - Sun L\\nAD  - Breast Cancer Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First\\n      Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Zhao, Wei\\nAU  - Zhao W\\nAD  - Breast Cancer Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First\\n      Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Fukai\\nAU  - Wang F\\nAD  - Breast Cancer Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First\\n      Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Song, Xiang\\nAU  - Song X\\nAD  - Breast Cancer Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First\\n      Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Xinzhao\\nAU  - Wang X\\nAD  - Breast Cancer Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First\\n      Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Li, Chao\\nAU  - Li C\\nAD  - Breast Cancer Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First\\n      Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Yu, Zhiyong\\nAU  - Yu Z\\nAD  - Breast Cancer Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First\\n      Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Oncol\\nJT  - Frontiers in oncology\\nJID - 101568867\\nPMC - PMC9344968\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - breast-conserving therapy\\nOT  - clinicopathological characteristics\\nOT  - hematological parameters\\nOT  - local-regional recurrence\\nOT  - nomogram\\nOT  - predicting model\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/01/24 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/13 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.861210 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Oncol. 2022 Jul 19;12:861210. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2022.861210. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928878\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2234-943X (Print)\\nIS  - 2234-943X (Linking)\\nVI  - 12\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Predictive Value of the Log Odds of Negative Lymph Nodes/T Stage as a Novel\\n      Prognostic Factor in Bladder Cancer Patients After Radical Cystectomy.\\nPG  - 895413\\nLID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.895413 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: The effect of lymph node resection on the prognosis of bladder cancer\\n      (BLCA) patients receiving radical cystectomy should not be ignored. Our aim was\\n      to explore the prognostic value of the log odds of negative lymph nodes/T stage\\n      (LONT) and construct a more effective nomogram based on LONT to predict\\n      cancer-specific survival (CSS) in postoperative BLCA patients. Methods: Patients \\n      diagnosed with BLCA after radical cystectomy between 2004 and 2015 in the\\n      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were enrolled. We\\n      randomly split (7:3) these patients into the primary cohort and internal\\n      validation cohort. 86 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang\\n      University were collected as the external validation set. Univariate and\\n      multivariate cox regression analyses were carried out to seek prognostic factors \\n      of postoperative BLCA patients. According to these significantly prognostic\\n      factors, a simple-to-use nomogram was established for predicting CSS. Their\\n      performances were evaluated by using calibration curves, the concordance index\\n      (C-index), the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and decision curve\\n      analysis (DCA). In addition, different risk groups were tested by Kaplan-Meier\\n      curves and log-rank tests. Result: Whether in cancer-specific survival (CSS) or\\n      overall survival (OS), LONT was an independent and significant prognostic factor.\\n      Through further screening, the ultimate nomogram of CSS was composed of nine\\n      independent prognostic factors including LONT, age, race, tumor size, histologic \\n      type, T stage, N stage, summary stage and chemotherapy. The C-index of nomogram\\n      in the primary cohort, internal and external validation cohort were 0.734, 0.720 \\n      and 0.728, respectively. The AUC of predicting CSS at 3 and 5 years were 0.783\\n      and 0.774 in the primary cohort and 0.781 and 0.781 in the validation cohort. The\\n      results of calibration and DCA showed good concordance and clinical\\n      applicability. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were displayed in CSS among\\n      different risk groups. Conclusion: LONT was regarded as a novel and reliable\\n      prognostic factor. Compared with the AJCC staging system, the established\\n      nomogram based on LONT can more effectively predict the prognosis of BLCA\\n      patients after radical cystectomy.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Chen, Zhan, Chen, Jiang, Wan, Fu and Chen.\\nFAU - Chen, Tao\\nAU  - Chen T\\nAD  - Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University,\\n      Nanchang City, China.\\nFAU - Zhan, Xiangpeng\\nAU  - Zhan X\\nAD  - Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University,\\n      Nanchang City, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Xinpeng\\nAU  - Chen X\\nAD  - The First Clinical Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang City, China.\\nFAU - Jiang, Ming\\nAU  - Jiang M\\nAD  - Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University,\\n      Nanchang City, China.\\nFAU - Wan, Hao\\nAU  - Wan H\\nAD  - Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University,\\n      Nanchang City, China.\\nFAU - Fu, Bin\\nAU  - Fu B\\nAD  - Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University,\\n      Nanchang City, China.\\nAD  - Jiangxi Institute of Urology, Nanchang City, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Luyao\\nAU  - Chen L\\nAD  - Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University,\\n      Nanchang City, China.\\nAD  - Jiangxi Institute of Urology, Nanchang City, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Oncol\\nJT  - Frontiers in oncology\\nJID - 101568867\\nPMC - PMC9343753\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - SEER\\nOT  - bladder cancer\\nOT  - log odds of negative lymph nodes/T stage\\nOT  - nomogram\\nOT  - prognosis\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/03/13 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/07 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.895413 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Oncol. 2022 Jul 19;12:895413. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2022.895413. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928872\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2234-943X (Print)\\nIS  - 2234-943X (Linking)\\nVI  - 12\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Cell-Free DNA Sequencing of Intraocular Fluid as Liquid Biopsy in the Diagnosis\\n      of Vitreoretinal Lymphoma.\\nPG  - 932674\\nLID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.932674 [doi]\\nAB  - Purpose: To seek novel diagnostic approaches, we improved the workflow of\\n      cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing and evaluated its feasibility in vitreoretinal\\n      lymphoma (VRL) specimens; the profile of mutations was preliminarily analyzed for\\n      potential diagnostic value. Methods: The study was a diagnostic trial. 23 eyes of\\n      23 patients with VRL and 25 eyes of 25 patients with inflammatory eye diseases\\n      were enrolled. Approximate 500mul undiluted vitreous humor and 10ml diluted\\n      vitreous fluid was obtained through diagnostic vitrectomy and sent for\\n      cytopathological examinations. 500mul of the diluted vitreous fluid was spared\\n      for cfDNA sequencing. For cfDNA sequencing, DNA fragmentation procedure was added\\n      to the workflow to improve the extraction efficiency; mutations detected were\\n      analyzed for potential diagnostic model. The sensitivity and specificity of the\\n      cytopathology and cfDNA sequencing were compared. The clinical manifestations\\n      were preliminarily analyzed for potential correlations with the genotypes.\\n      Results: CfDNA sequencing was accomplished in 23 eyes with VRL and 20 eyes with\\n      inflammatory eye diseases. VRL-related mutated genes included MYD88 (18 eyes,\\n      78%), ETV6 (11 eyes, 48%), PIM1 (11 eyes,48%), BTG2 (7 eyes, 30%), IRF4 (7 eyes, \\n      30%), CD79B (6 eyes, 26%), LRP1B (6 eyes, 26%), etc. Logistic regression based on\\n      the mutations of MYD88 and ETV6 was of the potential for the diagnosis of VRL\\n      (P<0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.789, sensitivity 0.913, specificity 0.950); by\\n      comparison, the sensitivity and specificity of the vitreous cytopathology were\\n      0.826 and 1.000, respectively. Further analysis of the mutation profile showed\\n      that patients carrying CD79B mutation tended to have higher intraocular\\n      interleukin-10 level (P=0.030), that CARD11 mutation was correlated with younger \\n      age at ocular onset (P=0.039), and that patients with intracranial involvement\\n      carried more multiple-site mutations in the BTG2 gene (P=0.013). Conclusions: The\\n      improved workflow of CfDNA sequencing is of sound feasibility in a limited amount\\n      of vitreous humor. The logistic model based on the mutations could help to\\n      provide reliable clues for the diagnosis of VRL.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Gu, Jiang, Liu, Ping, Li, Chen, Wang, Huang, Xu and Chang.\\nFAU -

This study aimed to investigate the short-term outcomes and\\n      survival outcomes of ICG-guided LH versus common laparoscopic hepatectomy (CLH)\\n      for HCC. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 104 ICG-guided LH and \\n      158 CLH patients from 2014 to 2020 at our center. To avoid selection bias, 81\\n      ICG-guided LH and 81 CLH cases were analyzed after 1:1 propensity score matching \\n      (PSM). The baseline data and results were compared between the two groups.\\n      Results: The baseline characteristics of both groups were comparable after\\n      matching. There was a significant difference in operative time: longer in the\\n      ICG-guided LH group than in the CLH group (p=0.004). However, there was no\\n      significant difference in operative time in anatomical resection between the two \\n      groups (p=0.987). There was a significant difference in operative time in\\n      non-anatomical resection: longer in the ICG-guided LH group than in the CLH group\\n      (p=0.001). There were no significant differences in positive surgery margin,\\n      blood loss, blood transfusion rate, postoperative complication rate,\\n      postoperative length of hospital stay, mortality within 30 days, and mortality\\n      within 90 days. The ICG-guided LH group appeared to have a trend towards better\\n      overall survival (OS), but there was no significant difference in OS (P=0.168)\\n      and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P=0.322) between the two groups. Conclusions:\\n      Although ICG fluorescence-guided LH is a timelier procedure to perform, it is a\\n      safe and effective technique with the advantages of intraoperative positioning,\\n      low postoperative complication rates, and potential to improve OS.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Jianxi, Xiongfeng, Zehao, Zhen, Tianyi, Ye, Haosheng, Zhixiang\\n      and Huiling.\\nFAU - Jianxi, Wang\\nAU  - Jianxi W\\nAD  - The Second School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou,\\n      China.\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Guangdong \\n      Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Xiongfeng, Zou\\nAU  - Xiongfeng Z\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Guangdong \\n      Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Zehao, Zheng\\nAU  - Zehao Z\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Guangdong \\n      Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Zhen, Zhao\\nAU  - Zhen Z\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Guangdong \\n      Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Tianyi, Peng\\nAU  - Tianyi P\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Guangdong \\n      Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Ye, Lin\\nAU  - Ye L\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Guangdong \\n      Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Haosheng, Jin\\nAU  - Haosheng J\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Guangdong \\n      Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Zhixiang, Jian\\nAU  - Zhixiang J\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Guangdong \\n      Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Huiling, Wang\\nAU  - Huiling W\\nAD  - The Second School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou,\\n      China.\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Guangdong Provincial People\\'s Hospital, Guangdong \\n      Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Oncol\\nJT  - Frontiers in oncology\\nJID - 101568867\\nPMC - PMC9343849\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - hepatectomy\\nOT  - hepatocellular carcinoma\\nOT  - indocyanine green\\nOT  - laparoscopy\\nOT  - outcomes\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:20\\nPHST- 2022/04/27 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/27 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:20 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.930065 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Oncol. 2022 Jul 19;12:930065. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2022.930065. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928862\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2234-943X (Print)\\nIS  - 2234-943X (Linking)\\nVI  - 12\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - The Role of Clonal Evolution on Progression, Blood Parameters, and Response to\\n      Therapy in Multiple Myeloma.\\nPG  - 919278\\nLID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.919278 [doi]\\nAB  - Introduction: A variety of biomarkers are considered for diagnosis (e.g.,\\n      beta2-microgobulin, albumin, or LDH) and prognosis [e.g., cytogenetic aberrations\\n      detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)] of multiple myeloma (MM). \\n      More recently, clonal evolution has been established as key. Little is known on\\n      the clinical implications of clonal evolution. Methods: We performed in-depth\\n      analyses of 25 patients with newly diagnosed MM with respect to detailed clinical\\n      information analyzing blood samples collected at several time points during\\n      follow-up (median follow-up: 3.26 years since first diagnosis). We split our\\n      cohort into two subgroups: with and without new FISH clones developing in the\\n      course of disease. Results: Each subgroup showed a characteristic chromosomal\\n      profile. Forty-three percent of patients had evidence of appearing new clones.\\n      The patients with new clones showed an increased number of translocations\\n      affecting chromosomes 14 (78% vs. 33%; p = 0.0805) and 11, and alterations in\\n      chromosome 4 (amplifications and translocations). New clones, on the contrary,\\n      were characterized by alterations affecting chromosome 17. Subsequent to the\\n      development of the new clone, 6 out of 9 patients experienced disease progression\\n      compared to 3 out of 12 for patients without new clones. Duration of the therapy \\n      applied for the longest time was significantly shorter within the group of\\n      patients developing new clones (median: 273 vs. 406.5 days; p = 0.0465).\\n      Discussion: We demonstrated that the development of new clones, carrying\\n      large-scale alterations, was associated with inferior disease course and shorter \\n      response to therapy, possibly affecting progression-free survival and overall\\n      survival as well. Further studies evaluating larger cohorts are necessary for the\\n      validation of our results.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Sandmann, Karsch, Bartel, Exeler, Brix, Mai, Varghese, Lenz\\n      and Khandanpour.\\nFAU - Sandmann, Sarah\\nAU  - Sandmann S\\nAD  - Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.\\nFAU - Karsch, Katharina\\nAU  - Karsch K\\nAD  - Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University\\n      Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.\\nFAU - Bartel, Peter\\nAU  - Bartel P\\nAD  - Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University\\n      Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.\\nFAU - Exeler, Rita\\nAU  - Exeler R\\nAD  - Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.\\nFAU - Brix, Tobias J\\nAU  - Brix TJ\\nAD  - Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.\\nFAU - Mai, Elias K\\nAU  - Mai EK\\nAD  - Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg,\\n      Germany.\\nFAU - Varghese, Julian\\nAU  - Varghese J\\nAD  - Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.\\nFAU - Lenz, Georg\\nAU  - Lenz G\\nAD  - Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University\\n      Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.\\nFAU - Khandanpour, Cyrus\\nAU  - Khandanpour C\\nAD  - Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University\\n      Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.\\nAD  - University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein Campus Lubeck, University of Lubeck,\\n      Lubeck, Germany.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Oncol\\nJT  - Frontiers in oncology\\nJID - 101568867\\nPMC - PMC9343617\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - chromosomal alteration\\nOT  - clonal evolution\\nOT  - multiple myeloma\\nOT  - prognosis\\nOT  - survival\\nCOIS- EKM reports consulting or Advisory Role, Honoraria, Research Funding, and Travel \\n      Accommodations and Expenses from Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene, GlaxoSmithKline,\\n      Janssen Cilag, Sanofi and Takeda.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the\\n      associations between the Paleolithic diet (PD) and the Paleolithic-like lifestyle\\n      and the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among an adult\\n      population. Materials and Methods: This case-control study was carried out among \\n      206 patients with NAFLD and 306 healthy subjects aged >18 years. PD score was\\n      evaluated using a validated 168-item quantitative food frequency questionnaire.\\n      In addition, to calculate the Paleolithic-like lifestyle score, the components of\\n      physical activity, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status of the participants \\n      were combined with the score of the PD. Results: The mean PD and Paleolithic-like\\n      lifestyle scores were 38.11 +/- 5.63 and 48.92 +/- 6.45, respectively. After\\n      adjustment for potential confounders, higher scores of adherence to the PD diet\\n      conferred a protection for the presence of NAFLD [odds ratio (OR): 0.53; 95%\\n      confidence interval (CI): 0.28-0.98; P for trend = 0.021]. Furthermore, PD and\\n      healthy lifestyle habits were negatively associated with NAFLD (OR = 0.42, 95% CI\\n      0.23-0.78; P for trend = 0.007). Conclusion: Our data suggest that the PD alone\\n      and in combination with lifestyle factors was associated with decreased risk of\\n      NAFLD in a significant manner in the overall population. However, prospective\\n      studies are needed to further investigate this association.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Sohouli, Fatahi, Izze da Silva Magalhaes, Rodrigues de\\n      Oliveira, Rohani, Ezoddin, Roshan and Hekmatdoost.\\nFAU - Sohouli, Mohammad Hassan\\nAU  - Sohouli MH\\nAD  - Student Research Committee, Department of Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics,\\n      Faculty of Nutrition and Food Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical\\n      Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\\nFAU - Fatahi, Somaye\\nAU  - Fatahi S\\nAD  - Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical\\n      Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\\nFAU - Izze da Silva Magalhaes, Elma\\nAU  - Izze da Silva Magalhaes E\\nAD  - Postgraduate Programme in Collective Health, Federal University of Maranhao, Sao \\n      Luis, Brazil.\\nFAU - Rodrigues de Oliveira, Bianca\\nAU  - Rodrigues de Oliveira B\\nAD  - Postgraduate Programme in Collective Health, Federal University of Maranhao, Sao \\n      Luis, Brazil.\\nFAU - Rohani, Pejman\\nAU  - Rohani P\\nAD  - Pediatrics Gastroenterology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine\\n      Children\\'s Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\\nFAU - Ezoddin, Neda\\nAU  - Ezoddin N\\nAD  - Pediatrics Gastroenterology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine\\n      Children\\'s Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\\nFAU - Roshan, Mehdi Mehdinezhad\\nAU  - Roshan MM\\nAD  - Department of Biology and Anatomical Sciences, School of Medicine, Shahid\\n      Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\\nFAU - Hekmatdoost, Azita\\nAU  - Hekmatdoost A\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Nutrition and Food\\n      Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Nutr\\nJT  - Frontiers in nutrition\\nJID - 101642264\\nPMC - PMC9343691\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - NAFLD\\nOT  - Paleolithic\\nOT  - case-control\\nOT  - chronic diseases\\nOT  - diet\\nOT  - lifestyle\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:19\\nPHST- 2022/05/09 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/23 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:19 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.934845 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Nutr. 2022 Jul 19;9:934845. doi: 10.3389/fnut.2022.934845. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928839\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2296-861X (Print)\\nIS  - 2296-861X (Linking)\\nVI  - 9\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Improvement of hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus female symbol x E.\\n      lanceolatus male symbol) by enzyme-digested poultry by-product: Growth\\n      performance, amino acid and peptide transport capacity, and intestinal\\n      morphology.\\nPG  - 955734\\nLID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.955734 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: At present, fish meal (FM) resources are in short supply, and\\n      competition for food between humans and animals is becoming increasingly\\n      critical.

Verification using corn\\n      flour and corn starch showed a significant increase in RS contents from 15.84 to \\n      27.78% and from 15.27 to 32.53%, respectively, and a significant decrease in\\n      starch digestibility from 67.02 to 35.74% and from 76.15 to 28.09%, respectively.\\n      Treated sample also showed the pasting profile that was stable under heating and \\n      stirring.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Faridah, Silitonga, Indrasti, Afandi, Jayanegara and Anugerah.\\nFAU - Faridah, Didah Nur\\nAU  - Faridah DN\\nAD  - Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agricultural Engineering\\n      Technology, IPB University, Bogor, Indonesia.\\nAD  - Southeast Asia Food and Agricultural Science and Technology (SEAFAST) Center,\\n      Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat, Institut Pertanian Bogor\\n      University, Bogor, Indonesia.\\nFAU - Silitonga, Rhoito Frista\\nAU  - Silitonga RF\\nAD  - Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agricultural Engineering\\n      Technology, IPB University, Bogor, Indonesia.\\nAD  - Center for Agro-Based Industry, Ministry of Industry, Bogor, Indonesia.\\nFAU - Indrasti, Dias\\nAU  - Indrasti D\\nAD  - Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agricultural Engineering\\n      Technology, IPB University, Bogor, Indonesia.\\nAD  - Southeast Asia Food and Agricultural Science and Technology (SEAFAST) Center,\\n      Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat, Institut Pertanian Bogor\\n      University, Bogor, Indonesia.\\nFAU - Afandi, Frendy Ahmad\\nAU  - Afandi FA\\nAD  - Deputy Ministry for Food and Agribusiness, Coordinating Ministry for Economic\\n      Affairs Republic of Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia.\\nFAU - Jayanegara, Anuraga\\nAU  - Jayanegara A\\nAD  - Department of Nutrition and Feed Technology, Faculty of Animal Science, Institut \\n      Pertanian Bogor University, Bogor, Indonesia.\\nFAU - Anugerah, Maria Putri\\nAU  - Anugerah MP\\nAD  - Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agricultural Engineering\\n      Technology, IPB University, Bogor, Indonesia.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Nutr\\nJT  - Frontiers in nutrition\\nJID - 101642264\\nPMC - PMC9343710\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - autoclaving-cooling\\nOT  - cereal\\nOT  - meta-analysis\\nOT  - resistant starch\\nOT  - starch modification\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:19\\nPHST- 2022/03/25 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/30 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:19 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.904700 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Nutr. 2022 Jul 19;9:904700. doi: 10.3389/fnut.2022.904700. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928835\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2296-861X (Print)\\nIS  - 2296-861X (Linking)\\nVI  - 9\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Integrative analysis of the metabolome and transcriptome reveals the molecular\\n      mechanism of chlorogenic acid synthesis in peach fruit.\\nPG  - 961626\\nLID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.961626 [doi]\\nAB  - As the most abundant phenolic acid in peach fruit, chlorogenic acid (CGA) is an\\n      important entry point for the development of natural dietary supplements and\\n      functional foods. However, the metabolic and regulation mechanisms underlying its\\n      accumulation in peach fruits remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the\\n      composition and content of CGAs in mature fruits of 205 peach cultivars. In peach\\n      fruits, three forms of CGA (52.57%), neochlorogenic acid (NCGA, 47.13%), and\\n      cryptochlorogenic acid (CCGA, 0.30%) were identified. During the growth and\\n      development of peach fruits, the content of CGAs generally showed a trend of\\n      rising first and then decreasing. Notably, the contents of quinic acid, shikimic \\n      acid, p-coumaroyl quinic acid, and caffeoyl shikimic acid all showed similar\\n      dynamic patterns to that of CGA, which might provide the precursor material basis\\n      for the accumulation of CGA in the later stage. Moreover, CGA, lignin, and\\n      anthocyanins might have a certain correlation and these compounds work together\\n      to maintain a dynamic balance. By the comparative transcriptome analysis, 8\\n      structural genes (Pp4CL, PpCYP98A, and PpHCT) and 15 regulatory genes (PpMYB,\\n      PpWRKY, PpERF, PpbHLH, and PpWD40) were initially screened as candidate genes of \\n      CGA biosynthesis. Our findings preliminarily analyzed the metabolic and molecular\\n      regulation mechanisms of CGA biosynthesis in peach fruit, which provided a\\n      theoretical basis for developing high-CGA content peaches in future breeding\\n      programs.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Su, Jia, Sun, Cai, Shen, Zhao, Li, Ma, Yu and Yan.\\nFAU - Su, Ziwen\\nAU  - Su Z\\nAD  - Institute of Pomology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiangsu Key\\n      Laboratory for Horticultural Crop Genetic Improvement, Nanjing, China.\\nAD  - College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Jia, Haoran\\nAU  - Jia H\\nAD  - College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.\\nAD  - College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Sun, Meng\\nAU  - Sun M\\nAD  - Institute of Pomology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiangsu Key\\n      Laboratory for Horticultural Crop Genetic Improvement, Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Cai, Zhixiang\\nAU  - Cai Z\\nAD  - Institute of Pomology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiangsu Key\\n      Laboratory for Horticultural Crop Genetic Improvement, Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Shen, Zhijun\\nAU  - Shen Z\\nAD  - Institute of Pomology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiangsu Key\\n      Laboratory for Horticultural Crop Genetic Improvement, Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Zhao, Bintao\\nAU  - Zhao B\\nAD  - Institute of Pomology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiangsu Key\\n      Laboratory for Horticultural Crop Genetic Improvement, Nanjing, China.\\nAD  - College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Li, Jiyao\\nAU  - Li J\\nAD  - Institute of Pomology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiangsu Key\\n      Laboratory for Horticultural Crop Genetic Improvement, Nanjing, China.\\nAD  - College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Ma, Ruijuan\\nAU  - Ma R\\nAD  - Institute of Pomology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiangsu Key\\n      Laboratory for Horticultural Crop Genetic Improvement, Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Yu, Mingliang\\nAU  - Yu M\\nAD  - Institute of Pomology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiangsu Key\\n      Laboratory for Horticultural Crop Genetic Improvement, Nanjing, China.\\nAD  - College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Yan, Juan\\nAU  - Yan J\\nAD  - Institute of Pomology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiangsu Key\\n      Laboratory for Horticultural Crop Genetic Improvement, Nanjing, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Nutr\\nJT  - Frontiers in nutrition\\nJID - 101642264\\nPMC - PMC9344011\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - candidate genes\\nOT  - chlorogenic acid\\nOT  - metabolome\\nOT  - peach\\nOT  - transcriptome\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:19\\nPHST- 2022/06/05 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/30 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:19 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.961626 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Nutr. 2022 Jul 19;9:961626. doi: 10.3389/fnut.2022.961626. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928833\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2296-861X (Print)\\nIS  - 2296-861X (Linking)\\nVI  - 9\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Prevalence, correlates, and gender disparities related to eating disordered\\n      behaviors among health science students and healthcare practitioners in Lebanon: \\n      Findings of a national cross sectional study.\\nPG  - 956310\\nLID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.956310 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: The raised prevalence of eating disorders (ED) amongst health science\\n      students and health professionals is of mounting concern. This study aims to\\n      determine the prevalence and correlates of eating disorders risk amongst a sample\\n      of Lebanese health science students and healthcare practitioners of both genders.\\n      Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled a convenient sample of 1,000\\n      participants (mean age: 23 +/- 5.4; females: 74.9%) from faculties of health\\n      sciences, clinics, pharmacies, and hospitals. The validated Eating Attitudes Test\\n      (EAT-26) was used to screen for eating disorders. Anthropometric data were\\n      self-reported by respondents to assess their nutritional status. Results: The\\n      risk of eating disorders was prevalent in 22.5% of participants. Females were at \\n      higher risk of ED compared to males p = 0.03. Eating disorders risk did not\\n      differ between students and practitioners (p = 0.3). The highest proportion of\\n      high-risk participants were students studying nutrition and practitioners\\n      (40.9%), outracing their counterparts in nursing (18.7%), medicine (17.8%),\\n      pharmacy (17.7%), and midwifery (4.9%) sciences (p = 0.02). Most high-risk\\n      participants had normal body weight (60.4%), and 28.9% were overweight (p =\\n      0.001). Female gender, nutrition profession, and dieting were associated with\\n      increasing the odd of ED. Particularly, dieting increased the risk around five\\n      times. Further, each 3 participants over 10 were facing binge eating behavior.\\n      Conclusion: This study uncovers an undervalued profession-related-health-disorder\\n      in Lebanese health science students and healthcare practitioners.

Symmetry\\n      following cleft surgery was compared to that of non-cleft children. Design:\\n      Retrospective study of photographs of children aged 5 years. Setting: Three\\n      decades of post-operative photographs of children treated by Millard and Pigott. \\n      Patients: Eighty-nine children treated by Millard, 87 by Pigott and 91 non-cleft \\n      children. Interventions: Photographs were assessed using the Symnose Computer\\n      program, a rapid semi-objective quantitative assessment of lip symmetry. Main\\n      Outcome Measures: Asymmetry score for each surgeon, and non-cleft children.\\n      Results: There was no significant difference in the median lip % mismatch score\\n      of Millard, 36.65% and Pigott, 38.52%. Right-sided clefts showed better symmetry \\n      than left-sided clefts for Millard (p<.001). This was reversed for Pigott\\n      (P=.0121). There was a difference (P<.001) between the symmetry of the two cleft \\n      cohorts and the non-cleft children (asymmetry 19.9%), and between Millard\\'s\\n      outcomes following different lip surgical protocols (P < .0001), but no\\n      difference between Pigott\\'s outcomes using different palate surgical protocols (P\\n      = 0.59). Conclusions: Cleft lip repair by Millard and Pigott resulted in similar \\n      lip asymmetry (37% and 39% symmetry mismatch, respectively). Lip surgical\\n      protocol and cleft side may affect lip asymmetry. Palate surgery did not affect\\n      lip asymmetry. Following cleft surgery, children were more asymmetric than\\n      non-cleft children.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.\\nFAU - Maggiulli, F\\nAU  - Maggiulli F\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Plastic Surgery, Competence Centre for Cleft Lip and\\n      Palate CHU University Hospital Lapeyronie 371 Av. du Doyen Gaston Giraud, 34090\\n      Montpellier, France.\\nFAU - Hinton, C\\nAU  - Hinton C\\nAD  - West Midlands Cleft Lip and Palate Service, Birmingham Children\\'s Hospital NHS\\n      Foundation Trust,, Steelhouse Lane, Birmingham, B4 6NH, UK.\\nFAU - Simpson, L\\nAU  - Simpson L\\nAD  - West Midlands Cleft Lip and Palate Service, Birmingham Children\\'s Hospital NHS\\n      Foundation Trust,, Steelhouse Lane, Birmingham, B4 6NH, UK.\\nFAU - Gujral, S\\nAU  - Gujral S\\nAD  - Department of Plastic Surgery, Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, Barrack\\n      Road, Exeter, EX2 5DW, UK.\\nFAU - Hardwicke, J\\nAU  - Hardwicke J\\nAD  - Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital Coventry, Clifford Bridge\\n      road, Coventry CV2 2DX, UK.\\nFAU - Slator, R\\nAU  - Slator R\\nAD  - West Midlands Cleft Lip and Palate Service, Birmingham Children\\'s Hospital NHS\\n      Foundation Trust,, Steelhouse Lane, Birmingham, B4 6NH, UK.\\nFAU - Pigott, R W\\nAU  - Pigott RW\\nAD  - Deceased, 17th February 2020, former cleft surgeon, Department of Plastic\\n      Surgery, Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, BS16 1LE, UK.\\nFAU - Su, T L\\nAU  - Su TL\\nAD  - Division of Dentistry, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine\\n      and Health, University of Manchester, UK.\\nFAU - Richard, B\\nAU  - Richard B\\nAD  - West Midlands Cleft Lip and Palate Service, Birmingham Children\\'s Hospital NHS\\n      Foundation Trust,, Steelhouse Lane, Birmingham, B4 6NH, UK.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220617\\nPL  - Netherlands\\nTA  - JPRAS Open\\nJT  - JPRAS open\\nJID - 101680420\\nPMC - PMC9343930\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Cleft lip and palate\\nOT  - Millard\\nOT  - Pigott\\nOT  - Symnose\\nOT  - facial aesthetic outcomes\\nCOIS- The authors state no conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:18\\nPHST- 2022/03/02 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/05/17 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:18 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1016/j.jpra.2022.05.012 [doi]\\nAID - S2352-5878(22)00044-4 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - JPRAS Open. 2022 Jun 17;33:145-154. doi: 10.1016/j.jpra.2022.05.012. eCollection \\n      2022 Sep.\\n\\nPMID- 35928806\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2666-5484 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2666-5484 (Linking)\\nVI  - 11\\nDP  - 2022 Sep\\nTI  - Evaluation of the National Institutes of Health-supported relative citation ratio\\n      among American orthopedic spine surgery faculty: A new bibliometric measure of\\n      scientific influence.\\nPG  - 100143\\nLID - 10.1016/j.xnsj.2022.100143 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Publication metrics have been traditionally used to compare research \\n      productivity amongst academic faculty. However, traditional bibliometrics lack\\n      field-normalization and are often biased towards time-dependent publication\\n      factors. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a new,\\n      field-normalized, article-level metric, known as the \"relative citation ratio\"\\n      (RCR), that can be used to make accurate self, departmental, and cross-specialty \\n      comparisons of research productivity. This study evaluates the use of the RCR\\n      amongst academic orthopedic spine surgery faculty and analyzes physician factors \\n      associated with RCR values. Methods: A retrospective data analysis was performed \\n      using the iCite database for all fellowship trained orthopedic spine surgery\\n      (OSS) faculty associated with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical\\n      Education (ACGME)-accredited orthopedic surgery residency program. Mean RCR,\\n      weighted RCR, and total publication count were compared by sex, career duration, \\n      academic rank, and presence of additional degrees. A value of 1.0 is the\\n      NIH-funded field-normalized standard. Student t-tests were used for two-group\\n      analyses whereas the analysis of variance tests (ANOVA) was used for\\n      between-group comparisons of three or more subgroups. Statistical significance\\n      was achieved at P < 0.05. Results: A total of 502 academic OSS faculty members\\n      from 159 institutions were included in the analysis. Overall, OSS faculty were\\n      highly productive, with a median RCR of 1.62 (IQR 1.38-2.32) and a median\\n      weighted RCR of 68.98 (IQR 21.06-212.70). Advancing academic rank was associated \\n      with weighted RCR, career longevity was associated with mean RCR score, and male \\n      sex was associated with having increased mean and weighted RCR scores.

Yet, attributes of the bicycle\\n      riding experience and riding differences between adults and children and males\\n      and females are not well documented. Most existing data on bicycling trip\\n      characteristics are based on self-reported interviews or surveys, which are prone\\n      to recall bias. The purpose of this exploratory study was to capture naturalistic\\n      bicycling data to examine trip characteristics and compare exposure\\n      classification accuracy between GPS and video data. We enrolled 10 children and\\n      10 adults and captured their bicycling trips for one week each using PedalPortal,\\n      a GPS-enabled helmet camera data capture and coding system developed by the\\n      authors and a team of engineering students. Overall, 261 trips, 57 hours, and 670\\n      miles of bicycling were captured. The video data allowed for correct\\n      classification of riding location (sidewalk, bicycle lane, street, etc.), an\\n      advantage over GPS data alone. Child trips were significantly shorter in both\\n      time and distance than adult trips (p<0.01). The majority of male trips were\\n      commutes (69.8% child, 60.5% adult), while female trips were more evenly\\n      distributed among commute, non-commute utilitarian, and recreation. Adults\\n      primarily chose paved streets with no bicycle facilities, but also sought out\\n      on-road bicycle facilities (bike lanes and shared lane markings). Children rode\\n      most frequently on sidewalks. Results from this study demonstrate that the\\n      addition of video data can improve classification of bicycling exposure and\\n      differences by age and gender that can help planners and engineers better\\n      understand bicyclist behavior variations and increase safety by selecting\\n      appropriate and targeted countermeasures.\\nFAU - Hamann, Cara J\\nAU  - Hamann CJ\\nAD  - University of Iowa College of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, 145 N.\\n      Riverside Drive, S449 CPHB, Iowa City, IA, USA.\\nAD  - University of Iowa Injury Prevention Research Center, 200 Newton Rd, Iowa City,\\n      IA, USA.\\nFAU - Peek-Asa, Corinne\\nAU  - Peek-Asa C\\nAD  - Injury Prevention Research Center, University of Iowa College of Public Health,\\n      145 N Riverside Dr, S160 CPHB, Iowa City, IA, USA.\\nAD  - University of Iowa Injury Prevention Research Center, 200 Newton Rd, Iowa City,\\n      IA, USA.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - Netherlands\\nTA  - J Transp Health\\nJT  - Journal of transport & health\\nJID - 101633121\\nPMC - PMC9348609\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - bicyclist behaviour\\nOT  - children\\nOT  - naturalistic\\nOT  - traffic safety\\nOT  - vulnerable road users\\nEDAT- 2017/03/01 00:00\\nMHDA- 2017/03/01 00:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:18\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:18 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2017/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2017/03/01 00:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1016/j.jth.2016.11.006 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - J Transp Health. 2017 Mar;4:363-372. doi: 10.1016/j.jth.2016.11.006.\\n\\nPMID- 35928803\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1792-1082 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1792-1074 (Linking)\\nVI  - 24\\nIP  - 2\\nDP  - 2022 Aug\\nTI  - miR-29b-3p inhibits 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell proliferation through the\\n      YWHAE/BCL-2 regulatory axis.\\nPG  - 289\\nLID - 10.3892/ol.2022.13409 [doi]\\nAB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumours in the world\\n      and seriously affects health of men. Studies have shown that microRNA\\n      (miR)-29b-3p and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation\\n      protein epsilon (YWHAE) play important roles in influencing the proliferation and\\n      apoptosis of PCa cells. However, the molecular mechanism of miR-29b-3p and YWHAE \\n      in the proliferation and apoptosis of PCa cells remains unclear. In the present\\n      study, bioinformatics as well as in vivo and in vitro experiments were used to\\n      predict and verify the targeting relationship between YWHAE and mir-29B-3p and\\n      investigate the potential roles of YWHAE and mir-29b-3p in the proliferation and \\n      apoptosis of 22RV1 cells. Using bioinformatics and a double luciferase system\\n      assay, it was confirmed that miR-29b-3p can target YWHAE 3\\'untranslated region\\n      and affect the expression of YWHAE, suggesting that miR-29b-3p may be a potential\\n      miRNA of YWHAE. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, Cell Counting Kit-8,\\n      Transwell and cell scratch assays showed that miR-29b-3p significantly inhibited \\n      the proliferation, invasion and migration of 22Rv1 cells (P<0.01). Rescue\\n      experiments demonstrated that YWHAE gene introduction reversed the inhibitory\\n      effect of miR-29b-3p on 22Rv1 cells. Western blotting revealed that the\\n      upregulation of miR-29b-3p inhibited YWHAE expression, resulting in a very\\n      significant decrease in the ratio of p-BAD/BAD and full-length caspase 3/cleaved \\n      caspase 3 (P<0.01) and an extremely significant increase in the ratio of\\n      BAX/BCL-2 (P<0.01). A tumourigenesis test in nude mice in vivo confirmed that the\\n      upregulation of miR-29b-3p inhibited tumour growth by targeting YWHAE. The\\n      present experiments confirmed that miR-29b-3p plays a tumour suppressor role in\\n      22Rv1 PCa cells, and the YWHAE/BCL-2 regulatory axis plays a vital role in\\n      miR-29b-3p regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of 22Rv1 cells.

However,\\n      more than 80% of referred diagnostic cases of hemiplegic migraine (HM) are\\n      negative for exonic mutations in these known FHM genes, suggesting the\\n      involvement of other genes. Using whole-exome sequencing data from 187\\n      mutation-negative HM cases, we identified rare variants in the CACNA1I gene\\n      encoding the T-type calcium channel Cav3.3. Burden testing of CACNA1I variants\\n      showed a statistically significant increase in allelic burden in the HM case\\n      group compared to gnomAD (OR = 2.30, P = 0.00005) and the UK Biobank (OR = 2.32, \\n      P = 0.0004) databases. Dysfunction in T-type calcium channels, including Cav3.3, \\n      has been implicated in a range of neurological conditions, suggesting a potential\\n      role in HM. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we compared the biophysical\\n      properties of five Cav3.3 variants (p.R111G, p.M128L, p.D302G, p.R307H, and\\n      p.Q1158H) to wild-type (WT) channels expressed in HEK293T cells. We observed\\n      numerous functional alterations across the channels with Cav3.3-Q1158H showing\\n      the greatest differences compared to WT channels, including reduced current\\n      density, right-shifted voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and\\n      slower current kinetics. Interestingly, we also found significant differences in \\n      the conductance properties exhibited by the Cav3.3-R307H and -Q1158H variants\\n      compared to WT channels under conditions of acidosis and alkalosis. In light of\\n      these data, we suggest that rare variants in CACNA1I may contribute to HM\\n      etiology.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Maksemous, Blayney, Sutherland, Smith, Lea, Tran, Ibrahim,\\n      McArthur, Haupt, Cader, Finol-Urdaneta, Adams and Griffiths.\\nFAU - Maksemous, Neven\\nAU  - Maksemous N\\nAD  - Genomics Research Centre, The Centre for Genomics and Personalised Health, School\\n      of Biomedical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD,\\n      Australia.\\nFAU - Blayney, Claire D\\nAU  - Blayney CD\\nAD  - Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute, University of Wollongong,\\n      Wollongong, NSW, Australia.\\nFAU - Sutherland, Heidi G\\nAU  - Sutherland HG\\nAD  - Genomics Research Centre, The Centre for Genomics and Personalised Health, School\\n      of Biomedical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD,\\n      Australia.\\nFAU - Smith, Robert A\\nAU  - Smith RA\\nAD  - Genomics Research Centre, The Centre for Genomics and Personalised Health, School\\n      of Biomedical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD,\\n      Australia.\\nFAU - Lea, Rod A\\nAU  - Lea RA\\nAD  - Genomics Research Centre, The Centre for Genomics and Personalised Health, School\\n      of Biomedical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD,\\n      Australia.\\nFAU - Tran, Kim Ngan\\nAU  - Tran KN\\nAD  - Genomics Research Centre, The Centre for Genomics and Personalised Health, School\\n      of Biomedical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD,\\n      Australia.\\nFAU - Ibrahim, Omar\\nAU  - Ibrahim O\\nAD  - Genomics Research Centre, The Centre for Genomics and Personalised Health, School\\n      of Biomedical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD,\\n      Australia.\\nFAU - McArthur, Jeffrey R\\nAU  - McArthur JR\\nAD  - Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute, University of Wollongong,\\n      Wollongong, NSW, Australia.\\nFAU - Haupt, Larisa M\\nAU  - Haupt LM\\nAD  - Genomics Research Centre, The Centre for Genomics and Personalised Health, School\\n      of Biomedical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD,\\n      Australia.\\nFAU - Cader, M Zameel\\nAU  - Cader MZ\\nAD  - Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United \\n      Kingdom.\\nFAU - Finol-Urdaneta, Rocio K\\nAU  - Finol-Urdaneta RK\\nAD  - Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute, University of Wollongong,\\n      Wollongong, NSW, Australia.\\nFAU - Adams, David J\\nAU  - Adams DJ\\nAD  - Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute, University of Wollongong,\\n      Wollongong, NSW, Australia.\\nFAU - Griffiths, Lyn R\\nAU  - Griffiths LR\\nAD  - Genomics Research Centre, The Centre for Genomics and Personalised Health, School\\n      of Biomedical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD,\\n      Australia.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Mol Neurosci\\nJT  - Frontiers in molecular neuroscience\\nJID - 101477914\\nPMC - PMC9345121\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - CACNA1I\\nOT  - Cav3.3\\nOT  - T-type calcium channels\\nOT  - familial hemiplegic migraine\\nOT  - hemiplegic migraine\\nOT  - ion channel\\nOT  - migraine genetics\\nOT  - voltage gated calcium channels\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:17\\nPHST- 2022/03/09 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/13 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:17 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fnmol.2022.892820 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Mol Neurosci. 2022 Jul 19;15:892820. doi: 10.3389/fnmol.2022.892820.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928782\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1664-0640 (Print)\\nIS  - 1664-0640 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Early Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Combined With\\n      Sertraline in Adolescents With First-Episode Major Depressive Disorder.\\nPG  - 853961\\nLID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.853961 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Adolescence is a period of high incidence for depression.

The depressive symptom and\\n      cognitive function were assessed by the Hamilton depression rating scale 17\\n      version (HAMD-17), Children\\'s Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R),\\n      Integrated visual and auditory continuous performance test (IVA-CPT), and\\n      THINC-it. Results: The number of early improvers after 2 weeks of treatment in\\n      the study group was statistically significant higher compared to the control\\n      group (95.83% vs 73.47%, chi(2) = 9.277, P = 0.002). There was significant\\n      difference observed in responder rates (62.50% vs. 28.57%, chi(2) = 11.262, P =\\n      0.001) or in remission rates (31.25% vs. 6.12%, chi(2) = 10.130, P = 0.001)\\n      between the two groups at 4 weeks. The score of HAMD-17 and CDRS-R in the study\\n      group were significantly lower than the control group (Fgroup = 12.91 vs 10.21, P\\n      < 0.05). Attention Quotient (listening, visual and full-scale) attention quotient\\n      of IVA-CPT in the study group were higher than those in the control group after\\n      treatment, and the differences were statistically significant(P < 0.05). The\\n      study group showed higher score in Spotter than the control group after treatment\\n      (P < 0.05). Discussion: This is the most extensive blinded, randomized clinical\\n      study to date examining the efficacy of 10-Hz add-on rTMS for first-onset\\n      adolescent depression. Our results support that add-on rTMS accelerates the\\n      efficacy of the antidepressants, improving the depressive symptoms and cold\\n      cognitive function in first-episode adolescent depression.

522\\nLID - 10.21037/atm-22-1187 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Serum bilirubin may play a role in preventing antioxidant and\\n      cytoprotective effects in physiological conditions. Serum bilirubin levels are\\n      inversely correlated with insulin resistance and the prevalence of cardiovascular\\n      diseases and diabetes mellitus. However, the correlation between serum bilirubin \\n      and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unclear. NAFLD in non-obese\\n      participants may lead to serious health problems, calling for prompt recognition \\n      and early management. This study aimed at investigating the relationship between \\n      the serum bilirubin levels and NAFLD in non-obese Chinese adults. Methods: We\\n      evaluated 4,900 non-obese subjects (body mass index <25 kg/m(2)) residing in\\n      Wuwei, China. The subjects received a baseline questionnaire, physical\\n      examination, abdominal ultrasonography, and laboratory check-ups. Fasting serum\\n      bilirubin was measured with an automated biochemical analyzer. NAFLD was\\n      diagnosed based on imaging findings of fatty liver disease on ultrasonography,\\n      without excessive alcohol intake and other known causes for chronic liver\\n      disease. A logistic regression model was applied to calculate the association\\n      between serum bilirubin level and NAFLD in non-obese subjects. Results: NAFLD was\\n      diagnosed in 408 (203 men) of the subjects, and they had a mean age of\\n      51-year-old. Non-obese NAFLD patients had lower serum direct bilirubin (DBIL)\\n      levels than control group did [2.50 (1.80-3.25) vs. 2.60 (1.90-3.50), P=0.004],\\n      but no significant differences in indirect bilirubin (IBIL) and total bilirubin\\n      (TBIL) levels of the two groups was seen (both P>0.05). After adjusting\\n      confounding factors such as age, gender, body mass index, blood glucose, and\\n      blood lipids, multivariate analysis showed serum DBIL (OR: 0.96, 95% CI:\\n      0.83-1.11, P trend =0.6022), IBIL (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.89-1.17, P trend =0.7756),\\n      and TBIL (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.87-1.15, P trend =0.991) levels were not associated\\n      with NAFLD in the non-obese population. In addition, subgroup analyses\\n      (stratified according to age, gender, and medical histories of hypertension, and \\n      diabetes mellitus) suggested no independent association between NAFLD and DBIL,\\n      IBIL, or TBIL. Conclusions: Our data suggest that serum bilirubin levels are\\n      unlikely to be associated with NAFLD in non-obese subjects.\\nCI  - 2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Various CAR-T cell constructs used in different types of DSCs result in\\n      heterogeneous responses. Thus, we aimed to systematically summarize the clinical \\n      response of DSCs treated with CAR-T cells and investigate factors associated with\\n      heterogeneity in outcomes. Methods: Clinical studies of DSC patients treated with\\n      CAR-T cell therapy were selected from the PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of\\n      Science databases before October 1, 2020. \"CAR-T cell\", \"solid tumor\" and their\\n      synonymous terms were used to construct the search strategy. Duplicates, reviews,\\n      non-English literature, articles not related to clinical studies or CAR-T cells\\n      used for digestive tumors were excluded. The included studies were assessed by\\n      the Institute of Health Economics (IHE) risk of bias tool to check the\\n      methodological quality. The inverse variance method was used to perform data\\n      pooling and subgroup analysis to clarify the causes of heterogeneity. Publication\\n      bias was examined by funnel plots and Egger\\'s test. Results: Twelve studies were \\n      included, and the risk of bias evaluation was demonstrated as plots using Review \\n      Manager 5.3. The pooled overall response rate (ORR) was 2% (95% CI: 0-6%), and\\n      the clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 42% (95% CI: 24-61%). According to subgroup\\n      analysis, costimulation (P=0.0449), lymphodepletion (P=0.0002), persistence of\\n      CAR-T cells (P=0.0443) and transduction method (P=0.0165) were factors\\n      contributing to heterogeneity. For adverse effects, pyrexia was the most frequent\\n      (35%, 95% CI: 24-61%). No publication bias was found, and the major results were \\n      robust within a slight fluctuation for each removal of one of the 12 studies.\\n      Discussion: CAR-T cell therapy is generally beneficial for patients with DSCs\\n      though the ORR was still poor. Modified construction with more specific tumor\\n      antigens, costimulatory domain and lentiviral vectors is necessary to obtain a\\n      better antitumor response of CAR-T cell therapy. Information of survival data are\\n      needed for a more comprehensive analysis.\\nCI  - 2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Radiographic diagnostic methods \\n      remain ineffective during early healing, resulting in average nonunion diagnosis \\n      times surpassing six months. To address this clinical deficit, we developed a\\n      novel diagnostic device to predict fracture healing outcome by noninvasive\\n      telemetric measurements of fracture bending stiffness. This study evaluated the\\n      hypothesis that our diagnostic antenna system is capable of accurately measuring \\n      temporal fracture healing stiffness, and advises the utility of this data for\\n      expedited prediction of healing outcomes during early (</=3 weeks) fracture\\n      recovery. Methods: Fracture repair was simulated, in reverse chronology, by\\n      progressively destabilizing cadaveric ovine metatarsals (n=8) stabilized via\\n      locking plate fixation. Bending stiffness of each fracture state were predicted\\n      using a novel direct electromagnetic coupling diagnostic system, and results were\\n      compared to values from material testing (MT) methods. While direct calculation\\n      of fracture stiffness in a simplistic cadaver model is possible, comparable\\n      analysis of the innumerable permutations of fracture and treatment type is not\\n      feasible. Thus, clinical feasibility of direct electromagnetic coupling was\\n      explored by parametric finite element (FE) analyses (n=1,632 simulations).\\n      Implant mechanics were simulated throughout the course of healing for cases with \\n      variations to fracture size, implant type, implant structure, and implant\\n      material. Results: For all fracture states, stiffness values predicted by the\\n      direct electromagnetic coupling system were not significantly different than\\n      those quantified by in vitro MT methods [P=0.587, P=0.985, P=0.975; for comparing\\n      intact, destabilized, and fully fractured (FF) states; respectively]. In\\n      comparable models, the total implant deflection reduction (from FF to intact\\n      states) was less than 10% different between direct electromagnetic coupling\\n      measurements (82.2 microm) and FE predictions (74.7 microm). For all treatment\\n      parameters, FE analyses predicted nonlinear reduction in bending induced implant \\n      midspan deflections for increasing callus stiffness. Conclusions: This technology\\n      demonstrates potential as a noninvasive clinical tool to accurately quantify\\n      healing fracture stiffness to augment and expedite healing outcome predictions\\n      made using radiographic imaging.\\nCI  - 2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

We evaluated whether HU-CPR improved\\n      survival and surrogate outcomes as compared to standard CPR (S-CPR). Methods:\\n      Studies reporting on HU-CPR in SCA were searched for in PubMed, Embase and\\n      Cochrane Library from inception to May 1st 2021. Outcomes included\\n      neurologically-intact survival, 24-hour-survival, intracranial pressure (ICP),\\n      cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP) and brain blood flow (BBF). Risk of bias was \\n      assessed using the GRADE assessment tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Fixed- and\\n      random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled effects of HU-CPR at 30\\n      degrees. Results: Thirteen articles met the criteria for inclusion (11\\n      animal-only studies, one before-and-after human-only study, one study that\\n      utilized human- and animal-cadavers). Among animal studies, the most common\\n      implementation of HU-CPR was a 30-degree upward tilt of the head and thorax\\n      (n=7), while four studies investigated controlled sequential elevation (CSE). Two\\n      animal studies reported improved cerebral performance category (CPC) scores at\\n      24-hour. The pooled effect on 24-hour survival was not statistically significant \\n      (P=0.37). The lone human study reported doubled return of spontaneous circulation\\n      (ROSC) (17.9% versus 34.2%, P<0.0001). The pooled effect on ROSC in three porcine\\n      studies was OR =3.63 (95% CI: 0.72-18.39). Pooled effects for surrogate\\n      physiological outcomes of intracranial cranial pressure (MD -14.08, 95% CI:\\n      -23.21 to -4.95, P=0.003), CerPP (MD 14.39, 95% CI: 3.07-25.72, P=0.01) and BBF\\n      (MD 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02-0.27, P=0.03), showed statistically significant benefit.\\n      Discussion: Overall, HU-CPR improved neurologically-intact survival at 24-hour,\\n      ROSC and physiological surrogate outcomes in animal models. Despite promising\\n      preclinical data, and one human observational study, clinical equipoise remains\\n      surrounding the role of HU-CPR in SCA, necessitating clarification with future\\n      randomized human trials.\\nCI  - 2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Patients were assigned to 2 groups based \\n      on reconstruction and fixation components used on the medial column. The medial\\n      column of participants in the control group (n=20) was anchored using screws. The\\n      medial column for subjects in the treatment group (n=20) was reconstructed using \\n      a one-third tubular steel plate. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society \\n      (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after operation,\\n      intraoperative blood loss, fracture healing time, preoperative detumescence\\n      duration, operation time, postoperative weightbearing duration, and postoperative\\n      Burwell-Charnley radiological score of the 2 groups were compared. Results: The\\n      findings showed that intraoperative blood loss, preoperative detumescence time,\\n      and operation time for the treatment group were not statistically different\\n      relative to the control group (P>0.05). The fracture healing time and\\n      postoperative weightbearing time in the treatment group were 15.07+/-0.98 weeks\\n      and 6.91+/-0.61 weeks, respectively, while those in the control group were\\n      15.84+/-0.59 weeks and 8.60+/-0.53 weeks, respectively (P<0.05). Patients in the \\n      treatment group showed markedly higher AOFAS scores relative to the AOFAS scores \\n      of subjects in the control group at month 1, 2, and 3 post-operation (P<0.05).\\n      AOFAS scores for the 2 groups were not significantly different at month 6, 12 and\\n      24 post-operation. Subjects in the control group had a significantly lower\\n      Burwell-Charnley number radiology score relative to that of subjects in the\\n      treatment group (P<0.05). Conclusions: The present findings show that the medial \\n      column of subjects with Ruedi-Allgower type III pilon fracture can be repaired\\n      using a one-third tubular steel plate. Compared with simple screw fixation, the\\n      use of a one-third tubular steel plate allows earlier postoperative\\n      weightbearing, decreases the rate of postoperative reduction loss, and leads to\\n      better clinical effects and prognosis.\\nCI  - 2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Consequently, we aimed to develop a reliable tool for prognostic\\n      estimation of HCC. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and\\n      adjacent normal tissues in 3 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were\\n      identified, followed by hub gene selection and least absolute shrinkage and\\n      selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression to develop a prognostic gene signature.\\n      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox regression,\\n      time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), and integrated value of time-dependent\\n      AUC (iAUC) were used to assess the relationship between predictors and clinical\\n      outcomes in the training and validation datasets. Then we built nomograms\\n      including gene signature and clinicopathological factors to forecast the\\n      probability of death. Moreover, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to\\n      compare the expression of prognostic genes between HCC and adjacent normal\\n      tissues. Finally, the relationship between prognostic genes and tumor\\n      microenvironment (TME) was investigated using immune cell infiltration algorithms\\n      and single cell transcriptomic database. Results: Eight prognostic genes (CDC20, \\n      PTTG1, TOP2A, CXCL2, CXCL14, CYP2C9, MT1F, and GHR) were finally identified to\\n      construct the gene signature. Each patient\\'s risk score was calculated according \\n      to the gene signature. Patients with high-risk scores showed worse outcomes in\\n      the training set [hazard ratio (HR) =3.404, P<0.001]. Risk score, age, body mass \\n      index (BMI), and TNM stage were identified as independent prognostic factors for \\n      overall survival (OS) in the training set. The nomogram including risk score and \\n      other independent prognostic factors showed better performance as opposed to the \\n      clinicopathological model. In the validation dataset, we obtained the similar\\n      results as well. Moreover, we found a close relationship between risk score and\\n      immune cell infiltration. Patients with high-risk scores had elevated expression \\n      of immune checkpoint genes, indicating that these patients may be more suitable\\n      for immunotherapy. Conclusions: We have established and validated an eight-gene\\n      based prognostic model, which could be an effective tool for the prognostic\\n      evaluation of HCC patients.\\nCI  - 2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

The combined\\n      model showed good discrimination performance in the validation cohort [area under\\n      the curve (AUC) =0.844] and outperformed the clinical (AUC =0.696) and radiomics \\n      (AUC =0.767) model alone (both P<0.05). Conclusions: The clinical radiomic\\n      nomogram can serve as a promising predictive tool for IFI in patients with\\n      hematologic malignancies.\\nCI  - 2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Therefore, identifying the risk factors for \\n      postoperative complications and oncological outcome after salvage surgery is\\n      important. This study aimed to determine which HPSCC patients might benefit from \\n      salvage surgery following previous radiotherapy. Methods: We retrospectively\\n      analyzed 91 HPSCC patients who underwent salvage surgery due to locoregional\\n      recurrence/residual disease after radiotherapy. The pre- and intraoperative\\n      characteristics with complications and oncological outcomes were collected\\n      through medical records and telephone follow-up. Risk factors for complications\\n      were analyzed by binary logistic regression. The oncological outcomes were\\n      assessed by overall survival (OS) after salvage surgery. Kaplan-Meier curves and \\n      Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were used for univariate and\\n      multivariate survival analyses. Results: Postoperative complications occurred in \\n      40.7% of patients, with pharyngo-cutaneous fistula (PCF) occurring in 29.7% of\\n      patients. Salvage surgery for local disease was the only independent risk factor \\n      for postoperative complications and PCF [complications: odds ratio (OR) =5.298,\\n      95% confidence interval (CI): 1.163-24.130, P=0.031; PCF: OR =4.543, 95% CI:\\n      1.187-17.387, P=0.027). In the subgroup of patients with local disease, time of\\n      curative treatment initiation >90 days (OR =7.331, 95% CI: 1.278-42.054, P=0.025)\\n      and preoperative hemoglobin <118 g/L (OR =10.101, 95% CI: 1.026-99.492, P=0.045) \\n      were independent risk factors for postoperative complications, while free flap\\n      reconstruction was an independent protective factor for PCF (OR =0.099, 95% CI:\\n      0.010-0.934, P=0.043). The median OS time was 17 months, with 5-year OS rates of \\n      30%. Age at salvage surgery <50 years [hazard ratio (HR) =2.047, 95% CI:\\n      1.217-3.443, P=0.007] and recurrence or retreatment clinical T stage 3-4 (rcT3-4)\\n      (HR =2.051, 95% CI: 1.219-3.450, P=0.007) were identified as risk factors for OS.\\n      The 5-year OS rates of patients without and with both risk factors were 43% and\\n      10% (P=0.001). Conclusions: Salvage surgery for locoregional recurrence/residual \\n      disease after previous radiotherapy could improve survival in selected patients\\n      with HPSCC. Patients with local recurrence/residual disease had a higher\\n      complication rate. Efforts can be made to shorten the time of curative treatment \\n      initiation and treat anemia to reduce the risk of postoperative complications in \\n      this subgroup.\\nCI  - 2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

There is a pressing need for research into\\n      potential genetic markers to help drug development and improve the prognosis of\\n      patients. SLC2A1 has been reported in multiple LUAD-related prognosis prediction \\n      signatures. However, the role of SLC2A1 in the occurrence and development of LUAD\\n      and its impact on prognosis remain elusive. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas\\n      (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to acquire the samples. We\\n      used R to perform statistical analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA),\\n      immune infiltration and immune cell correlation analysis, drug sensitivity\\n      analysis, and visualization. The immune cell score was calculated using the\\n      Timer2.0 database. Prognostic analysis was performed using R, Gene Expression\\n      Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and the Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Overall\\n      survival and progression free survival were the main outcome of prognosis\\n      analysis. Protein-protein interaction, disease-genetics analysis, and\\n      tissue-specific enrichment analyses were performed using Metascape. Results:\\n      SLC2A1 was highly expressed in LUAD tissues. Univariate COX regression [hazard\\n      ratio (HR) =1.689, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.242-2.249, P<0.001] and\\n      multivariate COX regression including age, gender, smoking, TNM stage and SLC2A1 \\n      expression (HR =1.567, 95% CI: 1.127-2.179, P=0.008) showed that SLC2A1 was an\\n      independent prognostic risk factor for LUAD. GSEA and Metascape analysis showed\\n      that SLC2A1 was strongly associated with the cell cycle, mitosis, lung tissue,\\n      and tumor recurrence. Immune correlation analysis showed that SLC2A1 was\\n      associated with two tumor infiltration immune cells: activated CD (cluster of\\n      differentiation)4(+) memory T cells (r=0.31, P=0.003) and activated mast cells\\n      (r=-0.28, P=0.010). Moreover, patients with high SLC2A1 expression had higher\\n      immune checkpoint molecules and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE)\\n      scores, indicating poorer immunotherapy efficacy. Patients with high SLC2A1\\n      expression were more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs and less sensitive to\\n      targeted drugs compared to those with low SLC2A1 expression. Conclusions: The\\n      high expression of SLC2A1 in LUAD predicted poor prognosis and was closely\\n      related to tumor immunity, which could be used as an effective prognostic\\n      biomarker to provide a new strategy for clinical prognosis assessment and\\n      immunotherapy for LUAD.\\nCI  - 2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Results: A total of 401 Wed + Lob\\n      cases were matched with 255 Lob cases according to their propensity scores.\\n      Although no significant differences were found in OS, multivariate analysis\\n      showed that patients with T1N0M0 NSCLC in the Wed + Lob group had significantly\\n      improved DFS (HR =0.583; P=0.012) compared to those in the Lob group. After\\n      surgery, a decrease in FR+ CTCs was observed in 21 of 23 patients (91.3%) in the \\n      Wed + Lob group and in 16 of 23 patients (69.6%) in the Lob group [mean changes: \\n      6.10 (+/-7.80) FU per 3 mL vs. 1.31 (+/-4.39) FU per 3 mL; P=0.014]. Conclusions:\\n      Wed + Lob may improve DFS and reduce tumor cell dissemination in patients with\\n      T1N0M0 NSCLC.\\nCI  - 2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) is a new method that helps \\n      identify PTGs. This study aimed to determine whether short-term experience with\\n      intraoperative NIRAF may influence postoperative complications after\\n      thyroidectomy. Materials and methods: Overall, 65 patients who underwent\\n      thyroidectomy by one high-volume surgeon were enrolled in the study between March\\n      2018 and August 2021. In August 2020, the surgeon performed four operations using\\n      the NIRAF device. After that experience, the technique of operating and\\n      preserving PTGs has been totally changed. Postoperative serum calcium (Ca) and\\n      parathormone (PTH) concentrations were measured. Using retrospective study\\n      analysis, we assessed the rate of PH and HPT. Results: There was no statistically\\n      significant difference in Ca (p = 0.1612) and PTH (p = 0.3590) concentrations\\n      between groups operated on before and after the NIRAF experience. The serum\\n      concentrations of Ca and PTH of all patients were positively correlated (r =\\n      0.4074; p = 0.0022) as well as the Ca concentration and age of patients (r =\\n      0.3292; p = 0.0116), respectively. Conclusions: These findings suggest that\\n      short-term NIRAF experience, and changing attitude to preserving PTGs does not\\n      affect thyroidectomy outcomes, even when utilized by a highly experienced\\n      high-volume thyroid surgeon. However, continuous use of NIRAF might enhance\\n      treatment outcomes, particularly for surgeons with limited experience.\\nCI  - (c) The author(s).\\nFAU - Domoslawski, Pawel\\nAU  - Domoslawski P\\nAD  - Department of General, Minimally Invasive and Endocrine Surgery, Wroclaw Medical \\n      University, Wroclaw, Poland.\\nFAU - Adamiecki, Marcin\\nAU  - Adamiecki M\\nAD  - Department of Orthopedic, Oncological and Reconstructive Surgery, Medical\\n      University of Silesia, Regional Hospital, Sosnowiec, Poland.\\nFAU - Antkowiak, Lukasz\\nAU  - Antkowiak L\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice,\\n      Poland.\\nFAU - Pasko, Krzysztof\\nAU  - Pasko K\\nAD  - Department of General and Endoscopic Surgery, EMC Euromedicare Hospital Wroclaw, \\n      Wroclaw, Poland.\\nFAU - Chabowski, Mariusz\\nAU  - Chabowski M\\nAD  - Department of Surgery, 4th Military Teaching Hospital, 50-981 Wroclaw, Poland.\\nAD  - Division of Anesthesiologic and Surgical Nursing, Department of Nursing and\\n      Obstetrics, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.\\nFAU - Grzegrzolka, Jedrzej\\nAU  - Grzegrzolka J\\nAD  - Department of Histology and Embryology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw,\\n      Poland.\\nFAU - Zrabkowski, Michal\\nAU  - Zrabkowski M\\nAD  - Department of General, Minimally Invasive and Endocrine Surgery, Wroclaw Medical \\n      University, Wroclaw, Poland.\\nFAU - Bialecki, Jacek\\nAU  - Bialecki J\\nAD  - Department of General, Minimally Invasive and Trauma Surgery, Franciszek Raszeja \\n      Memorial Hospital, Poznan, Poland.\\nFAU - Antkowiak, Ryszard\\nAU  - Antkowiak R\\nAD  - Department of General and Vascular Surgery, 3rd Provincial Hospital, Rybnik,\\n      Poland.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220718\\nPL  - Australia\\nTA  - Int J Med Sci\\nJT  - International journal of medical sciences\\nJID - 101213954\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9346384\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - fluobeam\\nOT  - high-volume surgeon\\nOT  - near-infrared autofluorescence\\nOT  - thyroidectomy\\nCOIS- Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:16\\nPHST- 2022/03/15 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/16 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:16 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.7150/ijms.72886 [doi]\\nAID - ijmsv19p1334 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Int J Med Sci. 2022 Jul 18;19(8):1334-1339. doi: 10.7150/ijms.72886. eCollection \\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928715\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1449-1907 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1449-1907 (Linking)\\nVI  - 19\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - MALAT1 Polymorphisms and Lung Cancer Susceptibility in a Chinese Northeast Han\\n      Population.\\nPG  - 1300-1306\\nLID - 10.7150/ijms.73026 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: LncRNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript\\n      1) was competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) involved in various molecular processes\\n      for metastasis development in lung cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)\\n      in MALAT1 gene might be predictive markers for lung cancer. In our study, we\\n      selected rs619586 and rs3200401 in MALAT1 gene to explore their effects on lung\\n      cancer susceptibility. Methods: The case-control study included 444 lung cancer\\n      cases and 460 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed by Taqman allelic\\n      discrimination method. Logistic regression, Student t-test, and Chi-square test\\n      (chi(2) ) were used to analyze the data. Results: The findings of the study\\n      showed that rs3200401 was significantly associated with the risk of non-small\\n      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Compared with\\n      homozygous CC genotype, CT heterozygous genotype decreased risk of NSCLC (P(a) = \\n      0.034) and LUSC (P(a) = 0.025).

Toward understanding the\\n      molecular basis of the rn1 mutant phenotypes, we conducted tandem mass tag\\n      (TMT)-labeling proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses of the root tissues of\\n      the rn1 mutant and progenitor T322 line to identify potential proteins involved\\n      in manifestation of the mutant phenotype. We identified 3,160 proteins. When the \\n      p-value was set at </=0.05 and the fold change of protein accumulation between\\n      rn1 and T322 at >/=1.5 or </=0.67, we detected 118 proteins that showed increased\\n      levels and 32 proteins decreased levels in rn1 as compared to that in T322. The\\n      differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) are involved in several pathways\\n      including cellular processes for processing environmental and genetic\\n      information, metabolism and organismal systems. Five pathogenesis-related\\n      proteins were accumulated to higher levels in the mutant as compared to that in\\n      T322. Several of the DAPs are involved in hormone signaling, redox reaction,\\n      signal transduction, and cell wall modification processes activated in\\n      plant-pathogen interactions. The phosphoproteomics analysis identified 22\\n      phosphopeptides, the levels of phosphorylation of which were significantly\\n      different between rn1 and T322 lines. The phosphorylation levels of two type II\\n      metacaspases were reduced in rn1 as compared to T322. Type II metacaspase has\\n      been shown to be a negative regulator of hypersensitive cell death. In absence of\\n      the functional Rn1 protein, two type II metacaspases exhibited reduced\\n      phosphorylation levels and failed to show negative regulatory cell death function\\n      in the soybean rn1 mutant. We hypothesize that Rn1 directly or indirectly\\n      phosphorylates type II metacaspases to negatively regulate the cell death process\\n      in soybean roots.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Wang, Das, Pal, Bhawal, Zhang and Bhattacharyya.\\nFAU - Wang, Feifei\\nAU  - Wang F\\nAD  - Department of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.\\nFAU - Das, Priyanka\\nAU  - Das P\\nAD  - Department of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.\\nFAU - Pal, Narinder\\nAU  - Pal N\\nAD  - Department of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.\\nFAU - Bhawal, Ruchika\\nAU  - Bhawal R\\nAD  - Proteomics and Metabolomics Facility, Institute of Biotechnology, Cornell\\n      University, Ithaca, NY, United States.\\nFAU - Zhang, Sheng\\nAU  - Zhang S\\nAD  - Proteomics and Metabolomics Facility, Institute of Biotechnology, Cornell\\n      University, Ithaca, NY, United States.\\nFAU - Bhattacharyya, Madan K\\nAU  - Bhattacharyya MK\\nAD  - Department of Agronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, United States.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Plant Sci\\nJT  - Frontiers in plant science\\nJID - 101568200\\nPMC - PMC9344878\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - cell death\\nOT  - metacaspases\\nOT  - phosphoproteomics\\nOT  - proteomics\\nOT  - root necrosis\\nOT  - soybean\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:16\\nPHST- 2022/02/23 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/05/17 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:16 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.882561 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Plant Sci. 2022 Jul 19;13:882561. doi: 10.3389/fpls.2022.882561.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928705\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1664-462X (Print)\\nIS  - 1664-462X (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Two-Phase Conceptual Framework of Phosphatase Activity and Phosphorus\\n      Bioavailability.\\nPG  - 935829\\nLID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.935829 [doi]\\nAB  - The activity of extracellular phosphatases is a dynamic process controlled by\\n      both plant roots and microorganisms, which is responsible for the mineralization \\n      of soil phosphorus (P). Plants regulate the availability of soil P through the\\n      release of root mucilage and the exudation of low-molecular weight organic acids \\n      (LMWOAs). Mucilage increases soil hydraulic conductivity as well as pore\\n      connectivity, both of which are associated with increased phosphatase activity.\\n      The LMWOAs, in turn, stimulate the mineralization of soil P through their\\n      synergistic effects of acidification, chelation, and exchange reactions. This\\n      article reviews the catalytic properties of extracellular phosphatases and their \\n      interactions with the rhizosphere interfaces. We observed a biphasic effect of\\n      root metabolic products on extracellular phosphatases, which notably altered\\n      their catalytic mechanism. In accordance with the proposed conceptual framework, \\n      soil P is acquired by both plants and microorganisms in a coupled manner that is \\n      characterized by the exudation of their metabolic products. Due to inactive or\\n      reduced root exudation, plants recycle P through adsorption on the soil matrix,\\n      thereby reducing the rhizosphere phosphatase activity. The two-phase conceptual\\n      framework might assist in understanding P-acquisition (substrate turnover) and\\n      P-restoration (phosphatase adsorption by soil) in various terrestrial ecosystems.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Manzoor, Dippold, Loeppmann and Blagodatskaya.\\nFAU - Manzoor, Aamir\\nAU  - Manzoor A\\nAD  - Biogeochemistry of Agroecosystems, University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.\\nFAU - Dippold, Michaela A\\nAU  - Dippold MA\\nAD  - Geo-Biosphere Interactions, Department of Geosciences, University of Tuebingen,\\n      Tuebingen, Germany.\\nFAU - Loeppmann, Sebastian\\nAU  - Loeppmann S\\nAD  - Biogeochemistry of Agroecosystems, University of Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.\\nAD  - Institute of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science, Christian-Albrechts University,\\n      Kiel, Germany.\\nFAU - Blagodatskaya, Evgenia\\nAU  - Blagodatskaya E\\nAD  - Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Halle (Saale), Germany.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Review\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Plant Sci\\nJT  - Frontiers in plant science\\nJID - 101568200\\nPMC - PMC9343760\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - LMWOAs\\nOT  - mucilage\\nOT  - phosphatase adsorption\\nOT  - phosphatase-soil interactions\\nOT  - root exudation\\nOT  - substrate catalysis\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:16\\nPHST- 2022/05/04 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/15 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:16 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.935829 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Plant Sci. 2022 Jul 19;13:935829. doi: 10.3389/fpls.2022.935829.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928697\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2397-9070 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2397-9070 (Linking)\\nVI  - 6\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022 Aug\\nTI  - Relationship between active Helicobacter pylori infection and anemia, iron\\n      deficiency, iron deficiency anemia: A cross-sectional study in a sub-Saharan\\n      setting.\\nPG  - 554-568\\nLID - 10.1002/jgh3.12787 [doi]\\nAB  - Background and Aim: There have been contradictory reports about the association\\n      between Helicobacter pylori infection and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Based on \\n      the high frequency of H. pylori infection in Cameroon, we have evaluated the\\n      frequency of H. pylori infection as the cause of anemia, and IDA among dyspeptic \\n      patients in Cameroon. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 842 dyspeptic \\n      patients (472 women and 370 men) in two reference hospitals in Douala-Cameroon.\\n      Each participant gave a written consent, and the study was approved by the\\n      National Ethical Committee. Erythroid-related indices and markers of iron\\n      deficiency (ID) measurement were done for each participant as well as H. pylori\\n      detection. Data were analyzed using SSPS statistical package. Results: The\\n      prevalence of anemia, ID, IDA, and H. pylori infection was 65.08%, 31.47%,\\n      25.65%, and 80.88%, respectively. H. pylori infected individuals had a\\n      significantly lower mean value of hemoglobin (P = 0.01), hematocrit (P = 0.04),\\n      ferritin (P = 0.03) and coefficient of transferrin saturation (CTS) levels (P =\\n      0.04) and a significantly higher mean value of mean corpuscular hemoglobin\\n      concentration (MCHC) (P = 0.02). Compared with H. pylori non-infected\\n      participants, H. pylori infected patients were 1.2938 (95% confidence interval\\n      [CI]: 0.9087-1.8421), 1.1851 (95% CI: 0.8122-1.7292), and 1.5636 (95% CI:\\n      1.0206-2.3953) times at higher risk to develop anemia, ID, and IDA, respectively.\\n      A significant relationship was found between H. pylori infection and IDA (P =\\n      0.04 and 0.04 for crude and age/sex-adjusted, respectively). Conclusion: H.\\n      pylori infection seems to be associated with anemia, and IDA among dyspeptic\\n      patients in our milieu.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

Anion exchange resins have been reported to be effective in\\n      patients with bile acid diarrhea after distal ileectomy; furthermore, bile acid\\n      metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of CD. Therefore, we aimed to \\n      examine the effectiveness of colestimide in the management of postoperative CD,\\n      and to compare its impact between patients with and those without ileocecal\\n      resection. Methods: Postoperative CD patients prescribed colestimide for diarrhea\\n      between April 2017 and December 2020 were retrospectively evaluated for changes\\n      in the total Crohn\\'s disease activity index (CDAI), each CDAI component including\\n      diarrhea frequency/week, albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was evaluated\\n      before and after the administration of colestimide. Furthermore, comprehensive\\n      patient and physician assessments were reviewed from medical records during the\\n      first outpatient visit as a global clinical judgment after the initiation of\\n      colestimide therapy. Results: A total of 24 patients were included, of whom 17\\n      had a previous history of ileocecal resection. Significant improvement was noted \\n      in CDAI and diarrhea frequency only in the ileocecal resection group (CDAI: 114.5\\n      +/- 52.7 and 95.4 +/- 34.8, P < 0.05; diarrhea frequency/week 23.8 +/- 14.1 and\\n      15.4 +/- 11.2, P < 0.05, respectively). There was no significant improvement in\\n      other CDAI components, albumin level, or CRP level in either group. In the global\\n      clinical judgment, 13 and 4 patients in the ileocecal and non-ileocecal resection\\n      groups, respectively, were judged as \"effective,\" with an overall efficacy rate\\n      of 70.8%. Conclusion: Colestimide is effective for diarrhea in patients with\\n      postoperative CD, especially after ileocecal resection.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

Nonetheless, with improved treatment, the\\n      prognosis of PBC also improves. QOL plays an important role in patients with PBC.\\n      In this study, we aimed to reevaluate the transition of new symptom development\\n      in PBC and its predictive factors. Methods: This retrospective multicenter study \\n      enrolled 382 patients with PBC for symptom analysis. The impact of a newly\\n      developed symptom on PBC prognosis was investigated by Kaplan-Meier analysis with\\n      propensity score matching and logistic progression analysis. Results: The\\n      cumulative risk of developing a new symptom after 10 and 20 years of follow-up\\n      was 7.6 and 28.2%, and specifically that of pruritus, which was the most common\\n      symptom, was 6.7 and 23.3%, respectively. In Cox hazard risk analysis, serum Alb \\n      level (hazard ratio [HR], 1.097; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.033-1.165; P =\\n      0.002), the serum D-Bil level (HR, 6.262; 95% CI, 2.522-15.553, P < 0.001), and\\n      Paris II criteria (HR, 0.435; 95% CI, 0.183-1.036; P = 0.037) were significant\\n      independent predictors of a new symptom. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the\\n      overall survival and liver-related death were not significant between patients\\n      with and without a new symptom. Conclusion: The cumulative risk of new symptom\\n      development is roughly 30% 20 years after diagnosis and could be predicted by\\n      factors including serum albumin levels, serum D-Bil level, and Paris II criteria.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.

The HPS-2 subtype is distinguished by neutropenia, and little is\\n      known about its periodontal phenotype in adolescents. AP3B1 is the causative gene\\n      for HPS-2. A 13-year-old Chinese girl presented to our department suffering from \\n      gingival bleeding and tooth mobility. Her dental history was otherwise\\n      unremarkable. Suspecting some systemic diseases as the underlying cause, the\\n      patient was referred for medical consultation, a series of blood tests, and\\n      genetic tests. In this case study, periodontal status and mutation screening of\\n      one HPS-2 case are presented. Methods: Blood analysis including a complete blood \\n      count (CBC) and glycated hemoglobin levels were measured. Platelet transmission\\n      electron microscopy (PTEM) was performed to observe the dense granules in\\n      platelets. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing were performed to\\n      confirm the pathogenic variants. Results: A medical diagnosis of HPS-2 was\\n      assigned to the patient. Following the medical diagnosis, a periodontal diagnosis\\n      of \"periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease\" was assigned to the\\n      patient. We identified novel compound heterozygous variants in AP3B1\\n      (NM_003664.4: exon7: c.763C>T: p.Q255(*)) and (NM_003664.4: exon1: c.53_56dup:\\n      p.E19Dfs(*)21) in this Chinese pedigree with HPS-2. Conclusion: This case study\\n      indicates the importance of periodontitis as a possible indicator of underlying\\n      systemic disease. Systemic disease screening is needed when a young patient\\n      presents with unusual, severe periodontitis, as the oral condition may be the\\n      first of a systemic abnormality. Our work also expands the spectrum of AP3B1\\n      mutations and further provides additional genetic testing information for other\\n      HPS-2 patients.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Chen, Yang, Liu, Xie and Li.\\nFAU - Chen, Jun\\nAU  - Chen J\\nAD  - Hunan Key Laboratory of Oral Health Research, Hunan 3D Printing Engineering\\n      Research Center of Oral Care, Hunan Clinical Research Center of Oral Major\\n      Diseases and Oral Health, Xiangya School of Stomatology, Central South\\n      University, Changsha, China.\\nAD  - Department of Periodontics, Xiangya Stomatological Hospital, Central South\\n      University, Changsha, China.\\nFAU - Yang, Yifan\\nAU  - Yang Y\\nAD  - Hunan Key Laboratory of Oral Health Research, Hunan 3D Printing Engineering\\n      Research Center of Oral Care, Hunan Clinical Research Center of Oral Major\\n      Diseases and Oral Health, Xiangya School of Stomatology, Central South\\n      University, Changsha, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Binjie\\nAU  - Liu B\\nAD  - Hunan Key Laboratory of Oral Health Research, Hunan 3D Printing Engineering\\n      Research Center of Oral Care, Hunan Clinical Research Center of Oral Major\\n      Diseases and Oral Health, Xiangya School of Stomatology, Central South\\n      University, Changsha, China.\\nAD  - Department of Periodontics, Xiangya Stomatological Hospital, Central South\\n      University, Changsha, China.\\nFAU - Xie, Xiaoli\\nAU  - Xie X\\nAD  - Hunan Key Laboratory of Oral Health Research, Hunan 3D Printing Engineering\\n      Research Center of Oral Care, Hunan Clinical Research Center of Oral Major\\n      Diseases and Oral Health, Xiangya School of Stomatology, Central South\\n      University, Changsha, China.\\nFAU - Li, Wenjie\\nAU  - Li W\\nAD  - Hunan Key Laboratory of Oral Health Research, Hunan 3D Printing Engineering\\n      Research Center of Oral Care, Hunan Clinical Research Center of Oral Major\\n      Diseases and Oral Health, Xiangya School of Stomatology, Central South\\n      University, Changsha, China.\\nAD  - Deparment of Orthodontics, Xiangya Stomatological Hospital, Central South\\n      University, Changsha, China.\\nAD  - Department of Oral Health Science, School of Dentistry, University of Washington,\\n      Seattle, WA, United States.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Pediatr\\nJT  - Frontiers in pediatrics\\nJID - 101615492\\nPMC - PMC9343695\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS-2)\\nOT  - adaptor protein complex 3 (AP3B1)\\nOT  - genetics\\nOT  - juvenile\\nOT  - periodontitis\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:15\\nPHST- 2022/04/22 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/23 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:15 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fped.2022.914243 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Pediatr. 2022 Jul 19;10:914243. doi: 10.3389/fped.2022.914243. eCollection \\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928682\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2296-2360 (Print)\\nIS  - 2296-2360 (Linking)\\nVI  - 10\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided bleomycin combined with dexamethasone in\\n      the treatment of pediatric lymphangiomas.\\nPG  - 935470\\nLID - 10.3389/fped.2022.935470 [doi]\\nAB  - Purpose: This work aimed to report our experience with ultrasound-guided\\n      instillation for the treatment of lymphangiomas in children, so as to determine\\n      whether the combined use of bleomycin and dexamethasone achieved a higher\\n      response rate and a lower side effect rate. Methods: The medical records from\\n      patients with lymphangiomas between January 1st, 2013 and September 31st, 2020,\\n      were reviewed. Patients who received bleomycin combined with dexamethasone\\n      sclerotherapy were classified as the dexamethasone group, while those receiving\\n      bleomycin without dexamethasone were classified as the control group. Results:\\n      Altogether one hundred and twenty-seven patients were diagnosed with\\n      lymphangiomas. Among them, one hundred and five patients received bleomycin\\n      combined with dexamethasone injection, while the remaining twenty-two received\\n      bleomycin injection alone. The excellent rates were 89.52% [95% confidence\\n      interval (CI), 81.64-94.40%] in the dexamethasone group and 72.73% (95% CI,\\n      52.51-92.94%) in the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the recurrence rates\\n      were 3.81% (95% CI, 1.22-10.03%) in the dexamethasone group and 13.64% (95% CI,\\n      3.6-36.0%) in the control group (p > 0.05). After comparison between the two\\n      groups, the following risk factors were identified. These include >10 sacs at the\\n      initial stage of diagnosis, larger size after all injections, and response to the\\n      first injection. Conclusions: Although there was no significant difference in the\\n      recurrence rate between the two groups, this retrospective study demonstrated\\n      that the excellent response rates were dramatically improved between the two\\n      groups, suggesting that bleomycin combined with DEX was an effective and highly\\n      safe treatment for all types of pediatric lymphangiomas. Moreover, this study\\n      also identified three novel features as the significant risk factors for\\n      recurrence.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Zhang, Zhang, Wang and Chang.\\nFAU - Zhang, Yu-Tong\\nAU  - Zhang YT\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Oncology, The First Hospital of Jilin University,\\n      Changchun, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Chao\\nAU  - Zhang C\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Oncology, The First Hospital of Jilin University,\\n      Changchun, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Yu\\nAU  - Wang Y\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Oncology, The First Hospital of Jilin University,\\n      Changchun, China.\\nFAU - Chang, Jian\\nAU  - Chang J\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Oncology, The First Hospital of Jilin University,\\n      Changchun, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Pediatr\\nJT  - Frontiers in pediatrics\\nJID - 101615492\\nPMC - PMC9343682\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - bleomycin\\nOT  - dexamethasone\\nOT  - lymphangiomas\\nOT  - pediatric\\nOT  - risk factors\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:15\\nPHST- 2022/05/04 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/27 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:15 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fped.2022.935470 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Pediatr. 2022 Jul 19;10:935470. doi: 10.3389/fped.2022.935470. eCollection \\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928681\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2296-2360 (Print)\\nIS  - 2296-2360 (Linking)\\nVI  - 10\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - TGF-beta1-Mediated Leukocyte Cell-Derived Chemotaxin 2 Is Associated With Liver\\n      Fibrosis in Biliary Atresia.\\nPG  - 901888\\nLID - 10.3389/fped.2022.901888 [doi]\\nAB  - Objective: Biliary atresia (BA) presents as a severe infantile cholangiopathy\\n      disease, characterized by progressive liver fibrosis and the resulting poor\\n      prognosis. Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) was proposed as the key\\n      gene associated with hepatic fibrosis in BA, but the molecular mechanism is\\n      unclear. This study aims to investigate the function of LECT2 in BA. Methods: A\\n      total of 53 patients were enrolled in this study; 36 patients with BA, and 17\\n      control patients with cholestasis, including congenital biliary dilations,\\n      biliary hypoplasia, and inspissated bile syndrome. The role of LECT2 in BA was\\n      analyzed using histological and cytological tests. The correlation between LECT2 \\n      and infiltrating immune cells was further analyzed by bioinformatics. The\\n      analyses were conducted using correlational analyses and ROC curves. Results:\\n      LECT2 was highly expressed in infants with BA and positively related with\\n      fibrosis (0.1644 +/- 0.0608 vs. 0.0779 +/- 0.0053, p < 0.0001; r s = 0.85, p <\\n      0.0001). Serum levels of LECT2 showed high distinguishing features for patients\\n      with BA having an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90-1.00). CD163 was highly expressed in \\n      the aggravation of fibrosis (0.158 +/- 0.062 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.078, p < 0.0001), and\\n      the expression of LECT2 was positively correlated with the accumulation of\\n      CD163(+) macrophages (r = 0.48, p = 0.003). The bioinformatic analysis also\\n      showed that LECT2 was positively correlated with macrophage M2 (r = 0.34, p =\\n      0.03). TGF-beta1 and CD163 colocalized to the portal area in the livers of\\n      patients with BA. Moreover, TGF-beta1 upregulated the expression of LECT2.\\n      Conclusion: LECT2 is highly expressed in both BA liver tissue and serum, and\\n      serum LECT2 is a potential diagnostic biomarker of BA. Meanwhile, TGF-beta1 is\\n      secreted by macrophages to regulate LECT2 associated with BA liver fibrosis.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Zhao, Xu, Gou, Zheng, Ge, Chen, Zhang, Ma, Lin, Hu and Zhan.\\nFAU - Zhao, Jinfeng\\nAU  - Zhao J\\nAD  - Graduate College, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Children\\'s Hospital, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Xu, Xiaodan\\nAU  - Xu X\\nAD  - Graduate College, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Children\\'s Hospital, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Gou, Qingyun\\nAU  - Gou Q\\nAD  - Graduate College, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Children\\'s Hospital, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Zheng, Qipeng\\nAU  - Zheng Q\\nAD  - Graduate College, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Children\\'s Hospital, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Ge, Liang\\nAU  - Ge L\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Children\\'s Hospital, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Lingzhi\\nAU  - Chen L\\nAD  - Graduate College, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Children\\'s Hospital, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Cong\\nAU  - Zhang C\\nAD  - Graduate College, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Children\\'s Hospital, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Ma, Hui\\nAU  - Ma H\\nAD  - Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tianjin Children\\'s Hospital, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Lin, Shuxiang\\nAU  - Lin S\\nAD  - Department of Pediatric Research Institute, Tianjin Children\\'s Hospital, Tianjin,\\n      China.\\nFAU - Hu, Xiaoli\\nAU  - Hu X\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Tianjin Children\\'s Hospital, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Zhan, Jianghua\\nAU  - Zhan J\\nAD  - Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Children\\'s Hospital, Tianjin, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220714\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Pediatr\\nJT  - Frontiers in pediatrics\\nJID - 101615492\\nPMC - PMC9345500\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - biliary atresia\\nOT  - diagnostics\\nOT  - inflammatory response\\nOT  - leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2\\nOT  - liver fibrosis\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:15\\nPHST- 2022/03/22 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/20 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:15 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fped.2022.901888 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Pediatr. 2022 Jul 14;10:901888. doi: 10.3389/fped.2022.901888. eCollection \\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928679\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2296-2360 (Print)\\nIS  - 2296-2360 (Linking)\\nVI  - 10\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Maternal Factors in Pregnancy and Ethnicity Influence Childhood Adiposity,\\n      Cardiac Structure, and Function.\\nPG  - 900404\\nLID - 10.3389/fped.2022.900404 [doi]\\nAB  - Importance: The links between maternal and offspring adiposity and metabolic\\n      status are well established. There is much less evidence for the impact of these \\n      relationships combined with ethnic background on cardiac structure and function\\n      in childhood. Objective: To test the hypothesis that ethnicity, maternal\\n      adiposity and glycemic status, and child adiposity affect cardiac structure and\\n      function. Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: A single-center\\n      mother-child cohort study. The cohort is a subset of the international\\n      multi-center Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study.\\n      Participants: This study included 101 healthy pre-pubertal British-born children \\n      [56 White Europeans (WEs) and 45 South Asians (SAs)] with a median age of 9.1\\n      years, range 6.0-12.2 years, at the time of the investigation. Main Outcomes and \\n      Measures: Anthropometric and echocardiographic measurements were made on the\\n      cohort. Maternal pregnancy and birth data were available. Relationships between\\n      maternal parameters (BMI and glucose status), child adiposity, and echo measures \\n      were assessed. Results: Despite no ethnic difference in BMI SDS at a median age\\n      of 9.1 years, SA children exhibited higher levels of body fat than WE children\\n      (whole body, right arm, and truncal fat all p < 0.001). SA children also\\n      exhibited greater changes in weight and height SDS but not BMI SDS from birth\\n      than WE children. As expected, maternal BMI correlated with child BMI (r = 0.28; \\n      p = 0.006), and body fat measures (e.g., whole body fat r = 0.25; p = 0.03).\\n      Maternal fasting glucose levels were associated with child body fat measures (r =\\n      0.22-0.28; p = 0.02-0.05). Left ventricular (LV) indices were not different\\n      between SA and WE children, but E/A and E\\'/A\\' (measures of diastolic function)\\n      were lower in SA when compared with WE children. LV indices correlated positively\\n      to BMI SDS and body fat markers only in SA children. Maternal fasting and 2-h\\n      glucose were negatively correlated with E\\'/A\\' in SA children (r = -0.53, p =\\n      0.015, and r = -0.49, p = 0.023, respectively) but not in WE children.

Growing evidence indicate that secondary maternal infections \\n      contribute to a much greater proportion of symptomatic cCMV than was previously\\n      thought. We performed a monocentric retrospective study of babies with cCMV\\n      evaluated from August 2004 to February 2021; we compared data of symptomatic\\n      children born to mothers with primary or secondary infection, both at birth and\\n      during follow up. Among the 145 babies with available data about maternal\\n      infection, 53 were classified as having symptomatic cCMV and were included in the\\n      study: 40 babies were born to mothers with primary infection and 13 babies were\\n      born to mothers with secondary infection. Analyzing data at birth, we found no\\n      statistical differences in the rate of clinical findings in the two groups,\\n      except for unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) which was significantly\\n      more frequent in patients born to mother with secondary infection than in those\\n      born to mother with primary infection (46.2 vs. 17.5%, P = 0.037). During follow \\n      up, we found a higher rate of many sequelae (tetraparesis, epilepsy, motor and\\n      speech delay, and unilateral SNHL) in the group of children born to mothers with \\n      secondary infection, with a statistical difference for tetraparesis and\\n      unilateral SNHL. Otherwise, only children born to mothers with primary infection \\n      presented bilateral SNHL both at birth and follow up. Our data suggest that the\\n      risk of symptomatic cCMV and long-term sequelae is similar in children born to\\n      mother with primary and secondary CMV infection; it is important to pay\\n      appropriate attention to seropositive mothers in order to prevent reinfection and\\n      to detect and possibly treat infected babies.\\nCI  -

1449-1456\\nLID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00655-y [doi]\\nAB  - Purpose: Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA)\\n      and total hip arthroplasty (THA) can be a devastating diagnosis. Debridement,\\n      antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) is a preferred treatment modality for\\n      acute PJI. A retrospective analysis of infected primary arthroplasties to\\n      evaluate the success of DAIR and factors influencing its outcomes. Methods: We\\n      retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent DAIR for PJI at our unit\\n      between 2010 and 2018. Patients who underwent revision surgery as an index\\n      procedure, arthroscopic washout and those with less than two years of follow-up\\n      were excluded. Treatment failure was defined as revision arthroplasty for\\n      recurrence of infection within 2 years of the index procedure. Chi-square and\\n      Fischer\\'s exact test were used to compare between patient factors and DAIR\\n      outcomes. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank test were used to analyse\\n      implant survivorship following DAIR. Results: Of the sixty patients (40 knees, 20\\n      hips) who underwent DAIR, eighteen (13 knees, 5 hips) required revision\\n      arthroplasty within 2 years accounting for a success rate of 70%. Predictive\\n      factors for revision were American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) score of\\n      greater than 2 (p = 0.021), BMI > 35 (p = 0.046), C Reactive protein (CRP) > 200 \\n      mg/L (p = 0.007) and Staphylococcus aureus growth (p = 0.012). The five-year\\n      survival rate for DAIR was 70%, which remained constant after two years from\\n      DAIR. Conclusion: Success rate of DAIR in PJI was 70% which was comparable to\\n      similar studies in the literature. ASA > 2, BMI > 35, CRP > 200 and\\n      staphylococcus aureus growth were predictors for DAIR failure. Implant survival\\n      rate and duration were better following DAIR in early-onset PJI.\\nCI  - (c) Crown 2022.\\nFAU - Walkay, Sriganesh\\nAU  - Walkay S\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, Golden Jubilee National Hospital, Clydebank, Glasgow,\\n      Scotland, UK.grid.413157.50000 0004 0590 2070\\nFAU - Wallace, David Tran\\nAU  - Wallace DT\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, Golden Jubilee National Hospital, Clydebank, Glasgow,\\n      Scotland, UK.grid.413157.50000 0004 0590 2070\\nFAU - Balasubramaniam, Vijay Shankar Coimbatore\\nAU  - Balasubramaniam VSC\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, Golden Jubilee National Hospital, Clydebank, Glasgow,\\n      Scotland, UK.grid.413157.50000 0004 0590 2070\\nFAU - Maheshwari, Rohit\\nAU  - Maheshwari R\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, Golden Jubilee National Hospital, Clydebank, Glasgow,\\n      Scotland, UK.grid.413157.50000 0004 0590 2070\\nFAU - Changulani, Manish\\nAU  - Changulani M\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, Golden Jubilee National Hospital, Clydebank, Glasgow,\\n      Scotland, UK.grid.413157.50000 0004 0590 2070\\nFAU - Sarungi, Martin\\nAU  - Sarungi M\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, Golden Jubilee National Hospital, Clydebank, Glasgow,\\n      Scotland, UK.grid.413157.50000 0004 0590 2070\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220528\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Indian J Orthop\\nJT  - Indian journal of orthopaedics\\nJID - 0137736\\nPMC - PMC9283628\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Arthroplasty\\nOT  - Debridement\\nOT  - Implant retention\\nOT  - Infection\\nCOIS- Conflict of InterestThe authors have no relevant financial or non-financial\\n      interests to disclose.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:15\\nPMCR- 2023/05/28 00:00\\nPHST- 2022/02/09 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/05/04 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2023/05/28 00:00 [pmc-release]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:15 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00655-y [doi]\\nAID - 655 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Indian J Orthop. 2022 May 28;56(8):1449-1456. doi: 10.1007/s43465-022-00655-y.\\n      eCollection 2022 Aug.\\n\\nPMID- 35928664\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 0019-5413 (Print)\\nIS  - 0019-5413 (Linking)\\nVI  - 56\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022 Aug\\nTI  - Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Transdermal Buprenorphine Patch and\\n      Conventional Analgesics in Intra-capsular Femur Neck Fracture Post\\n      Hemiarthroplasty.\\nPG  - 1363-1369\\nLID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00668-7 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: One of the most common fractures in the elderly population is a\\n      fracture of the neck of femur. Effective post-operative analgesia is a major\\n      challenge. Age-related co-morbidities restrict the choice of analgesics. The\\n      purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of transdermal\\n      buprenorphine [TDB] patch and conventional analgesics following hemiarthroplasty \\n      for intra-capsular fracture neck of femur. Materials and methods: This was a\\n      prospective, randomized control study done in 60 patients undergoing\\n      hemiarthroplasty for intra-capsular fracture neck of femur over a period of 2\\n      years. Patients were randomized in 2 groups. Group A received a combination of IV\\n      paracetamol and tramadol for first 48 h followed by oral formulation. In Group B \\n      patients, a transdermal buprenorphine patch of 5 mcg/h was applied at the\\n      beginning of surgery and was continued 2 weeks post-operative.Pain score by VAS\\n      was observed both at rest and on movement and followed up till 14 days\\n      post-operative. Primary target was to maintain a VAS </= 4. Rescue analgesic was \\n      given if the VAS was >/= 6. Secondary targets were number of rescue analgesics\\n      required, adverse reactions and complications if any. Results: Group B had\\n      significantly lower pain scores at rest and during movement [p value 0.0012 to\\n      </= 0.0001], so was rescue analgesia requirement. No significant side effects\\n      were seen in TDB group. Conclusion: TDB patch is safe and provides superior\\n      analgesia and compliance as compared to conventional analgesics in the\\n      post-operative period in proximal femur fracture surgeries.\\nCI  - (c) Indian Orthopaedics Association 2022.\\nFAU - Londhe, Sanjay Bhalchandra\\nAU  - Londhe SB\\nAD  - Holy Spirit Hospital, Mumbai, India.grid.460859.60000 0004 1805 5253\\nFAU - Patwardhan, Meghana\\nAU  - Patwardhan M\\nAD  - Criticare Superspeciality Hospital, Andheri, Mumbai, India.\\nFAU - Shah, Ravi Vinod\\nAU  - Shah RV\\nAD  - Criticare Superspeciality Hospital, Andheri, Mumbai, India.\\nFAU - Oak, Mugdha\\nAU  - Oak M\\nAD  - Criticare Superspeciality Hospital, Andheri, Mumbai, India.\\nFAU - Shah, Asit\\nAU  - Shah A\\nAD  - N J Englewood Orthopedic Associates, Paramus, NJ USA.\\nFAU - Antao, Nicholas\\nAU  - Antao N\\nAD  - Holy Spirit Hospital, Mumbai, India.grid.460859.60000 0004 1805 5253\\nFAU - Khot, Rahul\\nAU  - Khot R\\nAD  - Criticare Superspeciality Hospital, Andheri, Mumbai, India.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220625\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Indian J Orthop\\nJT  - Indian journal of orthopaedics\\nJID - 0137736\\nPMC - PMC9283632\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Conventional analgesics\\nOT  - Hemiarthroplasty\\nOT  - Post-operative\\nOT  - Proximal femur fracture\\nOT  - Transdermal buprenorphine patch\\nCOIS- Conflict of interestThe authors declare no financial conflicts of interest to\\n      disclose.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:15\\nPMCR- 2023/06/25 00:00\\nPHST- 2022/03/30 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/05/23 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2023/06/25 00:00 [pmc-release]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:15 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00668-7 [doi]\\nAID - 668 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Indian J Orthop. 2022 Jun 25;56(8):1363-1369. doi: 10.1007/s43465-022-00668-7.\\n      eCollection 2022 Aug.\\n\\nPMID- 35928660\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 0019-5413 (Print)\\nIS  - 0019-5413 (Linking)\\nVI  - 56\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022 Aug\\nTI  - The Dynamic Effect of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Deficiency on Patellar Height.\\nPG  - 1403-1409\\nLID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00632-5 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: The anterior tibial translation (ATT) in case of Anterior Cruciate\\n      Ligament (ACL) tear can lead to dynamic alterations of the extensor apparatus\\n      biomechanics. The aim of this study is to evaluate the dynamic effect of isolated\\n      ACL deficiency on patellar height. The hypothesis is that the ATT of\\n      ACL-insufficient knees dynamically reduces patellar height. Methods: Skeletally\\n      mature patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using hamstring graft between\\n      January and December 2018 were included in this study. The Posterior Tibial Slope\\n      (PTS), Caton-Deschamps (CDI), modified Insall-Salvati (MISI), and Blackburne-Peel\\n      (BPI) indices were calculated in standard lateral and TELOS X-rays. The mean of\\n      the measurements calculated between two observers was used to compare these\\n      parameters. Results: 95 patients (M: 57; F: 38; 95 knees) were included in the\\n      study with a mean age of 31.8 years (16-56 years old). Significant patellar\\n      height reduction (CDI: 0.11 [- 0.32; 0.31]; MISI: 0.09 [- 0.66; 0.30]) was\\n      reported in TELOS compared with standard lateral knee radiography (p < 0.001).\\n      20.0% of the study knees reported an abnormal CDI and 84.2% (16/19 knees) of them\\n      reduced this index to within normal limits in TELOS. 20.0% of the knees with mild\\n      patella alta reduced CDI in TELOS but always remained above 1.2. Conclusions: The\\n      abnormal ATT in case of ACL-deficient knees results in a lowering effect of the\\n      patella in TELOS X-rays. In patients with ACL tear and anterior pain the\\n      reconstructive ligament surgery should be performed to avoid also chronic\\n      anterior knee pain.

The secondary aim was to compare\\n      complication rates of Tension Band Wiring (TBW) and Plate Fixation (PF).\\n      Materials and Methods: Retrospective Study for all patients with surgically\\n      treated olecranon fractures from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2016 from a\\n      tertiary trauma center. Records review for demographic, injury characteristics,\\n      radiographic classification and configuration, implant choices and complications.\\n      Results grouped into three 4-year intervals, analyzed comparatively to establish \\n      significant trends over 12 years. Results: 262 patients were identified.\\n      Demographically, increasing mean age (48.7 to 58.9 years old, p value 0.004) and \\n      higher ASA scores (7.1% ASA 3 to 21.0% ASA 3 p value 0.001). Later fractures were\\n      more oblique (fracture angle 86.1-100.0 degrees, p value 0.001) and comminuted\\n      (Schatzker D type 10.4-30.0%, p value 0.025, single fracture line 94.0-66.0%, p\\n      value 0.001). Implant choice, sharp increase in PF compared to TBW (PF 16.0% to\\n      PF 80.2%, p value 0.001). Complication-wise, TBW had higher rates of symptomatic \\n      implant, implant and bony failures and implant removal. Conclusion: Demographic\\n      and fracture characteristic trends suggest that olecranon fractures are\\n      exhibiting fragility fracture characteristics (older age, higher ASA scores, more\\n      unstable, oblique and comminuted olecranon fractures). Having a high index of\\n      suspicion would alert surgeons to consider use of advanced imaging, utilize\\n      appropriate fixation techniques and manage the underlying osteoporosis for\\n      secondary fracture prevention. Despite this, trends suggest a potential\\n      overutilization of PF particularly for stable fracture patterns and the necessary\\n      precaution should be exercised.\\nCI  - (c) Indian Orthopaedics Association 2022.\\nFAU - Tan, Bryan Yijia\\nAU  - Tan BY\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-2794-703X\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Woodlands Health Campus, National Healthcare\\n      Group, 11 Jalan Tan Tock Seng, Singapore, 308433 Singapore.grid.466910.c0000 0004\\n      0451 6215\\nFAU - Ng, Jingwen\\nAU  - Ng J\\nAD  - Ministry of Health Holdings, Singapore, Singapore.grid.466910.c0000 0004 0451\\n      6215\\nFAU - Ng, Wei Xiang\\nAU  - Ng WX\\nAD  - Ministry of Health Holdings, Singapore, Singapore.grid.466910.c0000 0004 0451\\n      6215\\nFAU - Wei, Yuan\\nAU  - Wei Y\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Woodlands Health Campus, National Healthcare\\n      Group, 11 Jalan Tan Tock Seng, Singapore, 308433 Singapore.grid.466910.c0000 0004\\n      0451 6215\\nFAU - Kwek, Ernest Beng Kee\\nAU  - Kwek EBK\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Woodlands Health Campus, National Healthcare\\n      Group, 11 Jalan Tan Tock Seng, Singapore, 308433 Singapore.grid.466910.c0000 0004\\n      0451 6215\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220517\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Indian J Orthop\\nJT  - Indian journal of orthopaedics\\nJID - 0137736\\nPMC - PMC9283595\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Evolution\\nOT  - Fragility fracture\\nOT  - Olecranon fracture\\nOT  - Osteoporosis\\nOT  - Plate fixation\\nOT  - Tension band wiring\\nCOIS- Conflict of InterestAll authors certify that they have no affiliations with or\\n      involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest or\\n      non-financial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed in this\\n      manuscript.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:15\\nPMCR- 2023/05/17 00:00\\nPHST- 2022/01/12 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/04/14 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2023/05/17 00:00 [pmc-release]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:15 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00646-z [doi]\\nAID - 646 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Indian J Orthop. 2022 May 17;56(8):1385-1393. doi: 10.1007/s43465-022-00646-z.\\n      eCollection 2022 Aug.\\n\\nPMID- 35928651\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 0019-5413 (Print)\\nIS  - 0019-5413 (Linking)\\nVI  - 56\\nIP  - 8\\nDP  - 2022 Aug\\nTI  - Ellipsoidal Process of the Femoral Head in Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Effect of \\n      Prophylactic Hemiepiphysiodesis.\\nPG  - 1431-1438\\nLID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00662-z [doi]\\nAB  - Purpose: Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) often causes the residual deformity,\\n      typically appearing as an ellipsoidal shape. In some cases, this ovalization is\\n      related to the asymmetric growth of the femoral head physis, which presents a\\n      growth-inhibiting necrotic area in the anterosuperior quadrant. The objective of \\n      the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of selective\\n      hemiepiphysiodesis of the healthy physis in the posteroinferior quadrant as a\\n      means of disrupting femoral head ovalization in cases of LCPD with the previous\\n      onset of ovalization. Methods: We performed a prospective study of 39 LCPD hips\\n      operated on consecutively by selective hemiepiphysiodesis of the posteroinferior \\n      portion of the head during the reossification phase.Surgical indication was based\\n      on a progressive increase in the ellipsoidal index (EI), the presence of a double\\n      epiphyseal nucleus of reossification, physeal narrowing, and physeal angulation. \\n      Hemiepiphysiodesis was performed at the mean patient age of 8.8 years (SD 1.5)\\n      and a mean of 4.7 years (SD 1.4) following disease onset. Results: Preoperative\\n      EI was 1.80 (SD 0.2), which was reduced to 1.72 (SD 0.2) postoperatively (P >\\n      0.05). Physeal angulation increased from 50 degrees preoperatively (SD 9.3) to\\n      54.29 degrees (SD 9.7) at the end of growth (P > 0.05). The final result\\n      according to the Stulberg classification revealed 20 class-II cases, 16 class\\n      III, and 3 class IV, and SDS was 25.97 (SD 9.95), range: 9.36-51.67. Conclusion: \\n      As revealed by the EI, the ellipsoidal process may be stopped by selective\\n      hemiepiphysiodesis in the posteroinferior quadrant of the femoral head.

The outcomes of open reduction and internal fixation are poor\\n      in fractures with more than three fragments, and the excision of radial head is\\n      considered a viable surgical treatment option. However, it is associated with its\\n      own set of complications. The radial head prosthetic replacement has emerged as\\n      an alternative in management of these fractures with constraints of cost and\\n      related complications. Hence, the treatment for the unrepairable comminuted\\n      radial head fractures still remains controversial. Aims and Objectives: This\\n      systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare the post-operative\\n      outcomes of the radial head excision versus prosthetic replacement in comminuted \\n      Mason type-III fractures of radial head. Methodology: Three databases of Medline \\n      (PubMed), Scopus, and Embase were searched for comparative studies on the study\\n      question and relevant studies which mentioned at least one of the outcomes of\\n      interest (functional outcome scores and number of complications) were included.\\n      Results: Six studies were part of this review with 82 excisions and 99 prosthetic\\n      replacements. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms\\n      of number of complications (OR 0.65; 0.08-5.07); and measures of functional\\n      outcomes; Mayo elbow performance score or MEPS (mean difference - 6.56; - 23.45\\n      to 10.33). The incidence of elbow osteoarthritis, heterotrophic ossification,\\n      stiffness, and instability were similar in both groups. The flexion extension arc\\n      in degrees was better in excision group (mean difference 9.93; 1.31-18.55; p =\\n      .02). Conclusion: Excision is a reasonable surgical option for isolated\\n      comminuted radial head fractures with similar results of function and associated \\n      rates of complications as prosthetic replacements. The arc of motion is also\\n      better with excisions. There have been reports of more osteoarthritis with\\n      excision and arthroplasty has been advised in younger patients; however, we had\\n      no quantitative proof of that in this review.\\nCI  - (c) Indian Orthopaedics Association 2022.\\nFAU - Kumar, Prasoon\\nAU  - Kumar P\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0179-547X\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767\\n      2903\\nFAU - Jindal, Karan\\nAU  - Jindal K\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767\\n      2903\\nFAU - Rajnish, Rajesh Kumar\\nAU  - Rajnish RK\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-2080-2612\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, Adesh Medical College and Hospital, Shahabad,\\n      Kurukshetra, Haryana 136135 India.\\nFAU - Patel, Sandeep\\nAU  - Patel S\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767\\n      2903\\nFAU - Sharma, Siddhartha\\nAU  - Sharma S\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767\\n      2903\\nFAU - Kumar, Vishal\\nAU  - Kumar V\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767\\n      2903\\nFAU - Aggarwal, Sameer\\nAU  - Aggarwal S\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedics, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.grid.415131.30000 0004 1767\\n      2903\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPT  - Review\\nDEP - 20220620\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Indian J Orthop\\nJT  - Indian journal of orthopaedics\\nJID - 0137736\\nPMC - PMC9283616\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Excisions\\nOT  - MEPS\\nOT  - Mason type-III\\nOT  - Radial head fractures\\nOT  - Radial head prosthetic replacement\\nCOIS- Conflict of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:15\\nPMCR- 2023/06/20 00:00\\nPHST- 2021/12/05 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/04/12 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2023/06/20 00:00 [pmc-release]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:15 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00645-0 [doi]\\nAID - 645 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Indian J Orthop. 2022 Jun 20;56(8):1305-1315. doi: 10.1007/s43465-022-00645-0.\\n      eCollection 2022 Aug.\\n\\nPMID- 35928647\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2229-3485 (Print)\\nIS  - 2229-3485 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nIP  - 3\\nDP  - 2022 Jul-Sep\\nTI  - Effects of antihypertensive agents on the quality of life in diabetic\\n      hypertensive patients: A prospective study.\\nPG  - 137-144\\nLID - 10.4103/picr.PICR_15_20 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic noncommunicable disease, and\\n      hypertension (HT) is the most common comorbidity which affects their quality of\\n      life (QoL). Aim: The aim of the study was to assess the effects of\\n      antihypertensive agents (viz., amlodipine, ramipril, telmisartan, and ramipril\\n      with telmisartan) on the blood pressure (BP) and QoL. Methodology: It was an\\n      open-labeled prospective intention-to-treat study done in diabetic hypertensive\\n      patients (CTRI/2016/10/007340). Patients were randomly assigned antihypertensive \\n      agents, namely, amlodipine, ramipril, telmisartan, and a combination of ramipril \\n      with telmisartan (RT) in four groups. They were evaluated for BP, blood sugar\\n      level, and QoL at baseline and 24(th) week. Results: After 24 weeks of therapy,\\n      systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were significantly reduced in all\\n      groups. In amlodipine, there was a mean percentage fall of SBP by 15.85%\\n      (confidence interval [CI]: 21.38-28.13) and DBP by 11.22% (CI: 8.41-12.70); in\\n      ramipril - 14.4% (CI: 18.61-25.15) and 12.4% (CI 8.88-13.99); telmisartan - 18.4%\\n      (CI: 24.89-10.79) and 14.6% (CI 10.79-16.24); and in RT group, SBP 17.7% (CI:\\n      23.38-29.18) and DBP 12.4% (CI: 9.05-13.02). QoL score increased by 30.56% (CI:\\n      14.30-10.90), 30.94% (CI: 14.21-10.68), 28.07% (CI: 14.89-11.20), and 28.84% (CI:\\n      15.49-11.77), in respective groups (P < 0.0001, each). However, they were\\n      nonsignificant between the study groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Amlodipine,\\n      ramipril, telmisartan, and a combination of RT are equally effective to improve\\n      BP and QoL among diabetic hypertensive patients. However, amlodipine and\\n      telmisartan lacked in dry cough and more tolerable than the ramipril and RT\\n      therapy. Henceforth, amlodipine and telmisartan are better choice to control HT\\n      among DM patients.\\nCI  - Copyright: (c) 2021 Perspectives in Clinical Research.\\nFAU - Bhardwaj, Raj Kumar\\nAU  - Bhardwaj RK\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, GGS Medical College and Hospital, Baba Farid\\n      University of Health Sciences, Faridkot, India.\\nFAU - Kazal, H L\\nAU  - Kazal HL\\nAD  - Department of Medicine, PIMS, Jalandhar, India.\\nFAU - Kohli, Kamlesh\\nAU  - Kohli K\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, GGS Medical College and Hospital, Baba Farid\\n      University of Health Sciences, Faridkot, India.\\nFAU - Raj, Rajnish\\nAU  - Raj R\\nAD  - Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College, Patiala, Punjab, India.\\nFAU - Bansal, Nagma\\nAU  - Bansal N\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacology, GGS Medical College and Hospital, Baba Farid\\n      University of Health Sciences, Faridkot, India.\\nFAU - Singh, Baltej\\nAU  - Singh B\\nAD  - Department of Community Medicine, GGS Medical College and Hospital, Baba Farid\\n      University of Health Sciences, Faridkot, India.\\nFAU - Arora, Hobinder\\nAU  - Arora H\\nAD  - Department of Community Medicine, GGS Medical College and Hospital, Baba Farid\\n      University of Health Sciences, Faridkot, India.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20210108\\nPL  - India\\nTA  - Perspect Clin Res\\nJT  - Perspectives in clinical research\\nJID - 101551517\\nPMC - PMC9345252\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Amlodipine\\nOT  - Quality of Life Instrument in Diabetes Patients\\nOT  - blood pressure\\nOT  - ramipril\\nOT  - telmisartan\\nCOIS- There are no conflicts of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:15\\nPHST- 2020/01/21 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2020/08/13 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2020/08/17 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:15 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.4103/picr.PICR_15_20 [doi]\\nAID - PCR-13-137 [pii]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Perspect Clin Res. 2022 Jul-Sep;13(3):137-144. doi: 10.4103/picr.PICR_15_20.

Methods: The case data\\n      of 138 patients with acute cerebral infarction admitted to our hospital from\\n      February 2019 to February 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the\\n      treatment plan they received, patients were assigned to two groups, namely, an\\n      observation group (n = 71) treated with bridging therapy and a control group (n =\\n      67) treated with intravenous thrombolysis alone. The following indexes were\\n      recorded and compared between the two groups: treatment efficacy, National\\n      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, activities of daily living,\\n      incidence rates of vascular recanalization, intracranial hemorrhage and\\n      reembolization after treatment, levels of inflammatory factors before and after\\n      treatment, levels of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time\\n      (APTT) and fibrinogen (FIB) before and 1 week after treatment, and modified\\n      Rankin Scale scores 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Results: Compared with\\n      the control group, the therapeutic efficacy, neurological function, activities of\\n      daily living, and vascular recanalization were markedly better in the observation\\n      group (P > 0.05). In addition, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and\\n      reembolization was statistically lower in the observation group (P < 0.05). No\\n      marked difference was found between the two groups in terms of pretreatment serum\\n      inflammatory factors and coagulation function (P > 0.05), while the above\\n      indicators improved statistically after treatment in both groups, with\\n      comparatively more obvious improvement in the observation group. It was also\\n      observed that, compared with the control group, the modified Rankin Scale score\\n      in the observation group was significantly better at 3 and 6 months after\\n      treatment (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Bridging therapy can improve the vascular\\n      recanalization rate among patients suffering from acute cerebral infarction,\\n      reduce the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and reembolization, and improve\\n      the prognosis and neurological function of patients, which is worthy of clinical \\n      application.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Junting Huo et al.\\nFAU - Huo, Junting\\nAU  - Huo J\\nAUID- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2193-7404\\nAD  - Department of Neurology, Beijing Chuiyangliu Hospital, Beijing 100022, China.\\nFAU - Li, Wei\\nAU  - Li W\\nAD  - Department of Neurology, Beijing Chuiyangliu Hospital, Beijing 100022, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Yu\\nAU  - Liu Y\\nAD  - Department of Neurology, Beijing Chuiyangliu Hospital, Beijing 100022, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220726\\nPL  - Egypt\\nTA  - J Immunol Res\\nJT  - Journal of immunology research\\nJID - 101627166\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9345711\\nCOIS- The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the\\n      publication of this paper.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:15\\nPHST- 2022/03/10 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/05/12 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/06/13 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:15 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1155/2022/8295212 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - J Immunol Res. 2022 Jul 26;2022:8295212. doi: 10.1155/2022/8295212. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928627\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2072-1439 (Print)\\nIS  - 2072-1439 (Linking)\\nVI  - 14\\nIP  - 7\\nDP  - 2022 Jul\\nTI  - Association between comorbid cardiomyopathy and composite endpoints of patients\\n      with congestive heart failure in the intensive care unit: a retrospective cohort \\n      study.\\nPG  - 2665-2676\\nLID - 10.21037/jtd-22-833 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Congestive heart failure (HF) is a common condition in the intensive \\n      care unit (ICU). Cardiomyopathy is an important etiological factor in HF.\\n      However, few studies have explored the effect of cardiomyopathy on the prognosis \\n      of HF. This study explored the association between comorbid cardiomyopathy and\\n      the outcomes of critically ill patients with congestive HF. Methods: A\\n      retrospective cohort study was performed using data extracted from Medical\\n      Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All adult patients\\n      with the first ICU admission were enrolled as participants but those diagnosed\\n      with cardiomyopathy alone were excluded. The demographics, comorbidities, vital\\n      signs, laboratory tests, scoring systems, and treatments of patients were\\n      extracted to further analyze. The composite endpoints included in-hospital\\n      mortality, cardiac arrest, and re-admission to the ICU. The association between\\n      cardiomyopathy comorbidity and the composite endpoints was assessed using\\n      propensity-score matching (PSM) and multivariable logistic regression models.\\n      Results: A total of 27,901 critically ill patients were enrolled, including 1,023\\n      patients diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and congestive HF. The average age of the \\n      cohort was 64.37+/-17.36 years, and 58.13% of the patients were men. The\\n      ethnicity of patients was mainly white (64.67%). Multivariable logistic\\n      regression analyses found the risk of composite endpoints in patients with\\n      cardiomyopathy was higher than other groups [odds ratio (OR) =1.87; 95%\\n      confidence interval (CI): 1.62-2.15; P<0.001]. Compared to patients with\\n      congestive HF alone (OR =1.43; 95% CI: 1.26-1.62; P<0.001), patients with\\n      cardiomyopathy had a similar risk of in-hospital death (OR =1.35; 95% CI:\\n      1.06-1.71; P=0.014). Moreover, the risks of cardiac arrest (OR =1.53; 95% CI:\\n      1.01-2.34; P=0.029) and re-admission to the ICU (OR =1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.17;\\n      P<0.001) were both higher in patients with cardiomyopathy than other groups.\\n      After PSM, the risk of composite endpoints was still higher in patients with\\n      cardiomyopathy (OR =1.64; 95% CI: 1.33-2.02; P<0.001). The association was\\n      consistent among patients admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) and medical\\n      ICU (MICU)/surgical ICU (SICU). Conclusions: Comorbid cardiomyopathy increased\\n      the risk of composite endpoints in patients with congestive HF admitted to the\\n      ICU. Cardiomyopathy is related to the poor outcomes of critically ill patients\\n      with congestive HF.\\nCI  - 2022 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Patients in routine anesthesia \\n      group received opioid-based anesthesia. The primary outcome was the Quality of\\n      Recovery-15 scale (QoR-15) at 6 hours after surgery. The secondary outcomes\\n      included QoR-15 at 24 and 48 hours after surgery, Overall Benefit of Analgesia\\n      Score Satisfaction with pain treatment (OBAS) and acute pain intensity at 6, 24\\n      and 48 hours after surgery, and clinical outcomes of recovery after surgery.\\n      Results: A total of 159 patients were included in final analysis. The median\\n      difference in QoR-15 between opioid-sparing anesthesia and routine anesthesia was\\n      4 (95% CI: 1-6) at 6 hours, 8 (95% CI: 4-12) at 24 hours and 4.7 (95% CI: 1-6) at\\n      48 hours after surgery respectively; 73.4% of patient showed good recovery in\\n      opioid-sparing anesthesia group, compared to 53.8% in routine anesthesia group at\\n      24 hours after surgery (P=0.01). Patients demonstrated lower OBAS in\\n      opioid-sparing anesthesia group compared to routine anesthesia at all time points\\n      after surgery (P<0.05). The pain at most was significantly lower in\\n      opioid-sparing anesthesia group compared to routine anesthesia at 6 and 48 hours \\n      after surgery (P<0.05). Patients exhibited faster recovery with opioid-sparing\\n      anesthesia on time to mobilize and time to first flatus (P<0.01). Conclusions:\\n      Our intraoperative opioid-sparing anesthesia cannot improve patients\\' recovery at\\n      6 hours after VATS lung surgery, but it demonstrates better outcomes at 24 hours \\n      after surgery compared to routine anesthesia, reaching to a clinically important \\n      difference.

However, its function in extensive-stage SCLC remains controversial.\\n      Considering that the maintenance of muscle mass may affect the survival of cancer\\n      patients. Herein, a retrospective study was conducted to investigate whether\\n      sarcopenia defined by skeletal muscle mass index at the third lumbar vertebra is \\n      a prognostic factor in extensive-stage SCLC cancer patients. Methods: This\\n      retrospective analysis included extensive-stage SCLC patients diagnosed at the\\n      Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from January 2009 to March 2017 with\\n      platinum-based chemotherapy. Clinical data were collated for further examination,\\n      and CT or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT datasets were analyzed for body\\n      mass index (BMI) and L3MI. Follow-up data were collected by contacting patients\\n      or their families. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between the \\n      date of treatment started and the date of death or censoring. The Kaplan-Meier\\n      product limit method and log-rank tests were used to assess differences in OS\\n      between the high L3MI and low L3MI groups. Cox regression analysis was used to\\n      identify independent factors of OS. Results: For the 139 extensive-stage SCLC\\n      patients, the median follow-up time was 26.1 months (range, 0.4 to 79.4 months). \\n      The median OS was 9.5 months. There were no differences in age, inflammatory\\n      factors, nor progression after first-line treatment between the high L3MI and low\\n      L3MI groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the OS of the high L3MI group was \\n      significantly longer than that of the low L3MI group (14.045 vs. 9.985 months;\\n      P=0.007), and multivariate analysis identified high L3MI to be an independent\\n      prognostic factor for predicting longer OS in extensive-stage SCLC patients\\n      [hazard ratio (HR), 0.623; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.405-0.960; P=0.032].\\n      Conclusions: Sarcopenia defined by L3MI is a prognostic factor for\\n      extensive-stage SCLC patients and early intervention of muscle mass maintaining\\n      may achieve better cancer management.\\nCI  - 2022 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

However, the role of EHD2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is\\n      unknown. Methods: The link between EHD2 and LUAD and the associated underlying\\n      mechanism was determined using bioinformatics analysis. Then,\\n      immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to detect EHD2 expression level in LUAD\\n      patients. The stable transfection cell line was used to establish with lentivirus\\n      vector, and then the transfection efficiency was detected by western blot.\\n      Phagokinetic motility assays, transwell assays, and western blotting were also\\n      employed to investigate EHD2 impacts on cell viability. Results: The results\\n      indicated that EHD2 protein expression in human LUAD samples was significantly\\n      lower than that in the adjacent normal tissues. Low EHD2 expression was\\n      significantly linked to lymph node metastasis as well as advanced\\n      tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging (P<0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve\\n      showed that low EHD2 expression was significantly associated with low survival\\n      (P=0.01). The multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that EHD2 expression\\n      and TNM stage were independent prognostic factors for LUAD patients (all P<0.05).\\n      The in vitro experiments demonstrated that EHD2 knockdown markedly contributed to\\n      an increase in migration and invasion in A549 cells. Overexpression of EHD2\\n      substantially suppressed H1299 cell migration and invasion. Furthermore,\\n      decreased E-cadherin expression was observed in A549 cells with EHD2 knockdown,\\n      as well as increased N-cadherin and vimentin expressions. By contrast, E-cadherin\\n      expression was increased in H1299 cells, whereas N-cadherin and vimentin\\n      expressions were decreased as a result of EHD2 overexpression. Conclusions: Our\\n      study demonstrated that EHD2 reduces LUAD migration and invasion by preventing\\n      the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Furthermore, the results\\n      suggest that EHD2 may be a novel biomarker for prognosis prediction.\\nCI  - 2022 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Methods: This study was a post hoc analysis of a\\n      randomized controlled trial designed to compare oral zabofloxacin with\\n      moxifloxacin for treating outpatients with moderate AECOPD. From clinics across\\n      South Korea, 342 subjects with AECOPD were enrolled, and their blood, sputum, and\\n      urine samples were collected at baseline. A serologic test, sputum culture and\\n      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and UAT were performed to identify bacterial\\n      pathogens. Bacterial prevalence and regional distributions were analyzed. The\\n      patients\\' characteristics and clinical response between UAT-positive and\\n      UAT-negative groups were compared, as were the Streptococcus pneumoniae detection\\n      rates using conventional sputum culture and PCR versus UAT. Results: The most\\n      commonly isolated pathogen was Haemophilus influenzae (30.3%), followed by\\n      Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.0%), with no\\n      significant regional differences in bacterial distribution. Patients with\\n      positive UAT for Streptococcus pneumoniae showed no clinical failure when treated\\n      with respiratory quinolone (0.0%), whereas 11.8% of patients with negative UAT\\n      showed clinical failure (P=0.037). UAT showed moderate agreement with sputum\\n      culture by kappa coefficient (kappa=0.476). Conclusions: The bacterial prevalence\\n      in patients with moderate AECOPD in South Korea showed correlations with the\\n      global prevalence, without significant regional differences. In outpatient\\n      settings, UAT has the potential to be used as a supplemental tool with sputum\\n      culture as a guide for determining the suspicion of bacterial exacerbation.\\nCI  - 2022 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

The aim of\\n      this study was to investigate the efficacy of low-dose corticosteroid\\n      administration in patients with ARDS. Methods: A prospective observational study \\n      of patients with ARDS in 17 hospitals in China was performed between March 2016\\n      and February 2018. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for\\n      differences in baseline characteristics between different groups. The effects of \\n      corticosteroids were assessed by using the Kaplan-Meier method and a multivariate\\n      Cox regression. Results: A total of 527 ARDS patients were enrolled in the study.\\n      Sixty-five patients (12.3%) were administered low-dose (methylprednisolone </=1\\n      mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) corticosteroids. The median dose was equivalent to 0.67\\n      (0.57-0.81) mg/kg methylprednisolone for a median duration of 10 days. The\\n      control group included 224 patients (42.5%) who had never receive\\n      corticosteroids. In the matched sample, the hospital mortality rates in the\\n      low-dose (n=40) and control groups (n=80) were 27.5% and 42.5% (P=0.110),\\n      respectively. The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the\\n      low-dose corticosteroid group than in the control group (24.0 vs. 17.0, P=0.002),\\n      and the multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the low-dose group\\n      had a significantly lower risk of death than the control group (HR: 0.48; 95% CI:\\n      0.24-0.97; P=0.040).

Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results\\n      (SEER)-Medicare database, we identified patients aged >/=66 with metastatic NSCLC\\n      treated with SBRT as first-line treatment between 2004 and 2014. Multivariable\\n      logistic regression identified covariates associated with SBRT. Overall survival \\n      (OS) between SBRT and chemotherapy was compared using the Kaplan-Meier estimator \\n      and Cox proportional hazards regression. To compare hospitalizations and\\n      associated costs, we matched patients treated with SBRT to those with comparable \\n      prognostic factors receiving chemotherapy. Results: We identified 215 patients\\n      with metastatic NSCLC who received SBRT and 12,486 patients who received\\n      chemotherapy as first-line treatment. SBRT use increased from 0.5% to 3% and was \\n      associated with older age, female sex, poor disability status, and lower T- and\\n      N-stage. OS increased with SBRT, female sex, higher income and decreased with\\n      higher Charlson Comorbidity Score >/=2, poor disability status, higher T-stage\\n      and higher N-stage. Among a matched sample, SBRT patients underwent fewer\\n      hospitalizations vs. chemotherapy patients (73% vs. 81%, P=0.02). Among those\\n      hospitalized, SBRT patients incurred higher hospitalization costs ($33,063 vs.\\n      $23,865, P<0.001) but costs per month of survival were similar. Conclusions: SBRT\\n      is increasing among Medicare patients with metastatic NSCLC. Our findings suggest\\n      that SBRT may play a role in management of select metastatic NSCLC patients in\\n      addition to standard-of-care chemotherapy.\\nCI  - 2022 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Methods: Transcriptomic data for ESCC tissues and normal tissues\\n      and clinical materials of patients with ESCC were obtained from The Cancer Genome\\n      Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The differences in \\n      mRNA levels in cancer tissues and noncancerous tissues were analyzed, and we\\n      subsequently investigated the association between miR-145-5p expression and the\\n      key parameters of ESCC progression and prognosis. Additionally, cytological\\n      experiments were performed to evaluate the biological functions of miR-145-5p.\\n      Pathways potentially affected by miR-145-5p were analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment \\n      Analysis (GSEA) and REACTOME. We also analyzed the function of miR-145-5p in\\n      immune infiltration through the TIMER2 (Tumor Immune Estimation Resource)\\n      database. Results: The analysis of gene chip data from the TCGA database and GEO \\n      database (including GSE13937 and GSE43732) showed that the expression of\\n      miR-145-5p is downregulated in ESCC (P<0.05) and that patients with high\\n      miR-145-5p levels had lower survival rates (P<0.05). The expression of miR-145-5p\\n      was significantly correlated with the disease-free survival (DFS) rate (P<0.05)\\n      and M stage (P<0.05) in the TCGA database and was significantly correlated with\\n      the T stage (P<0.05) and TNM stage (P<0.05) in the GSE13937 database. Functional \\n      experiments showed that miR-145-5p attenuated proliferation (P<0.05), migration\\n      (P<0.01) and invasion (P<0.01) in the Eca109 cell line. Both GSEA gene enrichment\\n      and REACTOME gene enrichment revealed that miR-145-5p was associated with tumor\\n      signaling pathways and immune signaling pathways. Immune infiltration analysis\\n      revealed that the expression level of miR-145-5p was significantly correlated\\n      with the infiltration level of macrophages (P<0.05) and was positively correlated\\n      with the level of gene markers of M2 macrophages and tumor-associated macrophages\\n      (P<0.05). Conclusions: MiR-145-5p acts as a tumor suppressor microRNA in ESCC and\\n      is an important noncoding RNA in the high M2-like tumor-associated macrophage\\n      infiltration of ESCC. Assessing the miR-145-5p level in ESCC samples has\\n      translational meaning, which help illustrate the immune infiltration status,\\n      predict the prognostic outcome, and select the type of immunochemotherapy.\\nCI  - 2022 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

This study\\n      investigated the role and mechanism of the TRPA1/TRPV1 pathway in airway\\n      inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) induced by acute ozone\\n      exposure. Methods: C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks) were intraperitoneally injected with\\n      phosphate buffered saline (PBS), A967079 (TRPA1 inhibitor) or AMG9810 (TRPV1\\n      inhibitor) 1 h before or after ozone exposure (2.5 ppm, 3 h). BHR, cell counts in\\n      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, oxidative stress biomarkers, inflammatory\\n      cytokines, TRPA1 and TPRV1 protein levels, mitochondrial dynamics- and\\n      mitophagy-related protein levels, and activities of mitochondrial respiratory\\n      chain (MRC) in lung were measured.

We aimed to explore the optimal feature genes\\n      (OFGs) for CAD and to investigate the function of immune cell infiltration of\\n      CAD. It will be helpful for better understanding of the pathogenesis and the\\n      development of genetic prediction of CAD. Methods: Datasets related to CAD were\\n      obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Cases from the datasets\\n      met diagnostic criteria including clinical symptoms, electrocardiographic (ECG)\\n      and angiographic evidence. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs)\\n      and conducted functional enrichment analysis. OFGs were obtained from the least\\n      absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, support vector\\n      machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm, and random forest (RF)\\n      algorithm. CIBERSORT was used to compare immune infiltration between CAD patients\\n      and normal controls, and the correlation between OFGs and immune cells was\\n      analyzed. Results: DEGs were involved in the interleukin (IL)-17 signaling\\n      pathway, nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B signaling pathway, and tumor necrosis factor\\n      (TNF) signaling pathway. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed DEGs were enriched \\n      in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tertiary granule, and pattern recognition receptor\\n      activity. Disease Ontology (DO) analysis suggested DEGs were enriched in lung\\n      disease, arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Matrix metalloproteinase \\n      9 (MMP9), Pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (PELI1), thrombomodulin (THBD),\\n      and zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36) were screened by the intersection of OFGs\\n      obtained from LASSO, SVM-REF, and RF algorithms. CAD patients had a lower\\n      proportion of memory B cells (P=0.019), CD8 T cells (P<0.001), resting memory CD4\\n      T cells (P<0.001), regulatory T cells (P=0.028), and gamma delta T cells\\n      (P<0.001) than normal controls, while the proportion of activated memory CD4 T\\n      cells (P=0.014), resting natural killer (NK) cells (P<0.001), monocytes\\n      (P<0.001), M0 macrophages (P=0.023), activated mast cells (P<0.001), and\\n      neutrophils (P<0.001) in CAD patients were higher than normal controls. MMP9,\\n      PELI1, THBD, and ZFP36 were correlated with immune cells. Conclusions: MMP9,\\n      PELI1, THBD, and ZFP36 may be predicted biomarkers for CAD. The OFGs and\\n      association between OFGs and immune infiltration may provide potential biomarkers\\n      for CAD prediction along with the better assessment of the disease.\\nCI  - 2022 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

To explore whether transcatheter closure with patent\\n      ductus arteriosus (PDA) occluders is possible for ISVD. Methods: From June 2014\\n      to March 2021, 12 patients were recruited diagnosed as <25 mm ISVD. The\\n      three-dimensional printing (3DP) heart model was produced based on multi-slice\\n      computed tomography (MSCT) scans. Preoperative closure simulation was planned on \\n      the personalized 3D model for each patient. Follow-up including\\n      electrocardiography (ECG), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and X-ray was\\n      traced. Results: 3DP models of 12 patients were successfully printed. Twelve\\n      patients had been diagnosed with <25 mm ISVD and 4 of them had another secundum\\n      atrial septal defect (ASD). All patients were produced interventional therapy\\n      successfully. PDA occluder was implanted to closed ISVD, and ASD was closed using\\n      ASD occluder simultaneously. The average diameter of ISVD measured by TTE was\\n      (12.67+/-3.80), and the average diameter of sagittal axes and longitudinal axes\\n      measured by the 3D-printed model was (17.08+/-3.20) and (18.42+/-4.62) mm,\\n      respectively. The average size of PDA (diameter of pulmonary artery side) was\\n      (28.17+/-3.35) mm. Compared with the preoperative, the X-ray cardiothoracic ratio\\n      (0.51+/-0.04 vs. 0.47+/-0.06, P=0.007) and the right ventricle anterior-posterior\\n      diameter (31.17+/-5.65 vs. 24.58+/-3.75 mm, P<0.001) of postoperative was\\n      significantly decreased. During the average (47.75+/-27.52) months follow-up, it \\n      has achieved satisfying results, and there were no severe adverse events such as \\n      device transposition, death, and pericardial tamponade occurred. Conclusions:\\n      Assisting by 3D heart model, transcatheter closure of ISVD with PDA occluder had \\n      an excellent outcome. This method provides a new considerable treatment strategy \\n      for ISVD.\\nCI  - 2022 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

The congestive heart failure, hypertension, age,\\n      diabetes, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack (2 points) (CHADS2) and\\n      CHADS2 score with 2 points assigned for age >75 years-vascular disease\\n      (CHA2DS2-VASc) scores are widely used for risk stratification management of\\n      non-valvular atrial fibrillation stroke and have high prognostic value in\\n      cardiovascular disease. This study aims to investigate the predictive value of\\n      the emergency CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc score on coronary artery lesions and\\n      prognosis in patients with acute STEMI. Methods: A total of 524 patients with\\n      STEMI from May 2018 to October 2021 were selected for emergency CHADS2 and\\n      CHA2DS2-VASc. Clinical data and laboratory indicators were collected.

The aim of the study is to\\n      investigate the safety and efficacy of hybrid VATS SL. Methods: We collected 112 \\n      patients who received hybrid VATS SL or thoracotomy SL for primary treatment of\\n      NSCLC at Liaoning Cancer Hospital & Institute from November 2016 to September\\n      2021. Perioperative and survival data were collected, and retrospective analysis \\n      was conducted on 91 thoracotomy and 21 hybrid VATS SL patients to evaluate the\\n      safety and efficacy of two approaches. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used\\n      to minimize selection bias. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to compare\\n      overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Follow-up data were\\n      obtained by outpatient clinical visit and nurse-led telephone. Results: A total\\n      of 112 patients were included in this study, including thoracotomy patients\\n      (n=91) and hybrid VATS patients (n=21). In the non-match analysis, the baseline\\n      data of patients was similar between the two groups, except regarding the receipt\\n      of neoadjuvant therapy (P=0.087). After PSM (2:1), a total of 39 thoracotomy\\n      patients and 19 hybrid VATS patients were enrolled. The baseline variables were\\n      quite similar in both groups. In the hybrid group, the number of lymph nodes\\n      (25.9+/-8.5 vs. 32.9+/-9.7, P<0.01) and positive lymph nodes (3.7+/-2.9 vs.\\n      5.6+/-4.0, P=0.045) were significantly higher than those in the thoracotomy\\n      group. The hybrid group was associated with significantly shorter postoperative\\n      hospital stay (9.5+/-3.5 vs. 7.3+/-2.9, P=0.021) and chest tube duration time\\n      (6.6+/-3.1 vs. 5.3+/-1.5, P=0.031). No statistical difference in complications,\\n      reoperation, and recurrence were observed between the hybrid VATS SL and\\n      thoracotomy SL (P=1.0, P=1.0, P=0.472). The 30- and 90-day mortalities showed no \\n      differences between approaches (2.6% vs. 0%, P=1.0; 5.1% vs. 5.3%, P=1.0). No\\n      significant differences were found between thoracotomy and hybrid VATS SL in\\n      3-year OS (P=0.614) and 3-year RFS (P=0.750).

To date, only Afghanistan and Pakistan\\n      have failed to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission. Circulation of\\n      vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) continues to be a problem in high-risk areas \\n      of the Eastern Mediterranean, African, and Southeast Asian regions. Environmental\\n      surveillance (ES) is an important adjunct to AFP surveillance, helping to\\n      identify circulating polioviruses in problematic areas. Stools from AFP cases and\\n      contacts (>200,000 specimens/year) and ES samples (>642 sites) are referred to\\n      146 laboratories in the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) for testing.\\n      Although most World Health Organization supported laboratories use the two-phase \\n      separation method due to its simplicity and effectiveness, alternative simple,\\n      widely available, and cost-effective methods are needed. The CAFE (Concentration \\n      and Filtration Elution) method was developed from existing filtration methods to \\n      handle any type of sewage or residual waters. At $10-20 US per sample for\\n      consumable materials, CAFE is cost effective, and all equipment and reagents are \\n      readily available from markets and suppliers globally. The report describes the\\n      results from a parallel study of CAFE method with the standard two-phase\\n      separation method. The study was performed with samples collected from five\\n      countries (Guatemala, Haiti, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines),\\n      run in three laboratories-(United States, Thailand and in the Philippines) to\\n      account for regional and sample-to-sample variability. Samples from each site\\n      were divided into two 500 ml aliquots and processed by both methods, with no\\n      other additional concentration or manipulation. The results of 338\\n      parallel-tested samples show that the CAFE method is more sensitive than the\\n      two-phase separation method for detection of non-polio enteroviruses (p-value <\\n      0.0001) and performed as well as the two-phase separation method for polioviruses\\n      detection with no significant difference (p-value > 0.05). The CAFE method is a\\n      robust, sensitive, and cost-effective method for isolating enteroviruses from\\n      residual waters.\\nFAU - Belgasmi, Hanen\\nAU  - Belgasmi H\\nAD  - Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for\\n      Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.\\nFAU - Miles, Stacey Jeffries\\nAU  - Miles SJ\\nAD  - Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for\\n      Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.\\nFAU - Sayyad, Leanna\\nAU  - Sayyad L\\nAD  - Cherokee Nation Assurance, Tulsa, OK, United States.\\nFAU - Wong, Kimberly\\nAU  - Wong K\\nAD  - Cherokee Nation Assurance, Tulsa, OK, United States.\\nFAU - Harrington, Chelsea\\nAU  - Harrington C\\nAD  - Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for\\n      Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.\\nFAU - Gerloff, Nancy\\nAU  - Gerloff N\\nAD  - Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for\\n      Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.\\nFAU - Coulliette-Salmond, Angela D\\nAU  - Coulliette-Salmond AD\\nAD  - Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for\\n      Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.\\nAD  - U.S Public Health Service, Rockville, MD, United States.\\nFAU - Guntapong, Ratigorn\\nAU  - Guntapong R\\nAD  - Department of Medical Science, Enteric Viruses Section, National Institute of\\n      Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand.\\nFAU - Tacharoenmuang, Ratana\\nAU  - Tacharoenmuang R\\nAD  - Department of Medical Science, Enteric Viruses Section, National Institute of\\n      Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand.\\nFAU - Ayutthaya, Apiradee Isarangkul Na\\nAU  - Ayutthaya AIN\\nAD  - Department of Medical Science, Enteric Viruses Section, National Institute of\\n      Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand.\\nFAU - Apostol, Lea Necitas G\\nAU  - Apostol LNG\\nAD  - Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, Muntinlupa City, Philippines.\\nFAU - Valencia, Ma Anne-Lesley D\\nAU  - Valencia MAD\\nAD  - Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, Muntinlupa City, Philippines.\\nFAU - Burns, Cara C\\nAU  - Burns CC\\nAD  - Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for\\n      Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.\\nFAU - Benito, Gloria-Rey\\nAU  - Benito GR\\nAD  - Pan American Health Organization, World Health Organization, Washington, DC,\\n      United States.\\nFAU - Vega, Everardo\\nAU  - Vega E\\nAD  - Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for\\n      Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Environ Sci\\nJT  - Frontiers in environmental science\\nJID - 101638676\\nPMC - PMC9344547\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - enterovirus\\nOT  - environmental surveillance\\nOT  - filtration\\nOT  - poliovirus\\nOT  - two-phase separation\\nOT  - vaccine-derived poliovirus\\nOT  - wastewater\\nCOIS- Conflict of Interest: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the \\n      absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a\\n      potential conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:14\\nPMCR- 2023/07/04 00:00\\nPHST- 2023/07/04 00:00 [pmc-release]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:14 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fenvs.2022.914387 [doi]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - Front Environ Sci. 2022 Jul 4;10. doi: 10.3389/fenvs.2022.914387.\\n\\nPMID- 35928595\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2211-3355 (Print)\\nIS  - 2211-3355 (Linking)\\nVI  - 29\\nDP  - 2022 Oct\\nTI  - 5-year risk of \"adult-onset\" chronic diseases during childhood and adolescent\\n      transitioning for individuals with cerebral palsy.\\nPG  - 101933\\nLID - 10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101933 [doi]\\nAB  - Epidemiologic evidence documenting risk of chronic diseases as children with\\n      cerebral palsy age throughout growth is lacking to inform prevention strategies. \\n      The objective was to characterize the 5-year risk of chronic diseases that are\\n      typically associated with advanced aging among < 1-13 year olds with cerebral\\n      palsy and effects by patient-level factors.

Our previous\\n      research found that an early 4-week exercise intervention in middle cerebral\\n      artery occlusion (MCAO) rats can promote the release of exosomes and protect the \\n      brain. This study intended to further explore the intrinsic mechanism of\\n      neuroprotection by exosome release after exercise. Methods: Rats were randomly\\n      divided into four groups: the sham operation (SHAM), middle cerebral artery\\n      occlusion (MCAO) with sedentary intervention (SED-MCAO), MCAO with exercise\\n      intervention (EX-MCAO), and MCAO with exercise intervention and exosome injection\\n      (EX-MCAO-EXO). Modified neurological severity score (mNSS), cerebral infarction\\n      volume ratio, microglial activation, dendritic complexity, and expression of\\n      synaptophysin (Syn) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) were detected\\n      after 28 days of intervention. Results: (1) The exercise improved body weight and\\n      mNSS score, and the survival state of the rats after exosome infusion was better.\\n      (2) Compared with the SED-MCAO group, the EX-MCAO (P = 0.039) and EX-MCAO-EXO\\n      groups (P = 0.002) had significantly lower cerebral infarct volume ratios (P <\\n      0.05), among which the EX-MCAO-EXO group had the lowest (P = 0.031). (3) Compared\\n      with the SED-MCAO group, the EX-MCAO and EX-MCAO-EXO groups had a significantly\\n      decreased number of microglia (P < 0.001) and significantly increased process\\n      length/cell (P < 0.01) and end point/cell (P < 0.01) values, with the EX-MCAO-EXO\\n      group having the lowest number of microglia (P = 0.036) and most significantly\\n      increased end point/cell value (P = 0.027). (4) Compared with the SED-MCAO group,\\n      the total number of intersections and branches of the apical and basal dendrites \\n      in the EX-MCAO and EX-MCAO-EXO groups was increased significantly (P < 0.05), and\\n      the increase was more significant in the EX-MCAO-EXO group (P < 0.05). (5) The\\n      expression levels of Syn and PSD-95 in the EX-MCAO (P Syn = 0.043, P PSD-95 =\\n      0.047) and EX-MCAO-EXO groups were significantly higher than those in the\\n      SED-MCAO group (P < 0.05), and the expression levels in the EX-MCAO-EXO group\\n      were significantly higher than those in the EX-MCAO group (P < 0.05).

Methods:\\n      Seven participants (58 +/- 12 years) performed a non-exercise control session\\n      (CTL) and a single bout of MCT on separate days and in a randomized\\n      counterbalanced order. The MCT included 10 exercises with 3 sets of 15-repetition\\n      maximum per exercise, with each set interspersed with 45 s of walking. Systolic\\n      (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac\\n      output (Q), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and\\n      heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed 10 min before and 40 min after CTL and\\n      MCT. BP and HRV were also measured during an ambulatory 24-h recovery period.\\n      Results: Compared to CTL, SBP (-22%), DBP (-28%), SVR (-43%), BRS (-63%), and\\n      parasympathetic activity (HF; high-frequency component: -63%) were reduced during\\n      40 min post-MCT (p < 0.05), while Q (35%), sympathetic activity (LF;\\n      low-frequency component: 139%) and sympathovagal balance (LF:HF ratio: 145%) were\\n      higher (p < 0.001). In the first 10 h of ambulatory assessment, SBP (-7%), MAP\\n      (-6%), and HF (-26%) remained lowered, and LF (11%) and LF:HF ratio (13%)\\n      remained elevated post-MCT vs. CTL (p < 0.05). Conclusion: A single bout of MCT\\n      elicited prolonged PEH in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients.

The results\\n      showed that compared to the low-fat group, the high-fat group had lower egg\\n      production (p < 0.05) and higher average daily feed intake and feed-to-egg ratio \\n      (p < 0.05). At the 21(st) day, the serum levels of triglyceride (TC) and\\n      superoxide dismutase (SOD) were higher (p < 0.05), high-density lipoproteins\\n      cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were lower (p < 0.01), catalase (CAT) activity was\\n      lower (p < 0.05), TC and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in liver were higher (p <\\n      0.01) and SOD activity in liver was lower (p < 0.05) in layers supplemented with \\n      soy lecithin. CAT activity in serum was increased (p < 0.01) and total\\n      antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activity in the liver was decreased (p < 0.05) after\\n      increasing the dietary fat concentration. The addition of soy lecithin and the\\n      increase in dietary fat concentration had a highly significant interaction on\\n      serum CAT activity and liver TC content in layers (p < 0.01). At the 35(th) day, \\n      the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was higher (p < 0.01), serum\\n      glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and CAT activity were higher (p < 0.05), and\\n      serum triglyceride (TG) content and total T-AOC capacity activity were lower (p <\\n      0.05) in layers supplemented with soy lecithin. Increasing dietary fat\\n      concentration decreased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate\\n      aminotransferase (AST) and GSH-Px activity in serum (p < 0.05). However, it\\n      increased TG and MDA content in liver (p < 0.05), and highly decreased SOD\\n      content in liver (p < 0.01) in layers. The addition of soy lecithin and\\n      increasing dietary fat concentration had a highly significant reciprocal effect\\n      on serum ALT viability and CAT viability (p < 0.01) and liver TG and MDA content \\n      and SOD viability (p < 0.05) in layers. In conclusion, feeding high-fat diets\\n      will adversely affect the laying performance of laying hens, while long-term\\n      addition of lecithin can improve the blood lipids and liver lipids of laying\\n      hens, enhance the antioxidant capacity of the liver, and maintain liver health.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Hu, Xiong, Liu, Yang, Hu, Chen, Wang, Liao, Lv, Liu, Huang and\\n      Lin.\\nFAU - Hu, Gui-Li\\nAU  - Hu GL\\nAD  - Centree Bio-tech (Wuhan) Co., LTD, Wuhan, China.\\nFAU - Xiong, Juan\\nAU  - Xiong J\\nAD  - Centree Bio-tech (Wuhan) Co., LTD, Wuhan, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Yang\\nAU  - Liu Y\\nAD  - Institute of Bast Fiber Crops, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\\n      Changsha, China.\\nFAU - Yang, Hong-Jun\\nAU  - Yang HJ\\nAD  - Centree Bio-tech (Wuhan) Co., LTD, Wuhan, China.\\nFAU - Hu, Ling-Ling\\nAU  - Hu LL\\nAD  - Centree Bio-tech (Wuhan) Co., LTD, Wuhan, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Peng\\nAU  - Chen P\\nAD  - Centree Bio-tech (Wuhan) Co., LTD, Wuhan, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Xin\\nAU  - Wang X\\nAD  - Institute of Bast Fiber Crops, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\\n      Changsha, China.\\nFAU - Liao, Shuang\\nAU  - Liao S\\nAD  - Institute of Bast Fiber Crops, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\\n      Changsha, China.\\nFAU - Lv, Tuo\\nAU  - Lv T\\nAD  - Institute of Bast Fiber Crops, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\\n      Changsha, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Chun-Jie\\nAU  - Liu CJ\\nAD  - Institute of Bast Fiber Crops, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\\n      Changsha, China.\\nFAU - Huang, Peng\\nAU  - Huang P\\nAD  - Institute of Bast Fiber Crops, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\\n      Changsha, China.\\nFAU - Lin, Qian\\nAU  - Lin Q\\nAD  - Institute of Bast Fiber Crops, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,\\n      Changsha, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Physiol\\nJT  - Frontiers in physiology\\nJID - 101549006\\nPMC - PMC9343795\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - antioxidant index\\nOT  - biochemical indexes\\nOT  - laying performance\\nOT  - liver health\\nOT  - soy lecithin\\nCOIS- G-LH, JX, H-JY, L-LH, PC was employed by Centree Bio-tech (Wuhan) Co., LTD.

Angiotensin-(1-7) binds to Mas receptors localized in\\n      different cells throughout the body. Whether angiotensin-(1-7) exerts any action \\n      in the urinary bladder (UB) is still unknown. We investigated the effects of\\n      intravenous and topical (in situ) administration of angiotensin-(1-7) on\\n      intravesical pressure (IP) and cardiovascular variables. In addition, the Mas\\n      receptors and ACE-2 gene and protein expression were analyzed in the UB. Adult\\n      female Wistar rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in 100% O2 and submitted \\n      to the catheterization of the femoral artery and vein for mean arterial pressure \\n      (MAP) and heart rate (HR) recordings, and infusion of drugs, respectively. The\\n      renal blood flow was acquired using a Doppler flow probe placed around the left\\n      renal artery and the renal conductance (RC) was calculated as a ratio of Doppler \\n      shift (kHz) and MAP. The cannulation of the UB was performed for IP recording. We\\n      observed that angiotensin-(1-7) either administered intravenously [115.8 +/-\\n      28.6% angiotensin-(1-7) vs. -2.9 +/- 1.3% saline] or topically [147.4 +/- 18.9%\\n      angiotensin-(1-7) vs. 3.2 +/- 2.8% saline] onto the UB evoked a significant (p < \\n      0.05) increase in IP compared to saline and yielded no changes in MAP, HR, and\\n      RC. The marked response of angiotensin-(1-7) on the UB was also investigated\\n      using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting\\n      assay, which demonstrated the mRNA and protein expression of Mas receptors in the\\n      bladder, respectively. ACE-2 mRNA and protein expression was also observed in the\\n      bladder. Therefore, the findings demonstrate that angiotensin-(1-7) acts in the\\n      UB to increase the IP and suggest that this peptide can be also locally\\n      synthesized in the UB.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Lamy, Cafarchio, do Vale, Antonio, Venancio, de Souza, Maciel,\\n      Giannocco, Silva Neto, Oyama, Aronsson and Sato.\\nFAU - Lamy, Gustavo B\\nAU  - Lamy GB\\nAD  - Department Morphology and Physiology, Centro Universitario FMABC, Santo Andre,\\n      Brazil.\\nFAU - Cafarchio, Eduardo M\\nAU  - Cafarchio EM\\nAD  - Department Morphology and Physiology, Centro Universitario FMABC, Santo Andre,\\n      Brazil.\\nFAU - do Vale, Barbara\\nAU  - do Vale B\\nAD  - Department Morphology and Physiology, Centro Universitario FMABC, Santo Andre,\\n      Brazil.\\nFAU - Antonio, Bruno B\\nAU  - Antonio BB\\nAD  - Department Morphology and Physiology, Centro Universitario FMABC, Santo Andre,\\n      Brazil.\\nFAU - Venancio, Daniel P\\nAU  - Venancio DP\\nAD  - Department Morphology and Physiology, Centro Universitario FMABC, Santo Andre,\\n      Brazil.\\nFAU - de Souza, Janaina S\\nAU  - de Souza JS\\nAD  - Department Biological Sciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Diadema, Brazil.\\nFAU - Maciel, Rui M\\nAU  - Maciel RM\\nAD  - Department Medicine, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Giannocco, Gisele\\nAU  - Giannocco G\\nAD  - Department Biological Sciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Diadema, Brazil.\\nAD  - Department Medicine, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Silva Neto, Artur F\\nAU  - Silva Neto AF\\nAD  - Department Physiology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Oyama, Lila M\\nAU  - Oyama LM\\nAD  - Department Physiology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Aronsson, Patrik\\nAU  - Aronsson P\\nAD  - Department Pharmacology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska\\n      Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.\\nFAU - Sato, Monica A\\nAU  - Sato MA\\nAD  - Department Morphology and Physiology, Centro Universitario FMABC, Santo Andre,\\n      Brazil.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Physiol\\nJT  - Frontiers in physiology\\nJID - 101549006\\nPMC - PMC9345415\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - ACE-2\\nOT  - Mas receptors\\nOT  - intravesical pressure\\nOT  - micturition\\nOT  - urinary bladder\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:13\\nPHST- 2022/04/14 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/13 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:13 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.920636 [doi]\\nAID - 920636 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Physiol. 2022 Jul 19;13:920636. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2022.920636. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928552\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2666-6677 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2666-6677 (Linking)\\nVI  - 11\\nDP  - 2022 Sep\\nTI  - Obesity in young sudden cardiac death: Rates, clinical features, and insights\\n      into people with body mass index >50kg/m(2).\\nPG  - 100369\\nLID - 10.1016/j.ajpc.2022.100369 [doi]\\nAB  - Objective: To contextualize obesity rates in young sudden cardiac death (SCD)\\n      against the age-matched national population, and identify clinical and pathologic\\n      features in WHO class II and III obesity. Methods: A prospective state-wide\\n      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry included all SCDs in Victoria, Australia \\n      from 2019-2021. Body mass indices (BMIs) of patients 18-50 years were compared to\\n      age-referenced general population. Characteristics of SCD patients with WHO Class\\n      II obesity (BMI >/=30kg/m(2)) and non-obesity (BMI<30kg/m(2)) were compared.\\n      Clinical characteristics of people with BMI>50kg/m(2) were assessed. Results: 504\\n      patients were included. Obesity was strongly over-represented in young SCD\\n      compared to the age-matched general population (55.0% vs 28.7%, p<0.0001). Obese \\n      SCD patients more frequently had hypertension, diabetes and obstructive sleep\\n      apnoea (p<0.0001, p=0.009 and p=0.001 respectively), ventricular fibrillation as \\n      their arrest rhythm (p=0.008) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (p<0.0001). \\n      Obese patients were less likely to have toxicology positive for illicit\\n      substances (22.0% vs 32.6%, p=0.008) or history of alcohol abuse (18.8% vs 26.9%,\\n      p=0.030). Patients with BMI>50 kg/m(2) represented 8.5% of young SCD. LVH (n=26, \\n      60.5%) was their predominant cause of death and only 10 (9.3%) patients died from\\n      coronary disease. Conclusion: Over half of young Australian SCD patients are\\n      obese, with all obesity classes over-represented compared to the general\\n      population. Obese patients had more cardiac risk factors. Almost two thirds of\\n      patients with BMI>50 kg/m(2) died from LVH, with fewer than 10% dying from\\n      coronary disease.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Author(s).\\nFAU - Paratz, Elizabeth D\\nAU  - Paratz ED\\nAD  -

There is prevalent practice of\\n      surgical site hair shaving as a part of preoperative preparation. There is\\n      uncertainty regarding the benefit versus harm of shaving for SSIs. Hairs at\\n      surgical sites are removed prior to surgery most often by shaving. We performed\\n      this study to look for what impact preoperative hair removal by shaving has on\\n      postoperative SSI. Methods We performed prospective comparative cohort study in\\n      patients undergoing elective abdominal surgeries. We included clean and\\n      clean-contaminated surgeries in immunocompetent patients of which half were\\n      shaved and other half not shaved prior to surgery. Other confounding factors like\\n      skin cleaning, aseptic technique of surgery, antibiotic prophylaxis and\\n      treatment, and postoperative wound care were as per care. Patients were assessed \\n      for presence and grade of SSI postoperatively on day 7, 14, and 30. Results were \\n      analyzed statistically using chi-square and Fischer\\'s exact tests for\\n      significance in entire sample as well as in demographic subgroups. Results\\n      Overall SSI rate was 11.42%. There was no statistically significant difference in\\n      SSI rates between patients who underwent preoperative surgical site hair removal \\n      by shaving (232) and who did not have shaving (232) on all the three different\\n      assessment timelines in postoperative period, namely, day 7, 14, and 30. Although\\n      the absolute number of patients who had SSI was more in those who underwent\\n      preoperative surgical site hair removal by shaving, the difference was not\\n      statistically significant ( p > 0.05). But on subgroup analysis patients with\\n      clean-contaminated surgeries ( p = 0.037) and patients with surgeries lasting for\\n      less than 2 hours (Fischer\\'s exact = 0.034) had significantly higher SSI in the\\n      shaved group compared with unshaved on day 14. Conclusion As per our results,\\n      preoperative shaving did not significantly increase overall SSI except in\\n      subgroup of clean-contaminated surgeries and in surgeries of less than 2 hours\\'\\n      duration. So especially in these patients avoiding preoperative surgical site\\n      hair shaving may be used as one of the infection control measures.\\nCI  - The Author(s).

The incidence of\\n      perforations remains high and has the highest mortality rate of any complication \\n      of ulcer disease. Risk stratification of cases will lead to better preoperative\\n      management and efficient utilization of intensive care unit resources. The\\n      purpose of the present study is to compare different existing scoring systems and\\n      identify the most accurate predictor of mortality in perforated peptic ulcer\\n      (PPU) cases. Materials and Methods This is an observational study conducted in\\n      Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences, Hubli, India. All cases of PPU disease\\n      admitted from December 2017 to August 2019 who were treated surgically were\\n      included in the study. Demographic data were collected and peptic ulcer\\n      perforation (PULP) score, Mannheim peritonitis index (MPI), American Society of\\n      Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, and Jabalpur score (JS) were calculated for\\n      individual patient and compared. The patient was followed up during the\\n      postoperative period. Observation A total of 45 patients were included in the\\n      study with a mean age of 42.5 years. Most of the patients presented with 24 hours\\n      of the onset of symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use was noted in\\n      8.9% patients, and steroid use was present in 2.2% patients. Of the 45 patients, \\n      7 deaths were reported. Between the various scoring systems, the MPI and JS were \\n      better predictors of mortality with a p -value of <0.001 and 0.007, respectively.\\n      In contrast, the PULP and ASA scores had p -value not statistically significant. \\n      However, the PULP score was a better predictor of postoperative complication with\\n      a p -value of 0.047. Conclusion Of the four scoring systems validated, the MPI\\n      and JS were better predictors of mortality in the given population. PULP score is\\n      a better predictor of postoperative complications in the present study.\\nCI  - The Author(s).

Its screening during\\n      pregnancy makes it possible to identify carriers of the S gene which constitute a\\n      risk for the unborn child. In order to promote the use of immuno-chromatographic \\n      tests, we have set ourselves the task of establishing the epidemiological profile\\n      and determining the Emmel test performance. Analytical cross-sectional study of\\n      three months duration carried out in the 12 departments of Congo in pregnant\\n      women, from 12 weeks of amenorrhea, Admitted for Antenatal Consultation (ANC).\\n      The studied variables were epidemiological, Emmel test and immuno-chromatographic\\n      profile of haemoglobin. 782 pregnant women screened, of which 27.88% were AS\\n      sickle cell trait and 1.79% homozygous SS. The median age of sickle cell patients\\n      was 29 years vs. 25 years (p=0.10). High education level, married status, history\\n      of transfusion and sickle cell disease, and high ANC number were more common in\\n      pregnant sickle cell patients (p<0.05).The frequency of sickle cell trait ranged \\n      from 16.67 to 31.17% and homozygous forms from 0 to 66.67% depending on the\\n      department. The sensitivity and specificity of the Emmel test were 46% and 99%\\n      with PPV and NPV of 95% and 81% respectively.

We evaluated the effect of ICU diaries, dispatched at\\n      different time points, on outcomes in an Indian cohort. DESIGN: Double-blind\\n      randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A 1,000-bedded teaching hospital in East\\n      India. PATIENTS: Mechanically ventilated (>24 hr) adults were recruited,\\n      excluding those dead or incapable of meaningful-communication at discharge or\\n      follow-up. Eighty-three patients, aged 46.2 +/- 17.2 years, Acute Physiology and \\n      Chronic Health Evaluation II scores 13.7 +/- 4.9 were assessed. Length of ICU\\n      stay was 8.2 +/- 7.1 days with 3.7 +/- 3.2 ventilator days. INTERVENTION: Of 820 \\n      screened, 164 had diaries created. Including photographs, diaries were\\n      comaintained by healthcare workers and family members. Ninety patients were\\n      randomized at 1-month follow-up: diary sent to 45 at 1 month (group ID1) and to\\n      45 at 3 months (ID3). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Anxiety-depression, memory, \\n      and QOL were assessed telephonically or home visits by a psychologist using the\\n      Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale (HADS) and other tools at ICU discharge,\\n      1-month (prerandomization), and 3 months of discharge. ID3 was reassessed after\\n      receiving diaries at 3.5 months. Primary outcome was anxiety-depression;\\n      secondary outcomes included PTSS, QOL, and memories. There was 100% follow-up. At\\n      3 months, ID1 patients had a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in HADS from\\n      baseline when compared with ID3 that had not received diaries (4.16 +/- 2.9 vs\\n      2.15 +/- 1.8; 95% CI, 2.8-1.2). PTSS scores were likewise better (p < 0.001). ID3\\n      patients demonstrated significant improvement (p < 0.01) in QOL and memories\\n      along with HADS and PTSS when assessed at 3.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: ICU diaries\\n      improve MH but not QOL when delivered at 1 month and assessed 2 months\\n      thereafter. Assessed after 15 days, delayed exposure at 3 months significantly\\n      improved QOL and memories in addition to MH.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

HCV reinfection was defined as the\\n      detection of different HCV strains beyond SVR12. HIV-negative, low-risk\\n      individuals with SVR12 served as reference patients. Crude reinfection rates and \\n      secular trends were assessed. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed \\n      to identify baseline factors associated with HCV reinfection. Results: A total of\\n      216 HIV-positive and 1589 reference patients were recruited, with median\\n      follow-up durations of 3.0 and 6.0 years, respectively. During a total of 772\\n      person-years of follow-up (PYFU), the HCV reinfection rate in HIV-positive\\n      patients was 4.02 per 100 PYFU (95% CI, 2.85-5.65), while the HCV reinfection\\n      rate in reference patients was 0.14 per 100 PYFU (95% CI, 0.09-0.23) during 10\\n      862 PYFU. HIV-positive patients had a higher risk of HCV reinfection than\\n      reference patients (hazard ratio [HR], 17.63; 95% CI, 7.10-43.80; P < .001). No\\n      baseline factors were predictive of HCV reinfection in HIV-positive patients. The\\n      incidence of HCV reinfection in HIV-positive patients increased after 2015, when \\n      DAAs were made available in Taiwan. Conclusions: The risk of HCV reinfection\\n      remains high in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with treatment-induced SVR12. In\\n      addition to mass screening and treatment scale-up, strategies to reduce\\n      reinfection are needed for HCV microelimination in HIV-positive patients in\\n      Taiwan.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.

However, compromised general health and poor oral hygiene habits at\\n      earlier ages resulted in poor status of preserved teeth. Therefore, tooth\\n      extraction is required in many aged people. More knowledge is needed because\\n      there are many risk factors during the surgery in frail aged adults. The aim of\\n      this study was to evaluate the cardiovascular response of such a population\\n      during tooth extraction and analyze risk factors to provide clinical guidance.\\n      Methods: A retrospective study was performed on aged patients with systemic\\n      diseases who underwent tooth extraction. Data regarding demographic profiles and \\n      cardiovascular parameters of heart rate and blood pressure were collected\\n      preoperative, when local anesthesia was administered, at the beginning of tooth\\n      extraction, 5 min after tooth extraction, and postoperative. The effects of risk \\n      factors, including age, sex, and systemic diseases on these parameters were\\n      analyzed with a multilevel model. Results: Heart rate (HR), systolic blood\\n      pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of aged patients increased\\n      significantly when performing local anesthesia and tooth extraction. During the\\n      operation, the older patients (beta = 2.011, P = 0.005) and the diabetics (beta =\\n      3.902, P < 0.0001) were associated with higher SBP, while those with more tooth\\n      extractions exhibited higher HR (beta = 0.893, P = 0.007). Women patients showed \\n      both significantly elevated HR (beta = 1.687, P < 0.0001) and SBP (beta = 2.268, \\n      P < 0.0001). However, for coronary artery disease patients, HR (beta = -2.747, P \\n      < 0.0001) and blood pressure [SBP (beta = -4.094, P < 0.0001) and DBP (beta =\\n      -0.87, P = 0.016)] were markedly lower than those of patients without a diagnosis\\n      of coronary artery disease. Conclusion: Cardiovascular response of aged\\n      outpatients with systemic diseases during tooth extraction is quite significant. \\n      Age, sex, systemic diseases, and the number of tooth extraction could be risk\\n      factors closely associated with cardiovascular response. The findings might\\n      provide safety guidance for dentists on tooth extraction in this population.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Li, Tian, Qi, Zhang, Li and Pan.\\nFAU - Li, Jinjin\\nAU  - Li J\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for\\n      Oral Diseases, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, West China Hospital \\n      of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for\\n      Oral Diseases, Department of Head and Neck Oncology, West China Hospital of\\n      Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Tian, Zhiyan\\nAU  - Tian Z\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for\\n      Oral Diseases, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, West China Hospital \\n      of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Qi, Shuqun\\nAU  - Qi S\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for\\n      Oral Diseases, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, West China Hospital \\n      of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Jiankang\\nAU  - Zhang J\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for\\n      Oral Diseases, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, West China Hospital \\n      of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Li, Longjiang\\nAU  - Li L\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for\\n      Oral Diseases, Department of Head and Neck Oncology, West China Hospital of\\n      Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Pan, Jian\\nAU  - Pan J\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for\\n      Oral Diseases, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, West China Hospital \\n      of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Public Health\\nJT  - Frontiers in public health\\nJID - 101616579\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9344048\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - aged patients\\nOT  - blood pressure\\nOT  - heart rate\\nOT  - multilevel model\\nOT  - systemic diseases\\nOT  - tooth extraction\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:12\\nPHST- 2022/05/07 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/20 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:12 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.938609 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Public Health. 2022 Jul 19;10:938609. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2022.938609.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928490\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2296-2565 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2296-2565 (Linking)\\nVI  - 10\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Prevalence of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Status Among Healthcare Workers and \\n      Its Impact on Their Mental Health During the Crisis of COVID-19: A\\n      Cross-Sectional Study.\\nPG  - 904550\\nLID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.904550 [doi]\\nAB  - Objective: After the unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, \\n      the health status of the general population has suffered a huge threat, and the\\n      mental health of front-line healthcare providers has also encountered great\\n      challenges. Therefore, this study aims to: (1) investigate the prevalence and\\n      influencing factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among healthcare\\n      providers, and (2) verify the moderating role of self-efficacy in the influence\\n      of PTSD on mental health. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an\\n      online survey of 1993 participants. The presence of depression, anxiety,\\n      self-efficacy, and PTSD was evaluated using screening tests from March 1.\\n      Sociodemographic and COVID-19-related data were also collected. A data analysis\\n      was performed using descriptive statistics, Pearson\\'s correlation coefficient,\\n      and multiple linear regression. Results: The prevalence of PTSD among healthcare \\n      providers was 9.3%. PTSD was negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r =\\n      -0.265, P < 0.01), anxiety (r = -0.453, P < 0.01), and depression (r = 0.708, P <\\n      0.01). Profession, daily working hours, maximum continuous working days, and\\n      daily sleep time were influencing factors of PTSD. A binary logistic regression\\n      analysis showed that physicians (OR = 2.254, 95% CI = 1.298, 3.914) and nurses\\n      (OR = 2.176, 95% CI = 1.337, 3.541) were more likely to experience PTSD than\\n      other healthcare providers. Conclusion: Self-efficacy has a moderating effect on \\n      the influence of PTSD on anxiety and depression. This suggests that health\\n      managers need to respond to the current psychological crisis of healthcare\\n      providers, implement appropriate psychological interventions, and minimize the\\n      psychological harm caused by COVID-19.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Yang, Liu, Liu, Ou, Wang, Ma, Fan, Shi and Shi.\\nFAU - Yang, Yue\\nAU  - Yang Y\\nAD  - Tumor Hospital Affiliated of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Di\\nAU  - Liu D\\nAD  - School of Marxism, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Bingshuo\\nAU  - Liu B\\nAD  - Tumor Hospital Affiliated of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.\\nFAU - Ou, Weiyan\\nAU  - Ou W\\nAD  - School of Health Management, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Licheng\\nAU  - Wang L\\nAD  - School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.\\nFAU - Ma, Yuanshuo\\nAU  - Ma Y\\nAD  - School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.\\nFAU - Fan, Lihua\\nAU  - Fan L\\nAD  - School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.\\nFAU - Shi, Yu\\nAU  - Shi Y\\nAD  - Vanke School of Public Health, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.\\nFAU - Shi, Lei\\nAU  - Shi L\\nAD  - School of Health Management, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Public Health\\nJT  - Frontiers in public health\\nJID - 101616579\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9343759\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - COVID-19\\nOT  - PTSD\\nOT  - healthcare providers\\nOT  - mental health\\nOT  - self-efficacy\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:12\\nPHST- 2022/03/25 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/21 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:12 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.904550 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Public Health. 2022 Jul 19;10:904550. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2022.904550.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928488\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2296-2565 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2296-2565 (Linking)\\nVI  - 10\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - COVID-19 vaccine uptake and associated factors among pregnant women attending\\n      antenatal care in Debre Tabor public health institutions: A cross-sectional\\n      study.\\nPG  - 919494\\nLID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.919494 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Vaccination is the best means of reducing the increased risk of\\n      severe COVID-19 during pregnancy. Data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake among pregnant \\n      women in Ethiopia is scarce. Thus, this study aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccine\\n      uptake and associated factors among pregnant women. Method: An institution-based \\n      cross-sectional study was conducted among 634 pregnant women attending antenatal \\n      care in Debre Tabor public health institutions from March 14 to 30, 2022.\\n      Participants were recruited using a multistage sampling technique and data were\\n      collected via face-to-face interviews using a pre-tested structured\\n      questionnaire. Stata version 16.0 software was used for data analysis. Multiple\\n      logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with COVID-19 \\n      vaccine uptake, with a p-value< 0.05 considered statistically significant.\\n      Result: Only 14.4% (95% CI: 11.7%-17.3%) of participants had received at least\\n      one dose of COVID-19 vaccines. The main reasons for declining vaccination were\\n      fear that the COVID-19 vaccine may have harmful side effects on the fetus or the \\n      mother. Being 45 or older (AOR: 1.75, 95%CI: 1.01-2.95), being married (AOR:\\n      1.26, 95%CI: 1.12, 2.96), having good knowledge (AOR:3.52, 95%CI:1.83-3.87), and \\n      a positive attitude (AOR:4.81, 95% CI: 1.42-7.33) were positive predictors of\\n      COVID-19 vaccine uptake. But attaining a college or university education (AOR:\\n      0.43, 95%CI: 0.12-0.69) was found to be a barrier to vaccine uptake by pregnant\\n      women. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women was substantially\\n      low. Old age, being married, low education, good knowledge, and a positive\\n      attitude were significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. To enhance the\\n      COVID-19 vaccine uptake, the government should improve the knowledge and attitude\\n      of pregnant women toward the COVID-19 vaccine.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Chekol Abebe, Ayalew Tiruneh, Asmare Adela, Mengie Ayele,\\n      Tilahun Muche, Behaile T/Mariam, Tilahun Mulu, Abebe Zewde, Dagnaw Baye and\\n      Asmamaw Dejenie.\\nFAU - Chekol Abebe, Endeshaw\\nAU  - Chekol Abebe E\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Debre Tabor\\n      University, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia.\\nFAU - Ayalew Tiruneh, Gebrehiwot\\nAU  - Ayalew Tiruneh G\\nAD  - Department of Midwifery, College of Health Sciences, Debre Tabor University,\\n      Debre Tabor, Ethiopia.\\nFAU - Asmare Adela, Getachew\\nAU  - Asmare Adela G\\nAD  - Department of Reproductive Health and Nutrition, School of Public Health, Woliata\\n      Sodo University, Woliata Sodo, Ethiopia.\\nFAU - Mengie Ayele, Teklie\\nAU  - Mengie Ayele T\\nAD  - Department of Pharmacy, College of Health Sciences, Debre Tabor University, Debre\\n      Tabor, Ethiopia.\\nFAU - Tilahun Muche, Zelalem\\nAU  - Tilahun Muche Z\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Debre Tabor\\n      University, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia.\\nFAU - Behaile T/Mariam, Awgichew\\nAU  - Behaile T/Mariam A\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Debre Tabor\\n      University, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia.\\nFAU - Tilahun Mulu, Anemut\\nAU  - Tilahun Mulu A\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Debre Tabor\\n      University, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia.\\nFAU - Abebe Zewde, Edgeit\\nAU  - Abebe Zewde E\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Debre Tabor\\n      University, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia.\\nFAU - Dagnaw Baye, Nega\\nAU  - Dagnaw Baye N\\nAD  - Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Debre Tabor\\n      University, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia.\\nFAU - Asmamaw Dejenie, Tadesse\\nAU  - Asmamaw Dejenie T\\nAD  - Department of Medical Biochemistry, College of Medicine and Health Sciences,\\n      University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Public Health\\nJT  - Frontiers in public health\\nJID - 101616579\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9343782\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - COVID-19 vaccine uptake\\nOT  - Northwest Ethiopia\\nOT  - associated factors\\nOT  - health institutions\\nOT  - pregnant women\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:12\\nPHST- 2022/05/12 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/24 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:12 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.919494 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Public Health. 2022 Jul 19;10:919494. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2022.919494.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928482\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2296-2565 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2296-2565 (Linking)\\nVI  - 10\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Willingness to pay for social health insurance among public civil servants: A\\n      cross-sectional study in Dessie City Administration, North-East Ethiopia.\\nPG  - 920502\\nLID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.920502 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: The readiness to pay for health insurance has an impact on universal \\n      health care.

Even up to 40% of morphologically \\n      normal embryos harbour aneuploidies. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is a\\n      technology, which gives opportunity to identify euploid embryos before\\n      implantation. Aims: This study seeks to determine the role of PGT in poor\\n      prognosis patients, i.e., patients with advanced maternal age (AMA) (maternal age\\n      >/=35 years), recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) (miscarriages >/=2) and recurrent\\n      implantation failures (RIFs) (in vitro fertilisation failures >/=3). Study\\n      Setting and Design: A retrospective case-control study was done on a group of\\n      patients who underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection for the indications of\\n      AMA, RPL and RIF. Materials and Methods: In 33 cases who opted for PGT, day 5\\n      blastocysts were subjected to trophectoderm biopsy with the help of\\n      next-generation sequencing. Euploid blastocyst was transferred in hormone\\n      replacement cycle at a later date. In 154 controls, blastocyst transfer was done \\n      based on morphological grading. Pregnancy outcomes are compared in terms of\\n      implantation rate, pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate. \\n      Statistical Analysis: Chi-square test was used for comparisons between the study \\n      groups with respect to percentage. P < 0.05 was considered statistically\\n      significant. Results: The highest aneuploidy rate was found in embryos with AMA. \\n      Implantation rate was found to be statistically significantly higher in the PGT\\n      group as compared to the non-PGT group. However, take-home baby rates were not\\n      improved by PGT. There were less number of mean embryos transferred in the PGT\\n      group and lower multiple pregnancy rate. Conclusions: With the application of\\n      PGT, embryo selection rates and implantation rates improved in poor prognosis\\n      patients.\\nCI  - Copyright: (c) 2022 Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences.\\nFAU - Singh, Pooja Nadkarni\\nAU  - Singh PN\\nAD  - Nimaaya Women\\'s Centre for Health, Surat, Gujarat, India.\\nFAU - Pathak, Akanksha Mahajan\\nAU  - Pathak AM\\nAD  - Nimaaya Women\\'s Centre for Health, Surat, Gujarat, India.\\nFAU - Singh, Prabhakar\\nAU  - Singh P\\nAD  - Nimaaya Women\\'s Centre for Health, Surat, Gujarat, India.\\nFAU - Desai, Meha\\nAU  - Desai M\\nAD  - Nimaaya Women\\'s Centre for Health, Surat, Gujarat, India.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220630\\nPL  - India\\nTA  - J Hum Reprod Sci\\nJT  - Journal of human reproductive sciences\\nJID - 101473512\\nPMC - PMC9345270\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Advanced maternal age\\nOT  - next-generation sequencing\\nOT  - preimplantation genetic testing\\nOT  - recurrent implantation failure\\nOT  - recurrent pregnancy loss\\nCOIS- There are no conflicts of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:11\\nPHST- 2021/11/18 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/03/27 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/05/02 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:11 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.4103/jhrs.jhrs_166_21 [doi]\\nAID - JHRS-15-157 [pii]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - J Hum Reprod Sci. 2022 Apr-Jun;15(2):157-162. doi: 10.4103/jhrs.jhrs_166_21.

With the gradual\\n      emergence of data showing near minimal effects of the virus on pregnancy,\\n      Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) services were gradually resumed following \\n      guidelines and advisories. Aim: The purpose of this study was to detect the COVID\\n      positivity rate in women undergoing ART treatment during the COVID pandemic and\\n      compare clinical and embryological outcomes to the ART cycles performed in the\\n      pre-COVID era. Study Setting and Design: This was a retrospective cohort study of\\n      all women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by a fresh or\\n      frozen embryo transfer (ET) between 1st October 2019 and 31st March 2020 (control\\n      group) and between 1st April 2020 and 31st September 2020 (study group) at Nova\\n      IVF Fertility Clinic, Ahmedabad. Material and Methods: The study group underwent \\n      ART during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India and when gradual\\n      unlocking of facilities including ART was advised as per the national ART\\n      advisory by the ICMR in December 2020. The outcomes were compared with the\\n      control group (cycles in pre-covid time). Statistical Analysis: Statistical\\n      analysis was performed in SPSS (v25.0) and included Mann-Whitney U, Fisher\\'s\\n      exact and Pearson Chi-square as appropriate. Values of P < 0.05 were considered\\n      statistically significant. Results: A total of 367 in vitro fertilisation (IVF)\\n      stimulations were initiated. A total of 342 retrievals and 606 ETs (171 fresh and\\n      435 frozen) were completed during the study period with a COVID positivity rate\\n      of 6.8% (25/367) amongst fresh and 3.9% (18/453) amongst frozen ETs,\\n      respectively; the PR and IR in the study group was similar to the control group\\n      (47.6 vs. 55.1 P = 0.4 and 68.7 vs. 66.4; P = 0.52, respectively). The maternal\\n      complication rates were similar in both groups with a COVID positivity rate of\\n      10.2% (23/225) and 1 maternal death in the study group. The live birth rates were\\n      similar. Conclusions: We did not find a noteworthy difference in the clinical and\\n      embryological outcomes in the IVF cycles conducted in the COVID era as compared\\n      to the pre-COVID time. Thus, with adequate precautions and safety measures, ART\\n      services conducted during the COVID pandemic have comparable birth outcomes and\\n      can be safely advocated.\\nCI  - Copyright: (c) 2022 Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences.\\nFAU - Banker, Manish\\nAU  - Banker M\\nAD  - Department of Reproductive Medicine, Nova IVF Fertility, Ahmedabad, Gujarat,\\n      India.\\nFAU - Arora, Parul\\nAU  - Arora P\\nAD  - Department of Reproductive Medicine, Nova IVF Fertility, Ahmedabad, Gujarat,\\n      India.\\nFAU - Banker, Jwal\\nAU  - Banker J\\nAD  - Department of Reproductive Medicine, Nova IVF Fertility, Ahmedabad, Gujarat,\\n      India.\\nFAU - Shah, Anand\\nAU  - Shah A\\nAD  - Department of Medicine, Unit 1, SVP General Hospital, Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad,\\n      Gujarat, India.\\nFAU - Gupta, Reena\\nAU  - Gupta R\\nAD  - Department of Reproductive Medicine, Nova IVF Fertility, New Delhi, India.\\nFAU - Shah, Sandeep\\nAU  - Shah S\\nAD  - Department of Reproductive Medicine, Nova IVF Fertility, Ahmedabad, Gujarat,\\n      India.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220630\\nPL  - India\\nTA  - J Hum Reprod Sci\\nJT  - Journal of human reproductive sciences\\nJID - 101473512\\nPMC - PMC9345275\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Assisted reproductive techniques\\nOT  - COVID 19\\nOT  - in vitro fertilisation\\nOT  - lockdown\\nOT  - pandemic\\nOT  - pregnancy\\nCOIS- Dr. Manish Banker is currently an associate editor of the Journal of Human\\n      Reproductive Sciences.

Aims: To explore the relationships of IVF success and \\n      pregnancy outcomes with maternal serum levels of TSH (at both preconception and\\n      12-week IVF-conceived pregnancy). Also, to confirm or refute the recommended TSH \\n      level </=2.5muIU/mL. Study Setting and Design: Retrospective cohort. Material and\\n      Methods: 158 IVF-conceived pregnant women and 117 age-matched controls\\n      non-pregnant (</=39years, BMI 18.5-38kg/m2) were recruited. Preconception and\\n      12-week IVF-conceived pregnancy serum samples were analysed for reproductive\\n      hormones, fasting glucose, insulin and TSH levels. Data of pregnant women at 28\\n      weeks for GDM screening (75-gram OGTT) and up until delivery were included.\\n      Statistical Analysis: Binary logistic regression used to predict association\\n      between preconception TSH levels and IVF success, and pregnancy outcomes.\\n      Association of delta change of hormones was determined with linear regression.\\n      Significance level P</=0.05 with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Overall, \\n      median (IQR) age was 32(6)years, BMI 25.4(6.9)kg/m2, HbA1c 5.2(0.52)% and TSH\\n      1.82(1.4)muIU/mL. There was no significant association between preconception TSH \\n      level and IVF success rate. During the first trimester of IVF-conceived\\n      pregnancy, delta change in TSH level was associated with that of progesterone\\n      (P=0.03). 12-week gestation TSH level did not predict adverse pregnancy outcomes \\n      (i.e. onset of GDM, delivery type and premature delivery); but a higher TSH level\\n      predicted earlier delivery in weeks. There was a higher risk of delivery by\\n      caesarean section when TSH>2.5muIU/mL. Conclusion: Variation of maternal TSH\\n      within normal range (0.4-4.0muIU/mL) at preconception and 12-week gestation has\\n      no predictive effect on IVF success and pregnancy outcomes in IVF-pregnancy. Our \\n      data provide no support for a recommended preconception TSH level </=2.5muIU/mL\\n      in IVF-conceived pregnancy, but rather promote a preconception TSH level within\\n      normal range.\\nCI  - Copyright: (c) 2022 Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences.\\nFAU - Coussa, Ayla\\nAU  - Coussa A\\nAD  - Division of Biomedical Sciences (T.M.B.), Warwick Medical School, University of\\n      Warwick, Clinical Sciences Research Laboratories, University Hospitals Coventry\\n      and Warwickshire, Clifford Bridge Road, Coventry, CV2 2DX, United Kingdom.\\nFAU - Barber, Thomas M\\nAU  - Barber TM\\nAD  - Division of Biomedical Sciences (T.M.B.), Warwick Medical School, University of\\n      Warwick, Clinical Sciences Research Laboratories, University Hospitals Coventry\\n      and Warwickshire, Clifford Bridge Road, Coventry, CV2 2DX, United Kingdom.\\nFAU - Khrait, Zakwan\\nAU  - Khrait Z\\nAD  - Fakih IVF Fertility Center, Jumeirah, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\\nFAU - Cheaib, Samer\\nAU  - Cheaib S\\nAD  - Fakih IVF Fertility Center, Jumeirah, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\\nFAU - Hasan, Hayder A\\nAU  - Hasan HA\\nAD  - Department of Clinical Nutrition & Dietetics, University of Sharjah, Muwailih,\\n      Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220601\\nPL  - India\\nTA  - J Hum Reprod Sci\\nJT  - Journal of human reproductive sciences\\nJID - 101473512\\nPMC - PMC9345284\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Gestational hypothyroidism\\nOT  - in vitro fertilisation\\nOT  - in vitro fertilisation-pregnancy\\nOT  - pregnancy\\nOT  - thyroid disease\\nOT  - thyroid-stimulating hormone\\nCOIS- There are no conflicts of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:11\\nPHST- 2021/11/20 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/03/09 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/03/12 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:11 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.4103/jhrs.jhrs_168_21 [doi]\\nAID - JHRS-15-163 [pii]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - J Hum Reprod Sci. 2022 Apr-Jun;15(2):163-170. doi: 10.4103/jhrs.jhrs_168_21.

Ejaculatory abstinence (EA) certainly can influence \\n      sperm quality such as volume, count, motility and morphology. However, very few\\n      studies have addressed the influence of EA on intracytoplasmic sperm injection\\n      (ICSI) outcome and especially in males with severe oligo-asthenoteratozoospermia \\n      (OAT) syndrome. Aim: This study was undertaken with the purpose of evaluating the\\n      advantage of shorter abstinence period (1-h sequential ejaculation) in males with\\n      severe OAT syndrome on total usable embryo rate and thereby emphasising the\\n      potential application of consecutive ejaculate. Study Setting and Design: This\\n      retrospective cohort study consisted of all the infertile couples undergoing ICSI\\n      cycle with the indicated seminal characteristics who had consulted the tertiary\\n      care hospital between January 2021 and July 2021.

Retrospectively, two groups\\n      were analysed, i.e., Group A with 56 subjects in which first semen sample was\\n      used for ICSI cycle and another Group B with 41 subjects in which second semen\\n      sample collected within a shorter abstinence period of 1 h was used. Statistical \\n      Analysis: The data were descriptively analysed using GraphPad Prism (vs. 9.2).\\n      Unpaired t-test and analysis of variance test were used to determine the\\n      significance. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The age\\n      of female subjects in Group A was 29.9 +/- 3.5 years while it was 29.4 +/- 3.4\\n      years in Group B. Similarly, the age of male subjects was 32.2 +/- 3.6 years and \\n      31.9 +/- 4.1 years in Group A and Group B, respectively, with no statistical\\n      differences in any gender between the groups (P > 0.05). Apart from initial\\n      progressive motility (P = 0.004), none of the parameters such as total volume,\\n      total sperm count and morphology were significantly different (P > 0.05) between \\n      Group A and samples of Group B. Similarly, parameters such as volume (P = 0.006) \\n      and post-wash motility (P < 0.001) were significantly different between Group A\\n      and samples of Group B. However, there was no significant difference in sperm\\n      count and morphology (P > 0.05). Grade 1 embryos on day 3 were 345 (62.8%) in\\n      Group A and 170 (54.3%) in Group B. Overall, the total usable embryos in Group A \\n      and Group B were 222 (40.4%) and 148 (47.3%), respectively (P > 0.05).\\n      Conclusion: With regard to compromised sperm parameters, our findings do suggest \\n      that the second ejaculate is quite relevant to \\'in vitro\\' reproductive treatments\\n      and a simple request for a second consecutive ejaculate (shorter abstinence\\n      period of 1 h) could provide the same results in terms of fertilisation. We\\n      observed the increased chances of usable embryos in the second ejaculate group.\\nCI  - Copyright: (c) 2022 Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences.\\nFAU - Patel, Deven V\\nAU  - Patel DV\\nAD  - Department of IVF, Sunflower Women\\'s Hospital, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.\\nFAU - Patel, Trupti\\nAU  - Patel T\\nAD  - Department of IVF, Sunflower Women\\'s Hospital, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.\\nFAU - Maheshwari, Naroda\\nAU  - Maheshwari N\\nAD  - Department of Clinical, Sunflower Women\\'s Hospital, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.\\nFAU - Soni, Shradha\\nAU  - Soni S\\nAD  - Department of Clinical, Sunflower Women\\'s Hospital, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.\\nFAU - Patel, R G\\nAU  - Patel RG\\nAD  - Department of Clinical, Sunflower Women\\'s Hospital, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220630\\nPL  - India\\nTA  - J Hum Reprod Sci\\nJT  - Journal of human reproductive sciences\\nJID - 101473512\\nPMC - PMC9345271\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Ejaculatory abstinence\\nOT  - infertility\\nOT  - intracytoplasmic sperm injection\\nOT  - severe oligo-asthenoteratozoospermia\\nCOIS- There are no conflicts of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:11\\nPHST- 2022/03/29 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/15 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/06/17 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:11 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.4103/jhrs.jhrs_46_22 [doi]\\nAID - JHRS-15-138 [pii]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - J Hum Reprod Sci. 2022 Apr-Jun;15(2):138-142. doi: 10.4103/jhrs.jhrs_46_22.

Aims: The aim of the\\n      present study is to assess the efficiency of MF and to isolate the best\\n      spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) over the density gradient\\n      (DG) technique. Study Setting and Design: We recruited couples who choose the\\n      oocyte donation programme for this study to eliminate confounding factors\\n      associated with oocyte quality. Materials and Methods: Sperm was processed by MF \\n      (n = 180) and DG (n = 151). ICSI was performed and positive pregnancy,\\n      miscarriage and clinical pregnancy rates were compared. Statistical Analysis: All\\n      variables were analysed using Graph Pad Prism 5. The unpaired two-tailed t-test\\n      was used to assess the significance.

Several\\n      variants in ER-alpha (ERalpha) and ER-beta (ERbeta) have been linked to\\n      depression, but the results were not consistent. Hence, we conducted a\\n      meta-analysis to evaluate the association between ERalpha/ERbeta and depression\\n      in a cohort of women. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in\\n      public databases. The genetic association between polymorphisms in Eralpha/ERbeta\\n      and depression risk in a cohort of women was evaluated by odds ratios (ORs) and\\n      95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cochran\\'s Q test and the I(2) index were used to \\n      evaluate heterogeneity. Results: In total, 10 studies and 4 SNPs (rs2234693,\\n      rs9340799, rs4986938, rs1256049) were included in our meta-analysis. rs2234693\\n      genotype was significantly associated with the risk of depression in women by\\n      dominant model (CC + CT vs TT, OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.09-1.55, p = 0.0031),\\n      recessive model (CC vs CT + TT, OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.00-2.67, p = 0.0478),\\n      additive model (CC vs TT, OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.12-3.35, p = 0.0189) and allelic\\n      model (C vs T, OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10-1.39, p = 0.0003). For rs9340799, the\\n      frequencies of risk genotypes according to the dominant (GG + GA vs AA, OR =\\n      1.47, 95% CI = 1.10-1.98, p = 0.0096, I(2) = 0%, p = 0.43) and allelic (G vs A,\\n      OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04-1.69, p = 0.0236, I(2) = 0%, p = 0.39) models were\\n      significantly lower in women with depression than in controls within the Asian\\n      subgroup. For rs1256049, risk genotypes were significantly more frequent in\\n      depressed subjects than in controls under the dominant model (AA+ GA vs GG, OR = \\n      1.62, 95% CI: 1.19-2.21, p = 0.0024) and the allelic model (A vs G, OR = 1.35,\\n      95% CI: 1.07-1.72, p = 0.012) after sensitivity analysis by omitting one study\\n      which induce the heterogeneity. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis is the\\n      first and most comprehensive investigation of the association between ERs and\\n      depression in women, and the findings support the concept that ERs participate in\\n      the etiology of sex heterogeneity in depression.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Li, Xie, Wang, Liu, Liao, Yin and Huang.\\nFAU - Li, Cuifen\\nAU  - Li C\\nAD  - Department of Gynecology, Songshan Lake Central Hospital of Dongguan City,\\n      Dongguan, China.\\nFAU - Xie, Manli\\nAU  - Xie M\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Qingxi Hospital of Dongguan City,\\n      Dongguan, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Weiwei\\nAU  - Wang W\\nAD  - Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Yanyan\\nAU  - Liu Y\\nAD  - Department of Gynecology, Songshan Lake Central Hospital of Dongguan City,\\n      Dongguan, China.\\nFAU - Liao, Dan\\nAU  - Liao D\\nAD  - Department of Gynecology, Songshan Lake Central Hospital of Dongguan City,\\n      Dongguan, China.\\nFAU - Yin, Jingwen\\nAU  - Yin J\\nAD  - Department of Psychiatry, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University,\\n      Zhanjiang, China.\\nFAU - Huang, Hao\\nAU  - Huang H\\nAD  - Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical\\n      University, Zhanjiang, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Genet\\nJT  - Frontiers in genetics\\nJID - 101560621\\nPMC - PMC9343944\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - ERalpha\\nOT  - Erbeta\\nOT  - depression\\nOT  - polymorphism\\nOT  - women\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:11\\nPHST- 2022/05/05 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/21 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:11 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.936296 [doi]\\nAID - 936296 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Genet. 2022 Jul 19;13:936296. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2022.936296. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928449\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1664-8021 (Print)\\nIS  - 1664-8021 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Identification and Validation of an m6A Modification of JAK-STAT Signaling\\n      Pathway-Related Prognostic Prediction Model in Gastric Cancer.\\nPG  - 891744\\nLID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.891744 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the malignant tumors worldwide. Janus\\n      (JAK)-signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway\\n      is involved in cellular biological process and immune function. However, the\\n      association between them is still not systematically described. Therefore, in\\n      this study, we aimed to identify key genes involved in JAK-STAT signaling pathway\\n      and GC, as well as the potential mechanism. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas\\n      (TCGA) database was the source of RNA-sequencing data of GC patients. Gene\\n      Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used as the validation set. The predictive \\n      value of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway-related prognostic prediction model was\\n      examined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO); survival,\\n      univariate, and multivariate Cox regression analyses; and receiver operating\\n      characteristic curve (ROC) analyses to examine the predictive value of the model.\\n      Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and chi-square test\\n      were used to verify the expression of genes in the model and assess the\\n      association between the genes and clinicopathological parameters of GC patients, \\n      respectively. Then, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes\\n      (KEGG), gene set enrichment analysis, version 3.0 (GSEA), sequence-based RNA\\n      adenosine methylation site predictor (SRAMP) online websites, and RNA\\n      immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments were used to predict the model-related\\n      potential pathways, m6A modifications, and the association between model genes\\n      and m6A. Results: A four-gene prognostic model (GHR, PIM1, IFNA8, and IFNB1) was \\n      constructed, namely, riskScore. The Kaplan-Meier curves suggested that patients\\n      with high riskScore expression had a poorer prognosis than those with low\\n      riskScore expression (p = 0.006). Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed\\n      that the model could be an independent predictor (p < 0.001; HR = 3.342, 95%, CI \\n      = 1.834-6.088). The 5-year area under time-dependent ROC curve (AUC) reached\\n      0.655. The training test set verified these results. Further analyses unveiled an\\n      enrichment of cancer-related pathways, m6A modifications, and the direct\\n      interaction between m6A and the four genes. Conclusion: This four-gene prognostic\\n      model could be applied to predict the prognosis of GC patients and might be a\\n      promising therapeutic target in GC.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Jiang, Chen, Shen and Shen.\\nFAU - Jiang, Fei\\nAU  - Jiang F\\nAD  - Key Laboratory of Environmental Medical Engineering and Education Ministry,\\n      Nanjing Public Health College, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.\\nAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health,\\n      Southeast University, Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Xiaowei\\nAU  - Chen X\\nAD  - Key Laboratory of Environmental Medical Engineering and Education Ministry,\\n      Nanjing Public Health College, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.\\nAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health,\\n      Southeast University, Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Shen, Yan\\nAU  - Shen Y\\nAD  - Key Laboratory of Environmental Medical Engineering and Education Ministry,\\n      Nanjing Public Health College, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.\\nAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health,\\n      Southeast University, Nanjing, China.\\nFAU - Shen, Xiaobing\\nAU  - Shen X\\nAD  - Key Laboratory of Environmental Medical Engineering and Education Ministry,\\n      Nanjing Public Health College, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.\\nAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health,\\n      Southeast University, Nanjing, China.\\nAD  - Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health,\\n      Southeast University, Nanjing, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Genet\\nJT  - Frontiers in genetics\\nJID - 101560621\\nPMC - PMC9343854\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - M6A\\nOT  - TCGA\\nOT  - gastric cancer\\nOT  - mRNA\\nOT  - prognosis\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:11\\nPHST- 2022/03/08 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/13 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:11 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.891744 [doi]\\nAID - 891744 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Genet. 2022 Jul 19;13:891744. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2022.891744. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928448\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1664-8021 (Print)\\nIS  - 1664-8021 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - RPP30 is a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer.\\nPG  - 888051\\nLID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.888051 [doi]\\nAB  - Objective: This study aimed to identify the hub gene in gastric cancer (GC)\\n      tumorigenesis. A biomarker prediction model was constructed and analyzed, and\\n      protein expression in histopathological samples was verified in a validation\\n      cohort. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from GC\\n      projects in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Functional enrichment\\n      analysis of DEGs was performed between the high- and low- Ribonuclease P protein \\n      subunit p30 (RPP30) expression groups. ROC analysis was performed to assess RPP30\\n      expression to discriminate GC from normal tissues. Functional enrichment pathways\\n      and immune infiltration of DEGs were analyzed using GSEA and ssGSEA. Survival\\n      analysis and nomogram construction were performed to predict patient survival.\\n      Immunohistochemical staining of GC tissues was performed to validate RPP30\\n      expression in GC and paracancerous samples. Results: Gene expression data and\\n      clinical information of 380 cases (375 GC samples and 32 para-cancerous tissues) \\n      were collected from TCGA database. The AUC for RPP30 expression was found to be\\n      0.785. The G alpha S signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched\\n      signaling pathway. Primary therapy outcome (p < 0.001, HR = 0.243, 95% CI =\\n      0.156-0.379), age (p = 0.012, HR = 1.748, 95% CI = 1.133-2.698), and RPP30\\n      expression (p < 0.001, HR = 2.069, 95% CI = 1.346-3.181) were identified as\\n      independent prognostic factors. As a quantitative approach, a nomogram\\n      constructed based on RPP30 expression, age, and primary therapy outcome performed\\n      well in predicting patient survival. Nineteen of the 25 tissue samples from the\\n      validation cohort showed positive RPP30 expression in GC tissues, whereas 16\\n      cases showed negative RPP30 staining in normal tissues.

Recently, the\\n      mutations in ubiquitin-associated protein 1 (UBAP1) have been described in\\n      patients with HSP, known as spastic paraplegias 80 (SPG80). Here, we reported a\\n      Chinese HSP family presenting a frameshift mutation in the UBAP1 gene leading to \\n      complex HSP. Their clinical features encompassed spastic paraparetic gait,\\n      exaggerated patellar tendon reflexes, bilateral Babinski signs, and hyperactive\\n      Achilles tendon reflex. The proband also had severe urinary incontinence and a\\n      dermoid cyst at the lumbar 4-5 spinal cord, which rarely occurs in HSP patients. \\n      Following whole-exome sequencing, a novel heterozygous mutation (c.437dupG,\\n      NM_016,525) was identified in the UBAP1 that segregated with the family\\'s\\n      phenotype and resulted in truncating UBAP1 protein (p.Ser146ArgfsTer13).\\n      Moreover, we reviewed the genotypes of UBAP1 and the phenotypic variability in 90\\n      HSP patients reported in the literature. We found that the age of onset in\\n      UBAP1-related patients was juvenile, and there were population differences in the\\n      age of onset. The main complications were lower extremity spasticity,\\n      hyperreflexia, and the Babinski sign. Exon 4 of UBAP1 was identified as a\\n      mutation hotspot region. Our study expands the knowledge of UBAP1 mutations,\\n      which will aid in HSP patient counseling. Further molecular biological research\\n      is needed to explore the genotype-phenotype correlations of UBAP1-related HSP.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Li, Huang, Chai, Zhu, Huang, Ma, Zhang and Xie.\\nFAU - Li, Peiqiang\\nAU  - Li P\\nAD  - Institute of Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University,\\n      Lanzhou, China.\\nFAU - Huang, Xiande\\nAU  - Huang X\\nAD  - Department of Urology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, China.\\nFAU - Chai, Senmao\\nAU  - Chai S\\nAD  - Institute of Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University,\\n      Lanzhou, China.\\nFAU - Zhu, Dalin\\nAU  - Zhu D\\nAD  - Medical Imaging Center, Gansu Province Maternal and Child-care Hospital, Lanzhou,\\n      China.\\nFAU - Huang, Huirong\\nAU  - Huang H\\nAD  - Department of Respiratory Medicine, Lanzhou University Second Hospital, Lanzhou, \\n      China.\\nFAU - Ma, Fengdie\\nAU  - Ma F\\nAD  - Institute of Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University,\\n      Lanzhou, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Shasha\\nAU  - Zhang S\\nAD  - Institute of Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University,\\n      Lanzhou, China.\\nFAU - Xie, Xiaodong\\nAU  - Xie X\\nAD  - Institute of Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University,\\n      Lanzhou, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Case Reports\\nDEP - 20220714\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Genet\\nJT  - Frontiers in genetics\\nJID - 101560621\\nPMC - PMC9344137\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - UBAP1\\nOT  - case report\\nOT  - hereditary spastic paraplegia\\nOT  - novel mutation\\nOT  - whole-exome sequencing\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:11\\nPHST- 2022/05/05 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/27 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:11 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.936292 [doi]\\nAID - 936292 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Genet. 2022 Jul 14;13:936292. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2022.936292. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928436\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2405-8440 (Print)\\nIS  - 2405-8440 (Linking)\\nVI  - 8\\nIP  - 6\\nDP  - 2022 Jun\\nTI  - Development and optimization of cactus pear fruit jelly supplemented with Moringa\\n      oleifera leaf extract.\\nPG  - e09587\\nLID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09587 [doi]\\nAB  - Cactus pear fruit and Moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam) are nutritionally abundant\\n      food sources.

These studies differ in terms of\\n      their experimental conditions, and in the present work we have attempted to\\n      summarize previous observations in a quantitative, data-driven systematic review.\\n      A meta-analysis of quantitative data gathered across 43 relevant studies revealed\\n      the overall significance of the proposed treatments and evaluated the impact of\\n      different experimental conditions on the outcome of antitranspirants, delayed\\n      pruning and late source limitation. Antitranspirants were most effective when\\n      applied twice and closer to veraison, while di-1-p-menthene increased the\\n      ripening delay by about 1 degrees Brix compared to kaolin. Larger ripening delays\\n      were achieved with delayed pruning of low-yielding vines or by pruning at later\\n      stages of apical bud development. Late defoliation or shoot trimming delayed\\n      ripening in high-yielding vines and represent suitable solutions for\\n      late-harvested varieties, but became ineffective where the treatment decreased\\n      yield.

The purpose of this study is to assess whether the\\n      addition of seasonality to a validated geriatric inpatient mortality risk tool\\n      will improve the predictive capacity and risk stratification for geriatric hip\\n      fracture patients. We hypothesize that seasonality will improve the predictive\\n      capacity. Methodology Between October 2014 and August 2021, 2,421 patients\\n      >55-year-old treated for hip fracture were analyzed for demographics, date of\\n      presentation, COVID-19 status (for patients after February 2020), and mortality. \\n      Patients were grouped by season based on their admission dates into the following\\n      four cohorts: fall (September-November), winter (December-February), spring\\n      (March-May), and summer (June-August). Patients presenting during the fall/winter\\n      and spring/summer were compared. The baseline Score for Trauma Triage in the\\n      Geriatric and Middle-Aged (STTGMA) tool for hip fractures (STTGMAHIP_FX_SCORE)\\n      and the seasonality iteration (STTGMA_SEASON) were also compared. Sub-analysis\\n      was conducted on 687 patients between February 2020 and August 2021 amid the\\n      COVID-19 pandemic. The baseline score (STTGMAHIP_FX_SCORE) and the COVID-19\\n      iteration (STTGMACOVID_ORIGINAL_2020) were modified to include seasonality\\n      (STTGMA_COVID/SEASON). Patients were stratified by risk score and compared. The\\n      predictive ability of the models was compared using DeLong\\'s test. Results For\\n      the overall cohort, patients who presented during the fall/winter had a higher\\n      rate of inpatient mortality (2.87% vs. 1.25%, p < 0.01). STTGMA_SEASON improved\\n      the predictive capacity for inpatient mortality compared to STTGMAHIP_FX_SCORE\\n      but not significantly (0.773 vs. 0.672, p = 0.105) On sub-analysis, regression\\n      weighting showed a coefficient of 0.643, with fall and winter having a greater\\n      absolute effect size (fall = 2.572, winter = 1.929, spring = 1.286, summer =\\n      0.643). STTGMA_COVID/SEASON improved the predictive capacity for inpatient\\n      mortality compared to STTGMAHIP_FX_SCORE (0.882 vs. 0.581, p < 0.01) and\\n      STTGMACOVID_ORIGINAL_2020 (0.882 vs. 0.805, p = 0.04). The highest risk quartile \\n      contained 89.5% of patients who expired during their index inpatient\\n      hospitalization (p < 0.01) and 68.2% of patients who died within 30 days of\\n      discharge (p < 0.01). Conclusions Seasonality may play a role in both the\\n      incidence and impact of COVID-19 and additional respiratory infections. Including\\n      seasonality improves the predictive capacity and risk stratification of the\\n      STTGMA tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. This allows for effective triage and\\n      closer surveillance of high-risk geriatric hip fracture patients by better\\n      accounting for the increased respiratory infection incidence and the associated\\n      mortality risk seen during fall and winter.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022, Esper et al.\\nFAU - Esper, Garrett W\\nAU  - Esper GW\\nAD  - Orthopedic Surgery, New York University Langone Health, New York, USA.\\nAD  - Orthopedic Surgery, State University of New York Upstate Medical University,\\n      Syracuse, USA.\\nFAU - Meltzer-Bruhn, Ariana T\\nAU  - Meltzer-Bruhn AT\\nAD  - Medical School, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine,\\n      Philadelphia, USA.\\nAD  - Orthopedic Surgery, New York University Langone Health, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Ganta, Abhishek\\nAU  - Ganta A\\nAD  - Orthopedic Surgery, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, New York, USA.\\nAD  - Orthopedic Surgery, New York University Langone Health, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Egol, Kenneth A\\nAU  - Egol KA\\nAD  - Orthopedic Surgery, New York University Langone Health, New York, USA.\\nAD  - Orthopedic Surgery, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, New York, USA.\\nFAU - Konda, Sanjit R\\nAU  - Konda SR\\nAD  - Orthopaedic Surgery, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, New York, USA.\\nAD  - Orthopedic Surgery, New York University Langone Health, New York, USA.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220703\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Cureus\\nJT  - Cureus\\nJID - 101596737\\nPMC - PMC9345382\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - covid-19\\nOT  - geriatric\\nOT  - hip fracture\\nOT  - risk stratification\\nOT  - seasonality\\nCOIS- The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:10\\nPHST- 2022/07/01 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:10 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.7759/cureus.26530 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Cureus. 2022 Jul 3;14(7):e26530. doi: 10.7759/cureus.26530. eCollection 2022 Jul.\\n\\nPMID- 35928386\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 0918-5739 (Print)\\nIS  - 0918-5739 (Linking)\\nVI  - 31\\nIP  - 3\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Goiter in a 6-year-old patient with novel thyroglobulin gene variant (Gly145Glu) \\n      causing intracellular thyroglobulin transport disorder: Correlation between\\n      goiter size and the free T3 to free T4 ratio.\\nPG  - 185-191\\nLID - 10.1297/cpe.2022-0006 [doi]\\nAB  - Thyroglobulin gene abnormalities cause thyroid dyshormonogenesis.

A particular checklist was\\n      provided to patients, which consisted of demographic data, pachymetry test,\\n      keratometry, refractive error, corneal-thickness indices, and corneal surface\\n      area indices. The data were analysed using the statistical analysis package of\\n      IBM((R)) V25. The mean age of the participants in this study was 28.48+/-6.82\\n      years, and the ratio of women to men was 66.4%.

High myopes had significantly higher Kmax front than low\\n      myopes (P=0.00). In astigmatism patients, the Kmax in front of the cornea in\\n      extreme type was significantly higher than in moderate (P=0.00) and high (P=0.01)\\n      types.

A total of 80 subjects were\\n      enrolled in this study and divided into two groups. The first group included 40\\n      women with spontaneous abortions aged between 18 and 40 years. The second group\\n      included 40 pregnant women without previous history of miscarriages. Total\\n      25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH-VD) measurement was estimated with a Dry Fluorescence\\n      Immunoassay analyzer using the Lansionbio LS-1100 instrument. The relationship\\n      between the five age groups and the vitamin D status of women with spontaneous\\n      abortion was not significant (p>0.05). There was no significant relationship\\n      between the miscarriage trimesters and vitamin D status (p>0.05) and between the \\n      five age groups (p>0.05). In our study, 95% of women with spontaneous abortion\\n      had vitamin D deficiency, compared to only 17.5% of pregnant women. A normal\\n      range of vitamin D improves the growth of the fetus and prevents pregnancy\\n      complications and miscarriage, promoting the growth of blood vessels in the\\n      placenta and improving the function of immune cells.\\nCI  - (c)2022 JOURNAL of MEDICINE and LIFE.\\nFAU - Kasim, Sumayah Faruq\\nAU  - Kasim SF\\nAD  - College of Health and Medical Technologies, Middle Technical University, Baghdad,\\n      Iraq.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nPL  - Romania\\nTA  - J Med Life\\nJT  - Journal of medicine and life\\nJID - 101477617\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9321502\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - abortion\\nOT  - miscarriage\\nOT  - pregnancy\\nOT  - vitamin D\\nOT  - vitamin D deficiency\\nCOIS- The author declares no conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:10\\nPHST- 2021/09/12 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/03/24 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:10 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.25122/jml-2021-0266 [doi]\\nAID - JMedLife-15-757 [pii]\\nPST - ppublish\\nSO  - J Med Life. 2022 Jun;15(6):757-761. doi: 10.25122/jml-2021-0266.\\n\\nPMID- 35928350\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1844-3117 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 1844-122X (Linking)\\nVI  - 15\\nIP  - 6\\nDP  - 2022 Jun\\nTI  - Self-efficacy among patients with hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nPG  - 797-804\\nLID - 10.25122/jml-2021-0405 [doi]\\nAB  - Patients with hemodialysis face various problems with self-care behavior.\\n      Therefore, these patients need to control and manage adherence to enhance\\n      self-care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has particularly high\\n      morbidity in the elderly and co-morbid peoples.

However, whether such differences are invariably the inevitable,\\n      unintended outcome of a legitimate process has yet to be determined. The European\\n      Committee on Organ Transplantation of the Council of Europe (CD-P-TO) is the\\n      committee that actively promotes the development of ethical, quality and safety\\n      standards in the field of transplantation in Europe. Whilst the ultimate\\n      objective is to shed light on the processes underlying potential gender\\n      inequities in transplantation, our initial goal was to represent the distribution\\n      by sex among organ donors and recipients in the CD-P-TO Member States and\\n      observer countries. Our survey confirms previous evidence that, in most\\n      countries, men represent the prevalent source of deceased donors (63.3% in 64\\n      countries: 60.7% and 71.9% for donation after brain and circulatory death,\\n      respectively). In contrast, women represent the leading source of organs\\n      recovered from living kidney and liver donors (61.1% and 51.2% in 55 and 32\\n      countries, respectively). Across countries, most recovered organs are\\n      transplanted into men (65% in 57 countries). These observations may be explained,\\n      at least in part, by the higher burden of certain diseases in men, childbearing\\n      related immune sensitization in women, and donor-recipient size mismatch. Future \\n      research should establish whether gender-related socially-constructed roles and\\n      socioeconomic status may play a detrimental role reducing the access of women to \\n      transplantation.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Cozzi, Alvarez, Carmona, Mahillo, Forsythe, Lomero,\\n      Lopez-Fraga, Sapir-Pichhadze, Cardillo and Dominguez-Gil.\\nFAU - Cozzi, Emanuele\\nAU  - Cozzi E\\nAD  - Centro Nazionale Trapianti-Istituto Superiore di Sanita (CNT-ISS), Rome, Italy.\\nAD  - Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, Transplant Immunology\\n      Unit, Padua University Hospital, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.\\nFAU - Alvarez, Marina\\nAU  - Alvarez M\\nAD  - Organizacion Nacional de Trasplantes (ONT), Madrid, Spain.\\nFAU - Carmona, Mar\\nAU  - Carmona M\\nAD  - Organizacion Nacional de Trasplantes (ONT), Madrid, Spain.\\nFAU - Mahillo, Beatriz\\nAU  - Mahillo B\\nAD  - Organizacion Nacional de Trasplantes (ONT), Madrid, Spain.\\nFAU - Forsythe, John\\nAU  - Forsythe J\\nAD  - NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), Bristol, United Kingdom.\\nFAU - Lomero, Mar\\nAU  - Lomero M\\nAD  - European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM), Council of\\n      Europe, Strasbourg, France.\\nFAU - Lopez-Fraga, Marta\\nAU  - Lopez-Fraga M\\nAD  - European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM), Council of\\n      Europe, Strasbourg, France.\\nFAU - Sapir-Pichhadze, Ruth\\nAU  - Sapir-Pichhadze R\\nAD  - Division of Nephrology and Multi-Organ Transplant Program, Department of\\n      Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.\\nFAU - Cardillo, Massimo\\nAU  - Cardillo M\\nAD  - Centro Nazionale Trapianti-Istituto Superiore di Sanita (CNT-ISS), Rome, Italy.\\nFAU - Dominguez-Gil, Beatriz\\nAU  - Dominguez-Gil B\\nAD  - Organizacion Nacional de Trasplantes (ONT), Madrid, Spain.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Transpl Int\\nJT  - Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ\\n      Transplantation\\nJID - 8908516\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9343585\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Council of Europe\\nOT  - donors\\nOT  - inequalities\\nOT  - recipients\\nOT  - sex\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:10\\nPHST- 2021/12/23 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/06 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:10 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/ti.2022.10322 [doi]\\nAID - 10322 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Transpl Int. 2022 Jul 19;35:10322. doi: 10.3389/ti.2022.10322. eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928335\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 0022-1058 (Print)\\nIS  - 0022-1058 (Linking)\\nVI  - 54\\nIP  - 2\\nDP  - 2022 Jun\\nTI  - Impact of the Cardioplegia Interval on Myocardial Protection Using the Modified\\n      St. Thomas Solution in Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Surgery: A Double-Center\\n      Study.\\nPG  - 135-141\\nLID - 10.1182/ject-135-141 [doi]\\nAB  - It has been reported that a single-dose cardioplegia interval is useful, but the \\n      safe interval doses are not clear. We aimed to investigate the impact of the\\n      cardioplegia interval on myocardial protection using the modified St. Thomas\\n      solution. We included consecutive isolated minimally invasive mitral\\n      valvuloplasty procedures (n = 229) performed at a hospital and medical center\\n      from January 2014 to December 2020. We compared postoperative peak creatine\\n      kinase MB and creatine kinase levels and other indicators between the short\\n      (Group S, n = 135; maximum myocardial protection interval <60 minutes) and long\\n      (Group L, n = 94; maximum myocardial protection interval >/=60 minutes) interval \\n      groups. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for confounders between the \\n      two groups. After propensity score matching, Groups S and L contained 47 patients\\n      each. Groups S and L did not differ significantly in peak creatine kinase MB\\n      (45.8 +/- 26.3 IU/L and 41.5 +/- 27.9 IU/L, respectively; p = .441) and creatine \\n      kinase levels (1,133 +/- 567 IU/L and 1,100 +/- 916 IU/L, respectively; p = .837)\\n      after admission to the intensive care unit on the day of surgery based on\\n      propensity score matching. In multivariate analysis, a cardioplegia dosing\\n      interval >/=60 minutes was not significantly associated with the maximum creatine\\n      kinase MB level after admission to the intensive care unit on the day of surgery \\n      (p = .354; 95% confidence interval: -1.67 to 4.65).

CSDH may be related to\\n      suidoku (fluid disturbance) from the Japanese herbal kampo perspective. Goreisan \\n      (GRS) treats suidoku and is used to prevent a postoperative recurrence. However, \\n      not all CSDHs are liquid, and some have structures such as trabecula, hematoma,\\n      and clots, suggesting oketsu (blood stasis). Therefore, we prospectively\\n      investigated the keishibukuryogan (KBG) effectiveness, which treats oketsu, for\\n      CSDH recurrence prevention and hematoma resolution compared to GRS. Methods: We\\n      prospectively prescribed KBG 7.5 g/day for 12 CSDH patients after burr-hole\\n      surgery. As a control cohort, we retrospectively collected 48 patients treated by\\n      GRS 7.5 g/day. The recurrence within 1 month and the hematoma thickness after 1\\n      month were evaluated. Results: The median age was 84 years old. All the patients\\'\\n      symptoms improved after surgery. The median preoperative midline shift and mean\\n      hematoma thicknesses were 6.0 mm and 23.75 mm. Those at 1 month were 2.0 mm and\\n      11.43 mm. The recurrence rate was not significantly different between the KBG\\n      cohort (1 of 12) and the GRS cohort (4 of 48) (P = 0.999). The KBG\\'s\\n      noninferiority to GRS regarding the hematoma thickness at 1 month was\\n      statistically proven; KBG (12.26 mm) and GRS (11.20 mm). Conclusion: The\\n      recurrence rate at 1 month was not different between the KBG and GRS cohorts.

Methods: Patients with a confirmed\\n      histological diagnosis of GB between January 2009 and June 2016 at a single\\n      center were retrospectively identified. The inclusion criteria for the study were\\n      age over 65 years at diagnosis, and surgical management with either a burr hole\\n      biopsy or craniotomy. Results: A total of n = 289 patients underwent surgery for \\n      GB, with a median age at diagnosis of 71 years, and of whom 64% were male.\\n      Craniotomies were performed in 71%, with burr hole biopsies performed in the\\n      remainder (29%).

On\\n      multivariable analysis, treatment with RT + TZM was significantly independently\\n      associated with longer patient survival (P < 0.001). Craniotomy was associated\\n      with a significant improvement in performance status, compared to burr hole\\n      biopsy (P = 0.006). For the subgroup of patients receiving TZM, those with a\\n      methylated O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) status had\\n      significantly longer overall survival than those with unmethylated MGMT (median: \\n      407 vs. 341 days, P = 0.039).

This article aims to evaluate exophthalmos\\' improvement in a surgical \\n      series without orbital reconstruction. Methods: We consecutively included all\\n      patients diagnosed with SOM, admitted to a single institution for 10 years.\\n      Surgical resection was the standard of care, associated or not with adjuvant\\n      radiation therapy. The radiological investigation included preoperative and\\n      postoperative head CT or MRI. We quantified proptosis through imaging. Results:\\n      Forty patients composed this series, 87.5% were female. Proptosis was the most\\n      common presentation (90%), followed by decreased visual acuity (65%), motility\\n      deficit (20%), and headache (20%). Gross total resection was achieved in 65% of\\n      the procedures. In late outcomes, 78% of the patients maintained or improved\\n      visual acuity and 85% maintained or improved headache. Proptosis significantly\\n      improved after surgery and along with the follow-up (P < 0.001). Ten patients\\n      were submitted to adjuvant RT, six of them after a subtotal resection. All\\n      patients of this subgroup had proptosis. It was observed a higher frequency of\\n      worse in visual acuity in patients submitted to RT (71% vs. 28%, P = 0.038).\\n      Conclusion: Resection of SOM was sufficient to stop the evolution of visual\\n      deficit and allowed the improvement of proptosis. Orbital reconstruction does not\\n      seem to be an essential step in reducing enophthalmos.\\nCI  - Copyright: (c) 2022 Surgical Neurology International.\\nFAU - Dos Santos, Alexandra Gomes\\nAU  - Dos Santos AG\\nAD  - Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Neurology, University of Sao Paulo\\n      Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Paiva, Wellingson Silva\\nAU  - Paiva WS\\nAD  - Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Neurology, University of Sao Paulo\\n      Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - da Roz, Leila Maria\\nAU  - da Roz LM\\nAD  - Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Neurology, University of Sao Paulo\\n      Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Santo, Marcelo Prudente do Espirito\\nAU  - Santo MPDE\\nAD  - Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Neurology, University of Sao Paulo\\n      Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Teixeira, Manoel Jacobsen\\nAU  - Teixeira MJ\\nAD  - Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Neurology, University of Sao Paulo\\n      Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Figueiredo, Eberval G\\nAU  - Figueiredo EG\\nAD  - Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Neurology, University of Sao Paulo\\n      Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - da Silva, Vinicius Trindade Gomes\\nAU  - da Silva VTG\\nAD  - Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Neurology, University of Sao Paulo\\n      Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220722\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Surg Neurol Int\\nJT  - Surgical neurology international\\nJID - 101535836\\nPMC - PMC9345102\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Central nervous system tumor\\nOT  - Exophthalmos\\nOT  - Gross total resection\\nOT  - Meningioma\\nOT  - Orbit reconstruction\\nOT  - Spheno-orbital meningiomas\\nCOIS- There are no conflicts of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:09\\nPHST- 2022/02/11 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/07/05 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:09 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.25259/SNI_165_2022 [doi]\\nAID - 10.25259/SNI_165_2022 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Surg Neurol Int. 2022 Jul 22;13:318. doi: 10.25259/SNI_165_2022. eCollection\\n      2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928309\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2229-5097 (Print)\\nIS  - 2152-7806 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Cost analysis comparison between anterior and posterior cervical spine\\n      approaches.\\nPG  - 300\\nLID - 10.25259/SNI_497_2022 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: The costs of cervical spine surgery have steadily increased.

Methods: We\\n      performed propensity score matching on financial data from 276 patients\\n      undergoing 1-3 level anterior versus posterior cervical fusions for degenerative \\n      disease (2015-2019).

This meta-analysis aimed to\\n      investigate the effect of beta-carotene on the total and cause-specific mortality\\n      as reported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We searched Medline,\\n      Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL Cochrane from inception to September 2021.\\n      Studies were eligible if enrolled adults with any health condition, compared\\n      beta-carotene supplements at any dose with placebo or no intervention, provided\\n      information on deaths from any cause, and were RCTs, in English. The risk of bias\\n      was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE. Risk ratios and\\n      their 95% confidence intervals were used and a P-value less than 0.05 was\\n      considered statistically significant. Results: Among 3,942 articles searched, 44 \\n      articles on 31 RCTs, which included 216,734 total subjects, 108,622 in\\n      beta-carotene supplement groups, and 108,112 in the placebo or no-intervention\\n      groups, were involved in the final analyses. In a random-effects meta-analysis of\\n      all 31 trials, beta-carotene supplements were found to have no preventive effect \\n      on mortality (risk ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.05, I (2) = 42%).\\n      Further, the analysis showed no preventive effect on cancer, cardiovascular,\\n      cerebrovascular, and other mortality causes. Instead, beta-carotene\\n      supplementation significantly increased the risk of lung cancer mortality (RR\\n      1.14, 95% CI 1.02, 1.27, I (2) = 3%) but decreased the risk of human\\n      immunodeficiency virus-related mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33, 0.92, I (2) = 0).\\n      Conclusion: More studies should be performed to better define the role of\\n      beta-carotene on survival, to confirm or deny our results. Therefore, the\\n      possible beneficial or harmful effects of the beta-carotene supplementation on\\n      mortality must not be overstated.

We investigated risk factors associated\\n      with Relative Systemic Hypertension (RSH) or systemic hypertension in SCD\\n      patients in Cameroon. Using R, Multivariate multinomial logistic regression\\n      modeling was used to examine the effects of the demographic, anthropometric,\\n      clinical, and laboratory factors to determine risk factors. A total of 815\\n      individuals with SCD, including 380 (46.6%) males were analyzed. At baseline, the\\n      median age [interquartile range] was 18.0 [12.0-25.0] years, ranging from 3 to 66\\n      years. Approximately three-quarters of the patients (n = 645; 79.1%) had normal\\n      BP, 151 (18.5%) had RSH and 19 (2.3%) had hypertension. Age (P < 0.001) and\\n      gender (P = 0.022) were significantly different across the BP categories.

Infection with P. falciparum has been shown to induce\\n      different B cell maturation responses dependent upon the age of the patient,\\n      number of previous exposures, and severity of the disease. Described here are\\n      dynamics of Ig responses to a panel of 32 P. falciparum antigens by patients\\n      followed for 42 days and classified individuals as showing characteristics of an \\n      apparent first P. falciparum infection (naive) or a repeat exposure (non-naive). \\n      Six parameters were modeled to characterize the dynamics of IgM, IgG1, IgG3, and \\n      IgA for these two exposure groups with differences assessed among Ig\\n      isotypes/subclasses and unique antigens. Naive patients had significantly longer \\n      periods of time to reach peak Ig titer (range 4-7 days longer) and lower maximum \\n      Ig titers when compared with non-naive patients. Modeled time to seronegativity\\n      was significantly higher in non-naive patients for IgM and IgA, but not for the\\n      two IgG subclasses.

Testosterone bind to the androgen receptor and\\n      polymorphisms of the receptor gene such as CAG repeat length may affect\\n      transcriptional activity, possibly mitigating testosterone effects. The aims were\\n      to study the CAG repeat length and testosterone levels at four time points\\n      following a myocardial infarction (MI) and to analyse possible relationships\\n      between CAG repeat length and cardiovascular prognosis. Methods and results: Male\\n      patients admitted for acute MI (n = 122) from the Glucose in Acute Myocardial\\n      Infarction study were included. Blood samples were drawn at four time points (day\\n      after admission, at discharge, and at 3 and 12 months post-infarction) for\\n      assessment of testosterone levels. Patients were followed for a median of 11.6\\n      years. Cox regression analyses were performed for CAG repeat length by one unit\\n      increment and by > vs. </=median for cardiovascular events and all-cause\\n      mortality. Median CAG repeat length was 20. There was no difference in\\n      testosterone levels at each time point when dividing the cohort into </= vs. >CAG\\n      repeat median (=20). There was no association between CAG repeat length either as\\n      a continuous or categorical variable in unadjusted and age-adjusted Cox analyses \\n      for cardiovascular events. While CAG >20 was associated with all-cause mortality \\n      in unadjusted analyses (hazard ratio 2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.13-4.22; P =\\n      0.02), it did not remain significant following adjustment for age. Conclusion:\\n      CAG repeat length was not associated with testosterone levels or prognosis in men\\n      with acute MI.\\nCI  - Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

This study\\'s objective was to\\n      test whether an electronic patient-reported outcome quality of life tool (PROQOL)\\n      in which patients identify their primary concern during clinic visits improves\\n      cancer patient quality of life (QOL). Patients and methods: This single center\\n      non-blinded prospective clinical trial randomized patients (2:1) to PROQOL versus\\n      usual care (UC). Two patient cohorts were enrolled: those with hematologic\\n      malignancies (multiple myeloma [MM] or light chain amyloidosis [AL]) and solid\\n      tumors (head and neck [H/N] or gynecologic [GYN] malignancies). Primary endpoint \\n      was patient-reported QOL at 12 months measured by a single-item Linear Analog\\n      Self-Assessment. Value to patients and impact on clinician workflow was measured \\n      using a \"was it worth it\" survey. The study was powered to detect a 0.5 standard \\n      deviation difference between groups. Results: Overall 383 patients were enrolled,\\n      171 with MM, 62 AL, 113 GYN, and 37 H/N between July 2016 and April 2018, with\\n      12-month follow-up. There were 171 (44.6%) male patients and median age was 62\\n      years (range 31-87). The most often selected concern was physical health (30.9%),\\n      and second was cancer diagnosis and treatment (29.1%). Mean QOL was 7.12 for\\n      PROQOL and 6.98 for UC (0-10 scale) at 12 months, with no between-group\\n      difference overall (p = 0.56) or within hematologic or solid tumor cohorts,\\n      respectively. Among patients, 74% thought the PROQOL tool was worthwhile, 86%\\n      would choose PROQOL again, and 81% would recommend it to others. Among\\n      clinicians, 95% responded that PROQOL was worthwhile and did not think that\\n      PROQOL negatively impacted their workflow. Conclusions: Although we did not\\n      demonstrate a QOL difference between PROQOL and UC groups; the PROQOL tool held\\n      considerable value in identifying patients\\' main concerns over time and was\\n      worthwhile for patients and clinicians.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 The Authors.\\nFAU - Warsame, Rahma\\nAU  - Warsame R\\nAD  - Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nAD  - Patricia and Robert Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery, Mayo\\n      Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Cook, Joselle\\nAU  - Cook J\\nAD  - Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nAD  - Department of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Fruth, Briant\\nAU  - Fruth B\\nAD  - Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Hubbard, Joleen\\nAU  - Hubbard J\\nAD  - Department of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Croghan, Katrina\\nAU  - Croghan K\\nAD  - Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Price, Katharine A R\\nAU  - Price KAR\\nAD  - Department of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Jatoi, Aminah\\nAU  - Jatoi A\\nAD  - Department of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Kumar, Shaji\\nAU  - Kumar S\\nAD  - Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Thompson, Carrie\\nAU  - Thompson C\\nAD  - Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Buckner, Jan\\nAU  - Buckner J\\nAD  - Department of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Dispenzieri, Angela\\nAU  - Dispenzieri A\\nAD  - Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Sloan, Jeff\\nAU  - Sloan J\\nAD  - Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.\\nFAU - Dueck, Amylou C\\nAU  - Dueck AC\\nAD  - Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220713\\nPL  - Netherlands\\nTA  - Contemp Clin Trials Commun\\nJT  - Contemporary clinical trials communications\\nJID - 101671157\\nPMC - PMC9344350\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - AL, Light chain amyloidosis\\nOT  - GYN, Gynecologic malignancies\\nOT  - H/N, Head and Neck malignancy\\nOT  - Health care delivery\\nOT  - MM, Multiple myeloma\\nOT  - Patient-reported outcomes\\nOT  - Quality of life\\nCOIS- The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or\\n      personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in\\n      this paper.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:09\\nPHST- 2021/08/18 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/30 00:00 [revised]\\nPHST- 2022/07/08 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:09 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.1016/j.conctc.2022.100964 [doi]\\nAID - S2451-8654(22)00081-3 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Contemp Clin Trials Commun. 2022 Jul 13;29:100964. doi:\\n      10.1016/j.conctc.2022.100964. eCollection 2022 Oct.\\n\\nPMID- 35928284\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1663-9812 (Print)\\nIS  - 1663-9812 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Xiongshao Zhitong Recipe Attenuates Nitroglycerin-Induced Migraine-Like Behaviors\\n      via the Inhibition of Inflammation Mediated by Nitric Oxide Synthase.\\nPG  - 920201\\nLID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.920201 [doi]\\nAB  - Migraine is a major cause of disability worldwide, particularly in young adults\\n      and middle-aged women. Xiongshao Zhitong Recipe (XZR) is a traditional Chinese\\n      medicine prescription used for treating migraine, but its bioactive components\\n      and therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to confirm the therapeutic\\n      effect of XZR on migraine and to determine the possible mechanism and bioactive\\n      components of XZR. Here, a sensitive UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS assay was carried out \\n      to analyze the ingredients of XZR, and a total of 62 components were identified, \\n      including coumarins, phenolic acids, phthalides, flavonoids, and terpenoids;\\n      among them, 15 components were identified in the serum samples after XZR\\n      treatment. We established a rat model of migraine via nitroglycerin (NTG)\\n      injection. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that XZR attenuated allodynia and\\n      photophobia in rats with NTG-induced migraine, and XZR also demonstrated\\n      analgesic effects. XZR reversed the abnormal levels of nitric oxide,\\n      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance\\n      P (SP) to normal levels. XZR also downregulated inflammatory reactions, including\\n      mast cell degranulation and serum IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels. In terms \\n      of mechanism, we revealed that XZR treated NTG-induced migraine through the\\n      inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible nitric oxide\\n      synthase (iNOS) expression in both the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and\\n      periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), as well as the total NOS enzyme activity, which\\n      regulated the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Additionally, imperatorin and\\n      xanthotoxin, two major ingredients of XZR, showed a high binding affinity to nNOS\\n      (Gly468-Leu616). In vitro, XZR, imperatorin, and xanthotoxin inhibited the nNOS\\n      expression and the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in lipopolysaccharide\\n      (LPS)-stimulated PC12 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated the therapeutic\\n      effects of XZR and provided evidence that XZR played a critical anti-inflammatory\\n      role by suppressing NOS and NF-kappaB signaling pathway activation. Imperatorin\\n      and xanthotoxin were potential bioactive components of XZR. The findings from\\n      this study supported that XZR was a candidate herbal drug for migraine therapy.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Yang, Chen, Liu, Kang, Ma, Li, Hu, Li, Gao, Wang and Wang.\\nFAU -

932646\\nLID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.932646 [doi]\\nAB  - Ginkgo Amillaria oral solution (GAO) is commonly used for the treatment of\\n      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in China.\\n      Piceatannol-3\\'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside for injection (PGI) is mainly used for\\n      the prevention and treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. With the\\n      spread of cerebrovascular disease, the possibility of combining the two drugs has\\n      increased; however, there is no research on the drug-drug interaction (DDI)\\n      between these two medicines. In this paper, an ultrahigh-performance liquid\\n      chromatography/quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap MS) method\\n      was established to characterize the chemical constituents of GAO first; 62\\n      compounds were identified or tentatively identified based on their retention time\\n      (RT), MS, and MS/MS data. Nine main compounds were determined by\\n      ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry\\n      (UPLC-QQQ-MS). Furthermore, incubation with liver microsomes in vitro was\\n      fulfilled; the results showed that GAO had a significant inhibitory effect on\\n      UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 (p < 0.05), and PGI was mainly metabolized by UGT1A9. The\\n      identification results of in vivo metabolites of PGI showed that PGI mainly\\n      undergoes a phase II binding reaction mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase\\n      (UGT) and sulfotransferase (SULT) in vivo. Therefore, pharmacokinetic studies\\n      were performed to investigate the DDI between GAO and PGI. The results showed\\n      that the AUC (p < 0.05) and T1/2 (p < 0.05) of PGI in vivo were significantly\\n      increased when administered together with GAO, whereas the CL was significantly\\n      decreased (p < 0.05). The exploration of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed \\n      that there was a DDI between GAO and PGI.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Yu, Hu, Zhou, Chen, Xing, Han, Ding, Han, Pan and Fu.\\nFAU - Yu, Zhenyan\\nAU  - Yu Z\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of\\n      Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Hu, Xiaohan\\nAU  - Hu X\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of\\n      Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Zhou, Lin\\nAU  - Zhou L\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of\\n      Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Chen, Huliang\\nAU  - Chen H\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of\\n      Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Xing, Yanchao\\nAU  - Xing Y\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of\\n      Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Han, Chunyue\\nAU  - Han C\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of\\n      Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Ding, Hui\\nAU  - Ding H\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of\\n      Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Han, Lifeng\\nAU  - Han L\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of\\n      Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Pan, Guixiang\\nAU  - Pan G\\nAD  - Second Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,\\n      Tianjin, China.\\nFAU - Fu, Zhifei\\nAU  - Fu Z\\nAD  - State Key Laboratory of Component-Based Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of\\n      Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Pharmacol\\nJT  - Frontiers in pharmacology\\nJID - 101548923\\nPMC - PMC9344054\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Ginkgo Amillaria oral solution\\nOT  - LC-MS/MS\\nOT  - drug-drug interactions\\nOT  - pharmacokinetics\\nOT  - piceatannol-3\\'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside for injection\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:09\\nPHST- 2022/05/04 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/14 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:09 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.932646 [doi]\\nAID - 932646 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Pharmacol. 2022 Jul 19;13:932646. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2022.932646.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928277\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1663-9812 (Print)\\nIS  - 1663-9812 (Linking)\\nVI  - 13\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Irrational Use of Selected Herbal Medicines During Pregnancy: A\\n      Pharmacoepidemiological Evidence From Yemen.\\nPG  - 926449\\nLID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.926449 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Recent research indicates irrational use of herbal medicine (HM)\\n      during pregnancy that can be harmful to the mother and development of baby.\\n      However, no study has been conducted to explore the use of HM among pregnant\\n      women in a conflict region. Methods: This was a cross-sectional research\\n      conducted in July and August in the year 2017, at three hospitals in Sana\\'a,\\n      Yemen. Postpartum women were interviewed via the structured instrument to collect\\n      data on patterns of HM used during pregnancy. Results: A total of three hundred\\n      postpartum women participated in the study, with 59.3% (178) of them using at\\n      least one modality of HM in the previous pregnancy. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum\\n      L), ginger (Zingiber officinale Z), barley (Hordeum vulgare P), and garlic\\n      (Allium sativum A) were the most commonly used HM. Statistical analysis showed\\n      that consumers of HM had a higher rate of caesarian section and complications\\n      during and after the delivery. Conclusion: Consumption of HM during pregnancy was\\n      high including contraindicated modalities such as cinnamon (C. verum L) and\\n      barley (H. vulgare P).

Diyushengbai tablet (DYT) is used to prevent and treat leukopenia\\n      caused by various reasons. A meta-analysis was performed to systematically\\n      analyze the therapeutic effects of DYT on preventing and treating leukopenia\\n      caused by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Objectives: This study aimed to\\n      systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of DYT in preventing and treating\\n      leukopenia caused by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Methods: We performed a\\n      comprehensive literature search of electronic databases such as PubMed, The\\n      Cochrane Library, China Knowledge Network (CNKI), China Biomedical Literature\\n      Database (CBM), Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and VIP, through\\n      November of 2021. The scanning reports deadline is until November 2021. The bias \\n      risk evaluation criteria developed by the Cochrane collaborative organization\\n      were used to evaluate the literature quality of the included studies. The\\n      RevMan5.4 software was used to analyze the data, and the Stata16.0 was used to\\n      perform the Egger test. Results: After selecting all the databases, a total of 41\\n      reports which involved 3,793 cases were analyzed. Meta-analysis showed that DYT\\n      could significantly reduce the white blood cell (WBC) suppression caused by\\n      radiotherapy and chemotherapy and improve the patients\\' WBC counts and\\n      neutrophils, compared with the efficacy of other oral WBC-elevating drugs such as\\n      Leucogen tablets and Batilol tablets and additional utilization of granulocyte\\n      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The results of meta-analysis showed that for\\n      preventive medication purpose, the overall incidence of leukocyte suppression was\\n      [RR = 0.74, 95%CI (0.59, 0.92), p = 0.006], and the white blood cell count was\\n      [MD = 1.12, 95%CI (0.95, 1.29), p < 0.00001]; while for therapeutic purpose, the \\n      incidence of overall leukocyte suppression was [RR = 0.61, 95%CI (0.38, 0.95), p \\n      = 0.03], and the white blood cell count was [MD = 1.20, 95%CI (0.77, 1.62), p <\\n      0.00001]. More importantly, the additional use of DYT can reduce the application \\n      amount of G-CSF. The results showed that the application of G-CSF can be reduced \\n      by an average of 1.57 from the beginning of treatment to return normal white\\n      blood cells around 2.23 in two cycles of chemotherapy. Conclusion: DYT is more\\n      effective in preventing and treating leukopenia caused by radiotherapy and\\n      chemotherapy than other oral WBC-elevating drugs, which have a high clinical\\n      value.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Xu, Li, Hu, Liu, Zhao, Xie and Wang.\\nFAU - Xu, Xiaoqing\\nAU  - Xu X\\nAD  - Department of Oncology, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional\\n      Chinese Medicine (Shandong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine), \\n      Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Li, Hongmin\\nAU  - Li H\\nAD  - Oncology Center, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial\\n      People\\'s Hospital, Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Hu, Xiwen\\nAU  - Hu X\\nAD  - Department of Oncology, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional\\n      Chinese Medicine (Shandong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine), \\n      Jinan, China.\\nFAU - Liu, Juan\\nAU  - Liu J\\nAD  - Chengdu Di\\'ao Group Tianfu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Zhao, Fang\\nAU  - Zhao F\\nAD  - Chengdu Di\\'ao Group Tianfu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Xie, Kaiyong\\nAU  - Xie K\\nAD  - Chengdu Di\\'ao Group Tianfu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China.\\nFAU - Wang, Jun\\nAU  - Wang J\\nAD  - Department of TCM Pharmacy, Chengdu Integrated TCM and Western Medicine Hospital,\\n      Chengdu, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Systematic Review\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Pharmacol\\nJT  - Frontiers in pharmacology\\nJID - 101548923\\nPMC - PMC9343950\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Diyushengbai tablet\\nOT  - meta-analysis\\nOT  - radiotherapy and chemotherapy\\nOT  - systematic review\\nOT  - tumor\\nCOIS- Author JL, FZ, and KX were employed by Chengdu Di\\'ao Group Tianfu Pharmaceutical \\n      Co., Ltd.

Nurses are actively involved in and\\n      responsible for patient care, especially in medication administration. This study\\n      aimed to estimate the knowledge, decision-making basis and confidence and\\n      decision support needs related to HAMs among pediatric nurses in China. Methods: \\n      A web-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted among pediatric nurses who were\\n      recruited from 14 member hospitals of the Pediatric Nursing Alliance of National \\n      Children\\'s Medical Center in China using a convenient sampling technique. Data\\n      were collected using a self-administered instrument composed of four parts: the\\n      demographic characteristics of participants, participants\\' knowledge about HAMs, \\n      participants\\' self-evaluation of the basis of and confidence in decision-making, \\n      and decision support needs regarding HAMs. Among the participants, the maximum\\n      score for HAM knowledge was 100. All data were entered and analyzed using SPSS\\n      20.0. Results: A total of 966 nurses participated in this study. Nurses were\\n      found to have insufficient knowledge about HAMs, with a median (IQR) of 75.0\\n      (70.0, 80.0), out of a maximum score of 100. Knowledge about HAM administration\\n      was significantly higher than that about HAM regulation, with a p value < 0.001. \\n      The three lowest-scoring items concerned HAM regulation, and the \"Treat fentanyl \\n      skin patches as a regulated narcotic\" item obtained the lowest score, with only\\n      1/5 of respondents answering it correctly. Most participants reported that their \\n      basis for decision-making about HAMs was drug instructions (90.0%) or drug\\n      handbooks (81.9%) and evaluated their confidence in decision-making about HAMs as\\n      high or relatively high (84.6%). The decision-making difficulties when\\n      encountering HAMs focused on most stages of HAM administration, especially the\\n      appropriateness of prescriptions, checks, preparation and administration. The\\n      vast majority of participants assessed decision support as necessary or very\\n      necessary (92.0%), and the most popular options for decision support were\\n      computerized clinical decision support systems (46.4%) and real-time online\\n      communication with pharmacists (23.9%). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the\\n      inadequacies in HAM knowledge, the basis and difficulty of decision-making, and\\n      decision support needs regarding HAMs in Chinese pediatric nurses. Nurses need\\n      greater support in HAM administration, including not only training but also\\n      adequate technology, mutually beneficial interprofessional collaboration, and a\\n      positive institutional culture.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 He, Huang, Lu, Gu, Hu and Zhang.\\nFAU - He, Mengxue\\nAU  - He M\\nAD  - School of Nursing, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.\\nAD  - Fudan University Centre for Evidence-based Nursing: A Joanna Briggs Institute\\n      Centre of Excellence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.\\nAD  - Shanghai Children\\'s Medical Center, Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University,\\n      School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Huang, Qin\\nAU  - Huang Q\\nAD  - Children\\'s Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Lu, Hong\\nAU  - Lu H\\nAD  - Shanghai Children\\'s Medical Center, Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University,\\n      School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Gu, Ying\\nAU  - Gu Y\\nAD  - Children\\'s Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Hu, Yan\\nAU  - Hu Y\\nAD  - School of Nursing, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.\\nAD  - Fudan University Centre for Evidence-based Nursing: A Joanna Briggs Institute\\n      Centre of Excellence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.\\nFAU - Zhang, Xiaobo\\nAU  - Zhang X\\nAD  - Children\\'s Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Pharmacol\\nJT  - Frontiers in pharmacology\\nJID - 101548923\\nPMC - PMC9343802\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - decision support\\nOT  - high-alert medications\\nOT  - knowledge\\nOT  - medication errors\\nOT  - nurses\\nOT  - pediatrics\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:09\\nPHST- 2022/01/22 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/21 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:09 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.860438 [doi]\\nAID - 860438 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Pharmacol. 2022 Jul 19;13:860438. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2022.860438.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928235\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 1205-9838 (Print)\\nIS  - 1205-9838 (Linking)\\nVI  - 58\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Emotional impact of compassionate extubation on respiratory therapists and\\n      nurses: A pilot study.\\nPG  - 115-120\\nLID - 10.29390/cjrt-2022-022 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Compassionate extubation (CE) refers to withdrawing mechanical\\n      ventilation and allowing a patient to die peacefully at the end of life. The\\n      primary objective of this pilot study was to quantify the emotional impact of CE \\n      on Respiratory Therapists (RT) and Registered Nurses (RNs). Methods: This pilot\\n      survey was conducted between March and April 2021 at an academic medical center\\n      among RTs and RNs. It included questions on participants\\' demographics, work\\n      characteristics, and Impact of Events (IES) scale to assess the subjective stress\\n      caused by CE. Data were analyzed using descriptive and chi(2) statistics.\\n      Results: Among 20 participants, 18 (90%) were females, 12 (60%) were in the\\n      20-40-year age group, 12 (60%) were RTs, and 8 (40%) RNs. Around 15 (75%)\\n      participants worked day shifts with a weekly average of 3-4 shifts, and 14 (70%) \\n      performed/observed CE within 1 month before taking this survey. CE\\n      performed/observed in a month was </=2 among 15 (75%) and 3-5 among 4 (20%)\\n      participants. Mean total IES score was 16.7 (12.3) among all participants\\n      representing 7 (35%) having low, 6 (30%) moderate, and 7 (35%) high emotional\\n      impact when performing CE. Risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder\\n      (PTSD) was present in 6 (30%) participants. A significantly higher number of\\n      participants in the low impact group were satisfied with the institutional CE\\n      process (p = 0.043) than those in the medium/high impact group. Conclusion: This \\n      pilot study findings reveal that RTs and RNs experience moderate to high levels\\n      of subjective stress when performing CE.

Data\\n      from India are very scarce about predictors of mortality among COVID-19 patients.\\n      Methodology: In the present retrospective study of 65 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19\\n      patients, we retrieved data regarding clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters,\\n      and radiological grading of severity. Further, we also collected data about their\\n      hospital course, duration of stay, treatment, and outcome.

Macrophage\\n      cholesterol homeostasis depends on serum lipoprotein functions, including the HDL\\n      capacity to promote cell cholesterol efflux (CEC) and the serum capacity to\\n      promote cell cholesterol loading (CLC). The aim of this observational study was\\n      to investigate the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9-i) treatment on HDL-CEC and \\n      serum CLC in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). 31 genetically\\n      confirmed FH patients were recruited. Blood was collected and serum isolated at\\n      baseline and after 6 months of PCSK9-i treatment. HDL-CEC was evaluated through\\n      the main pathways with a radioisotopic cell-based assay. Serum CLC was assessed\\n      fluorimetrically in human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages. After treatment\\n      with PCSK9-i, total cholesterol and LDL-c significantly decreased (-41.6%, p <\\n      0.0001 and -56.7%, p < 0.0001, respectively). Total HDL-CEC was not different\\n      between patients before and after treatment. Conversely, despite no changes in\\n      HDL-c levels between the groups, ABCG1 HDL-CEC significantly increased after\\n      treatment (+22.2%, p < 0.0001) as well as HDL-CEC by aqueous diffusion (+7.8%, p \\n      = 0.0008). Only a trend towards reduction of ABCA1 HDL-CEC was observed after\\n      treatment. PCSK9-i significantly decreased serum CLC (-6.6%, p = 0.0272). This\\n      effect was only partly related to the reduction of LDL-c levels. In conclusion,\\n      PCSK9-i treatment significantly increased HDL-CEC through ABCG1 and aqueous\\n      diffusion pathways and reduced the serum CLC in FH patients. The favorable effect\\n      of PCSK9-i on functional lipid profile could contribute to the cardiovascular\\n      benefit of these drugs in FH patients.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Palumbo, Giammanco, Purrello, Pavanello, Mombelli, Di Pino,\\n      Piro, Cefalu, Calabresi, Averna, Bernini, Zimetti, Adorni and Scicali.\\nFAU - Palumbo, Marcella\\nAU  - Palumbo M\\nAD  - Department of Food and Drug, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.\\nFAU - Giammanco, Antonina\\nAU  - Giammanco A\\nAD  - Department of Health Promotion, Mother and Child Care, Internal Medicine and\\n      Medical Specialties (ProMISE)-University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.\\nFAU - Purrello, Francesco\\nAU  - Purrello F\\nAD  - Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania,\\n      Italy.\\nFAU - Pavanello, Chiara\\nAU  - Pavanello C\\nAD  - Centro E.

However, their\\n      generic designs do not accommodate the variability in face shape across genders\\n      and ethnicities. Accordingly, they are regularly overtightened to compensate for \\n      a poor fit. The present study aims at investigating the biomechanical and thermal\\n      loads during respirator application and the associated changes in local skin\\n      physiology at the skin-device interface. Materials and Methods: Sixteen healthy\\n      volunteers were recruited and reflected a range of gender, ethnicities and facial\\n      anthropometrics. Four single-use respirators were evaluated representing\\n      different geometries, size and material interfaces. Participants were asked to\\n      wear each respirator in a random order while a series of measurements were\\n      recorded, including interface pressure, temperature and relative humidity.\\n      Measures of transepidermal water loss and skin hydration were assessed pre- and\\n      post-respirator application, and after 20 minutes of recovery. Statistical\\n      analysis assessed differences between respirator designs and associations between\\n      demographics, interface conditions and parameters of skin health. Results:\\n      Results showed a statistically significant negative correlation (p < 0.05)\\n      between the alar width and interface pressures at the nasal bridge, for three of \\n      the respirator designs. The nasal bridge site also corresponded to the highest\\n      pressures for all respirator designs. Temperature and humidity significantly\\n      increased (p < 0.05) during each respirator application. Significant increases in\\n      transepidermal water loss values (p < 0.05) were observed after the application\\n      of the respirators in females, which were most apparent at the nasal bridge.\\n      Conclusion: The results revealed that specific facial features affected the\\n      distribution of interface pressures and depending on the respirator design and\\n      material, changes in skin barrier function were evident. The development of\\n      respirator designs that accommodate a diverse range of face shapes and protect\\n      the end users from skin damage are required to support the long-term use of these\\n      devices.\\nCI  - (c) 2022 Caggiari et al.\\nFAU - Caggiari, Silvia\\nAU  - Caggiari S\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-8928-2141\\nAD  - Clinical Academic Facility, School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton,\\n      Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.\\nFAU - Bader, Dan L\\nAU  - Bader DL\\nAD  - Clinical Academic Facility, School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton,\\n      Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.\\nFAU - Foxell, Finn\\nAU  - Foxell F\\nAD  - Clinical Academic Facility, School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton,\\n      Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.\\nFAU - Pipe, Nicholas\\nAU  - Pipe N\\nAD  - Clinical Academic Facility, School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton,\\n      Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.\\nFAU - Couch, Seana\\nAU  - Couch S\\nAD  - Clinical Academic Facility, School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton,\\n      Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.\\nFAU - Turner, Abbie\\nAU  - Turner A\\nAD  - Clinical Academic Facility, School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton,\\n      Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.\\nFAU - Worsley, Peter R\\nAU  - Worsley PR\\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-0145-5042\\nAD  - Clinical Academic Facility, School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton,\\n      Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220726\\nPL  - New Zealand\\nTA  - Med Devices (Auckl)\\nJT  - Medical devices (Auckland, N.Z.)\\nJID - 101566041\\nPMC - PMC9343257\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - goodness of fit\\nOT  - interface pressure\\nOT  - physiological response\\nOT  - respiratory protective equipment\\nOT  - skin health\\nCOIS- The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:01\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:07\\nPHST- 2022/04/10 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/15 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:07 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:01 [medline]\\nAID - 10.2147/MDER.S370142 [doi]\\nAID - 370142 [pii]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Med Devices (Auckl). 2022 Jul 26;15:241-252. doi: 10.2147/MDER.S370142.\\n      eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928208\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- In-Process\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2235-2988 (Electronic)\\nIS  - 2235-2988 (Linking)\\nVI  - 12\\nDP  - 2022\\nTI  - Air Pollution\\'s Impact on Cardiac Remodeling in an Experimental Model of Chagas\\n      Cardiomyopathy.\\nPG  - 830761\\nLID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.830761 [doi]\\nAB  - Background: Chagas disease is characterized by intense myocardial fibrosis\\n      stimulated by the exacerbated production of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative\\n      stress, and apoptosis. Air pollution is a serious public health problem and also \\n      follows this same path. Therefore, air pollution might amplify the inflammatory\\n      response of Chagas disease and increase myocardial fibrosis. Methods: We studied \\n      groups of Trypanosoma cruzi infected Sirius hamsters (Chagas=CH and Chagas\\n      exposed to pollution=CH+P) and 2 control groups (control healthy animals=CT and\\n      control exposed to pollution=CT+P). We evaluated acute phase (60 days post\\n      infection) and chronic phase (10 months). Echocardiograms were performed to\\n      assess left ventricular systolic and diastolic diameter, in addition to ejection \\n      fraction. Interstitial collagen was measured by morphometry in picrosirius red\\n      staining tissue. The evaluation of inflammation was performed by gene and protein\\n      expression of cytokines IL10, IFN-gamma, and TNF; oxidative stress was quantified\\n      by gene expression of NOX1, MnSOD, and iNOS and by analysis of reactive oxygen\\n      species; and apoptosis was performed by gene expression of BCL2 and Capsase3, in \\n      addition to TUNEL analysis. Results: Chagas groups had increased collagen\\n      deposition mainly in the acute phase, but air pollution did not increase this\\n      deposition. Also, Chagas groups had lower ejection fraction in the acute phase (p\\n      = 0.002) and again air pollution did not worsen ventricular function or dilation.\\n      The analysis of the inflammation and oxidative stress pathways were also not\\n      amplified by air pollution. Apoptosis analysis showed increased expression of\\n      BCL2 and Caspase3 genes in chagasic groups in the acute phase, with a marginal p \\n      of 0.054 in BCL2 expression among infected groups, and TUNEL technique showed\\n      amplified of apoptotic cells by pollution among infected groups. Conclusions: A\\n      possible modulation of the apoptotic pathway was observed, inferring interference\\n      from air pollution in this pathway. However, it was not enough to promote a\\n      greater collagen deposition, or worsening ventricular function or dilation caused\\n      by air pollution in this model of Chagas cardiomyopathy.\\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2022 Fonseca, Pessoa, Ribeiro, Hotta, Ianni, Fernandes, Ferreira\\n      Rivero, Saldiva, Mady and Ramires.\\nFAU - Fonseca, Keila Cardoso Barbosa\\nAU  - Fonseca KCB\\nAD  - Instituto do Coracao (InCor), Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da\\n      Universidade de Sao Paulo (HCFMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Pessoa, Fernanda Gallinaro\\nAU  - Pessoa FG\\nAD  - Instituto do Coracao (InCor), Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da\\n      Universidade de Sao Paulo (HCFMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Ribeiro, Orlando do Nascimento\\nAU  - Ribeiro ODN\\nAD  - Instituto do Coracao (InCor), Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da\\n      Universidade de Sao Paulo (HCFMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Hotta, Viviane Tiemi\\nAU  - Hotta VT\\nAD  - Instituto do Coracao (InCor), Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da\\n      Universidade de Sao Paulo (HCFMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Ianni, Barbara Maria\\nAU  - Ianni BM\\nAD  - Instituto do Coracao (InCor), Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da\\n      Universidade de Sao Paulo (HCFMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Fernandes, Fabio\\nAU  - Fernandes F\\nAD  - Instituto do Coracao (InCor), Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da\\n      Universidade de Sao Paulo (HCFMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Ferreira Rivero, Dolores Helena Rodriguez\\nAU  - Ferreira Rivero DHR\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Experimental Air Pollution Laboratory, Laboratorio de\\n      Investigacao Medica 05 (LIM 05) - School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo,\\n      Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Saldiva, Paulo Hilario Nascimento\\nAU  - Saldiva PHN\\nAD  - Department of Pathology, Experimental Air Pollution Laboratory, Laboratorio de\\n      Investigacao Medica 05 (LIM 05) - School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo,\\n      Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Mady, Charles\\nAU  - Mady C\\nAD  - Instituto do Coracao (InCor), Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da\\n      Universidade de Sao Paulo (HCFMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nFAU - Ramires, Felix Jose Alvarez\\nAU  - Ramires FJA\\nAD  - Instituto do Coracao (InCor), Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da\\n      Universidade de Sao Paulo (HCFMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220719\\nPL  - Switzerland\\nTA  - Front Cell Infect Microbiol\\nJT  - Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology\\nJID - 101585359\\nSB  - IM\\nPMC - PMC9343625\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - Chagas disease\\nOT  - air pollution\\nOT  - cardiomyopathy\\nOT  - myocardial fibrosis\\nOT  - remodeling\\nCOIS- The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\\n      commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\\n      conflict of interest.\\nEDAT- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nMHDA- 2022/08/06 06:00\\nCRDT- 2022/08/05 02:07\\nPHST- 2021/12/07 00:00 [received]\\nPHST- 2022/06/20 00:00 [accepted]\\nPHST- 2022/08/05 02:07 [entrez]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]\\nPHST- 2022/08/06 06:00 [medline]\\nAID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.830761 [doi]\\nPST - epublish\\nSO  - Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2022 Jul 19;12:830761. doi:\\n      10.3389/fcimb.2022.830761. eCollection 2022.\\n\\nPMID- 35928204\\nOWN - NLM\\nSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINE\\nLR  - 20220805\\nIS  - 2514-6645 (Print)\\nIS  - 2514-6645 (Linking)\\nVI  - 9\\nIP  - 2\\nDP  - 2022 Jul\\nTI  - A comparison of in-person versus telephone consultations for outpatient hospital \\n      care.\\nPG  - 154-160\\nLID - 10.7861/fhj.2022-0006 [doi]\\nAB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has triggered a transition towards telemedicine for\\n      delivering outpatient care.

Digital platforms for rostering doctors\\n      improves both the quality of hospital care and the wellbeing of doctors. We\\n      evaluated the usability and acceptability of the HealthRota((c)) e-rostering\\n      system. Methods: We circulated an electronic survey among doctors with\\n      current/previous experience of using HealthRota, and measured usability (with a\\n      system usability score (SUS)) and acceptability. We collected data on how doctors\\n      believed HealthRota affected wellbeing, patient safety and training. Results:\\n      There were 209 responses (67 non-training clinical fellows, 114 training doctors \\n      and 27 consultants) from an estimated 350 doctors who have used HealthRota.\\n      Overall, the median SUS score was 86/100 (interquartile range (IQR) 75-97), and\\n      there were no differences by role (p=0.118), age (p=0.632) or years of experience\\n      (p=0.963). The median Likert score for recommending HealthRota to a colleague was\\n      5/5 (IQR 4-5). There were no differences in role (p=0.477), age (p=0.904) or\\n      years of experience (p=0.930).

However, the\\n      relationship between PSI and osteoarthritis (OA) remains unclear. Purpose: To\\n      evaluate a population-based cohort to (1) determine the rate of symptomatic OA,\\n      (2) identify patient characteristic risk factors for OA, and (3) evaluate the\\n      effect of posterior capsulolabral repair on OA progression. Study Design:\\n      Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: After review of 324 patient\\n      records, we included 115 patients (14 female, 101 male) diagnosed with PSI\\n      between January 1994 and July 2012 with an average follow-up of 12.5 years\\n      (range, 5-23 years). Medical records were reviewed for patient characteristics,\\n      injury characteristics, surgical details (if any), and radiographic progression\\n      of OA. Kaplan-Meier survival was used to estimate survival free of OA;\\n      characteristics associated with OA progression were determined via univariate Cox\\n      regression models, and associated 95% CIs and hazard ratios (HRs) are presented. \\n      Results: Overall, 14% (16/115) of patients had radiographic progression of\\n      symptomatic glenohumeral arthritis, with 5-year survival of 88.3% (95% CI,\\n      79.7%-97.3%). Older age at the time of instability diagnosis was associated with \\n      arthritis progression (10-year unit HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.26-3.03). Patients who\\n      underwent surgery demonstrated increased radiographic progression of OA (HR,\\n      4.03; 95% CI, 1.23-13.23). There was a trend of increased OA in patients treated \\n      with labral debridement compared with repair despite lower baseline levels of OA;\\n      however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = .09). Conclusion:\\n      Symptomatic glenohumeral arthritis is not seen routinely in patients with PSI.\\n      Although uncommon, an age of at least 30 years at the time of diagnosis and\\n      surgical intervention were identified as risk factors for developing symptomatic \\n      arthritis at long-term follow-up.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.\\nFAU - Till, Sara E\\nAU  - Till SE\\nAD  - Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.\\nFAU - Reinholz, Anna K\\nAU  - Reinholz AK\\nAD  - Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.\\nFAU - Lee, Julia\\nAU  - Lee J\\nAD  - Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.\\nFAU - Woodmass, Jarret M\\nAU  - Woodmass JM\\nAD  - Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.\\nFAU - Wu, Isabella T\\nAU  - Wu IT\\nAD  - Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.\\nFAU - Keyt, Lucas K\\nAU  - Keyt LK\\nAD  - Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.\\nFAU - Krych, Aaron J\\nAU  - Krych AJ\\nAD  - Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.\\nFAU - Dahm, Diane L\\nAU  - Dahm DL\\nAD  - Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.\\nFAU - Camp, Christopher L\\nAU  - Camp CL\\nAD  - Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220729\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Orthop J Sports Med\\nJT  - Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine\\nJID - 101620522\\nPMC - PMC9344110\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - glenohumeral arthritis\\nOT  - posterior capsulolabral repair\\nOT  - posterior labral repair\\nOT  - posterior shoulder instability\\nOT  - shoulder instability\\nCOIS- One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of\\n      interest or source of funding: The authors acknowledge support from the\\n      Foderaro-Quattrone Musculoskeletal-Orthopaedic Surgery Research Innovation Fund. \\n      This study was partially funded by the National Institute of Arthritis and\\n      Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases for the Musculoskeletal Research Training\\n      Program (T32AR56950).

While the Internet is easily accessible and\\n      ubiquitous today, the ability of patients to read, understand, and act on these\\n      materials is unknown. Purpose: To evaluate online resources about anterior\\n      cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery utilizing measures of readability,\\n      understandability, and actionability. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level \\n      of evidence, 4. Methods: Using the term \"ACL surgery,\" 2 independent searches\\n      were performed utilizing a public search engine (Google.com). Patient education\\n      materials were identified from the top 50 results. Audiovisual materials, news\\n      articles, materials intended for advertising or medical professionals, and\\n      materials unrelated to ACL surgery were excluded. Readability was quantified\\n      using the Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Simple Measure of\\n      Gobbledygook, Coleman-Liau Index, Automated Readability Index, and Gunning Fog\\n      Index. The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Printable Materials\\n      (PEMAT-P) was utilized to assess the actionability and understandability of\\n      materials. For each online source, the relationship between its Google search\\n      rank (from first to last) and its readability, understandability, and\\n      actionability was calculated utilizing the Spearman rank correlation coefficient \\n      (rhoS). Results: Overall, we identified 68 unique websites, of which 39 met\\n      inclusion criteria. The mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level was 10.08 +/- 2.34, with \\n      no website scoring at or below the 6th-grade level. Mean understandability and\\n      actionability scores were 59.18 +/- 10.86 (range, 33.64-79.17) and 34.41 +/-\\n      22.31 (range, 0.00-81.67), respectively. Only 5 (12.82%) and 1 (2.56%) resource\\n      scored above the 70% adequate PEMAT-P threshold mark for understandability and\\n      actionability, respectively. Readability (lowest P value = .103),\\n      understandability (rhoS = -0.13; P = .441), and actionability (rhoS = 0.28; P =\\n      .096) scores were not associated with Google rank. Conclusion: Patient education \\n      materials on ACL surgery scored poorly with respect to readability,\\n      understandability, and actionability. No online resource scored at the\\n      recommended reading level of the American Medical Association or National\\n      Institutes of Health. Only 5 resources scored above the proven threshold for\\n      understandability, and only 1 resource scored above it for actionability.\\nCI  - (c) The Author(s) 2022.\\nFAU - Gao, Burke\\nAU  - Gao B\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa\\n      City, Iowa, USA.\\nFAU - Shamrock, Alan G\\nAU  - Shamrock AG\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa\\n      City, Iowa, USA.\\nFAU - Gulbrandsen, Trevor R\\nAU  - Gulbrandsen TR\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa\\n      City, Iowa, USA.\\nFAU - O\\'Reilly, Olivia C\\nAU  - O\\'Reilly OC\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa\\n      City, Iowa, USA.\\nFAU - Duchman, Kyle R\\nAU  - Duchman KR\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa\\n      City, Iowa, USA.\\nFAU - Westermann, Robert W\\nAU  - Westermann RW\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa\\n      City, Iowa, USA.\\nFAU - Wolf, Brian R\\nAU  - Wolf BR\\nAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa\\n      City, Iowa, USA.\\nLA  - eng\\nPT  - Journal Article\\nDEP - 20220728\\nPL  - United States\\nTA  - Orthop J Sports Med\\nJT  - Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine\\nJID - 101620522\\nPMC - PMC9344126\\nOTO - NOTNLM\\nOT  - ACL reconstruction\\nOT  - ACL surgery\\nOT  - PEMAT\\nOT  - online materials\\nCOIS- One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of\\n      interest or source of funding: A.G.S. has received education payments from\\n      Wardlow Enterprises.
