TI  - Estimating the impact of COVID-19 on changes in volume sales of cigars, smokeless
      tobacco products, pipe, and roll-your-own tobacco in the United States.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We examined the potential impact of COVID-19 on trends in volume
      sales of non-cigarette combustible and smokeless tobacco products in the U.S.
      METHODS: We analyzed monthly national sales for cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipe, 
      and roll-your-own tobacco during June 2019-June 2021. Data were from the U.S
      Department of the Treasury. Interrupted time series were used to measure
      associations of the COVID-19 "shock" (taken as June 2020 or 6 months after the
      first diagnosis of COVID-19 in the US) and volume sales. Negative binomial
      regression was used to evaluate associations between volume sales and changes in 
      community mobility. RESULTS: Within interrupted time series analysis, the shock
      of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an initial increase in the number of
      little cigars sold by 11.43 million sticks (p<0.01), with no significant
      sustained change in trend. The COVID-19 shock was also associated with an initial
      increase in large cigar volume sales by 59.02 million sticks, followed by a
      subsequent decrease by 32.57 million sticks per month (p=0.005). Every 10%
      reduction in mobility to retail stores was significantly associated with reduced 
      volume sales of little cigars (IRR = 0.84, 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.98) and large cigars
      (IRR = 0.92, 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96). Other findings were statistically
      non-significant. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was associated with increased volume sales 
      for cigars and there was a significant association between reduced mobility to
      points of sale and reduced cigar volume sales. Intensified efforts are needed to 
      prioritize evidence-based tobacco prevention and control efforts amidst the
      pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: At the six-month mark following the start of the COVID-19
      pandemic in the US, we found that the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic was
      associated with a statistically significant initial increase in the number of
      little and large cigars sold nationwide.These COVID-19 related trends may have
      momentarily reversed the long-term declines seen in cigar sales prior to the
      pandemic.Intensified implementation of evidence-based tobacco control and
      prevention measures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic may help reduce aggregate
      tobacco consumption.

TI  - Presleep Heart-Rate Variability Biofeedback Improves Mood and Sleep Quality in
      Chinese Winter Olympic Bobsleigh Athletes.
PG  - 1-11

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of heart-rate variability (HRV)
      biofeedback in improving autonomic function, mood, and sleep in elite bobsleigh
      athletes. METHODS: Eight Chinese Winter Olympic bobsleigh athletes (age: 24 [2]
      y, body mass: 89 [15] kg, and height: 184 [5] cm) completed a randomized
      crossover study with and without HRV biofeedback before a single night's sleep.
      HRV biofeedback was provided 35 minutes prior to bedtime in the experimental
      condition. The assessment of HRV took place 45 and 10 minutes before bedtime. The
      Profile of Mood States questionnaire was completed 50 and 15 minutes prior to
      bedtime. Sleep duration and quality were measured through an air-mattress
      sleep-monitoring system. RESULTS: Sleep efficiency (P = .020; F = 7.831; CI,
      0.008 to 0.072) and the percentage of deep sleep duration increased (P = .013; F 
      = 10.875; CI, 0.006 to 0.035), while the percentage of light sleep decreased (P =
      .034; F = 6.893; CI, -0.038 to -0.002). Presleep HRV biofeedback increased
      parasympathetic and decreased sympathetic activity. Mood states of anger (P =
      .006, F = 7.573), panic (P = .031, F = 4.288), tension (P = .011, F = 6.284),
      depression (P = .010, F = 6.016), fatigue (P = .000, F = 16.901), and total mood 
      disturbance (P = .001, F = 11.225) were reduced before sleep. CONCLUSION:
      Presleep HRV biofeedback improved some measures of autonomic function, mood, and 
      sleep quality in Chinese Olympic bobsleigh athletes. Presleep HRV biofeedback
      provides a practical strategy that may help reduce sleep disturbances during
      periods of training and competition.

TI  - Maternal inflammation induces spatial learning and memory impairment in the F1
      and F2 generations of mice via sex-specific epigenetic mechanisms.

LID - 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2022.08.001 [doi]
AB  - Mounting evidence indicates that histone modifications are involved in
      aging-associated cognitive decline (AACD) and can be transmitted to offspring
      over multiple generations under conditions of stress. Here, we investigated the
      effects of maternal sub-chronic inflammation caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
      on AACD and histone modifications in the F1 and F2 generations of experimental
      mice as well as the potential sex specificity of intergenerational effects. In
      brief, F0-generation CD-1 dams were exposed to LPS (50microg/kg) or saline (CON) 
      during late pregnancy. Subsequently, F1 males and females (at 2 months-of-age)
      from the LPS treatment group were mated with non-littermates from the LPS group
      or wild-type mice to produce F2 generations of parental- (F2-LPS2), paternal-
      (F2M-LPS1) and maternal-origin (F2F-LPS1) mice. Then, CON-F1 males and females
      were mated with wild-type mice to generate F2 generations of paternal- (F2M-CON1)
      and maternal-origin (F2F-CON1). Next, we evaluated the cognitive ability and
      levels of hippocampal H4K12ac and H3K9me3 in the F1 and F2 offspring at 3- and 13
      months-of-age. Overall, F1 male and female LPS groups presented with elevated
      corticosterone (P < 0.001, P = 0.036, P = 0.025, 0.012, respectively) and
      cytokine responses, poorer cognitive performance (all P < 0.05) and H3K9
      hypermethylation and H4K12 hypoacetylation in the dorsal hippocampus (all P <
      0.05); these issues were carried over to the F2 generation via the parents,
      predominantly in the paternal lineage. Moreover, the levels of H3K9me3 and
      H4K12ac were significant correlated with cognitive performance (all P < 0.05),
      regardless of whether inflammatory insults had been incurred directly or
      indirectly. These findings indicated that gestational inflammatory insults in the
      F0 generation accelerated AACD in the F2 generation, along with H3K9
      hypermethylation and H4K12 hypoacetylation in the hippocampus, and that these
      issues were derived from the F1 parents, especially from the F1 fathers.

LID - 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2022.07.014 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: End-of-Life (EOL) care consumes a substantial amount of healthcare
      resources, especially among older persons with cancer. Having Alzheimer's Disease
      and Related Dementias (ADRD) brings additional complexities to these patients'
      EOL care. OBJECTIVES: To examine the Medicare expenditures at the EOL (last
      twelve months of life) among beneficiaries having cancer and ADRD versus those
      without ADRD. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study used 2004-2016 Surveillance, 
      Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data. Patient populations were deceased
      Medicare beneficiaries with cancer (breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate) and
      continuously enrolled for 12 months before death. Beneficiaries with ADRD were
      propensity score matched with non-ADRD counterparts. Generalized Estimating
      Equation Model was deployed to estimate monthly Medicare expenditures.
      Generalized Linear Models were constructed to assess total EOL expenditures.
      RESULTS: 86,396 beneficiaries were included (43,198 beneficiaries with ADRD and
      43,198 beneficiaries without ADRD). Beneficiaries with ADRD utilized $64,901 at
      the EOL, which was roughly $407 more than those without ADRD ($64,901 vs.
      $64,494, p=0.31). Compared to beneficiaries without ADRD, those with ADRD had 11%
      higher monthly expenditure and 7% higher in total expenditures. Greater
      expenditure was incurred on inpatient (5%), skilled nursing facility (SNF)
      (119%), home health (42%), and hospice (44%) care. CONCLUSION: Medicare spending 
      at the EOL per beneficiary was not statistically different between cohorts.
      However, specific types of service (i.e., inpatient, SNF, home health, and
      hospice) were significantly higher in the ADRD group compared to their non-ADRD
      counterparts. This study underscored the potential financial burden and informed 
      Medicare about allocation of resources at the EOL.

TI  - Impact of residual stenosis on clinical outcomes when performing carotid artery
      stenting without postdilation.
LID - S0741-5214(22)01947-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2022.07.021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many centers consider postdilation if the final angiography after
      carotid artery stenting (CAS) shows residual stenosis greater than 30-40%.
      Postdilation has been demonstrated to potentially increase the risk of developing
      neurologic events. This study aimed to investigate the safety of CAS without
      postdilation regardless of the degree of residual stenosis. METHOD: We
      retrospectively investigated 191 patients who underwent transfemoral CAS without 
      postdilation intendedly. All cases underwent mild predilation and self-expanding 
      stent implantation. We divided the patients into a residual stenosis >/=40% group
      (n=69, 36.1%) and a residual stenosis <40% group (n=122, 63.9%) according to
      their final angiography. We compared the procedural (within 30 days after CAS)
      and non-procedural (afterward) adverse cardiovascular events and in-stent
      restenosis (ISR) between the two groups. We also investigated the incidence of
      perioperative hemodynamic depression (HD) between groups and the changes in
      residual stenosis over the follow-up time. RESULTS: Patients in the residual
      stenosis >/=40% group had a higher preoperative stenosis rate and a greater
      proportion of severely calcified lesions than those in the <40% group. There was 
      one procedural cardiac death (0.5%), five strokes (2.6%), and four myocardial
      infarctions (2.1%). A total of 2.9% had stroke or death procedurally in the
      residual stenosis >/=40% group and 3.2% in the residual stenosis <40% group
      (p=1.000). The median non-procedural follow-up time was 22 months, with a total
      of 6 deaths and 4 strokes. The cumulative 2-year death or stroke rate was 6.2%,
      with 5.9% in the residual stenosis >/=40% group versus 6.7% in the residual
      stenosis <40% group (p=0.507). There were 2 cases of ISR in the residual stenosis
      >/=40% group and 3 in the residual stenosis <40% group (p=0.927). The difference 
      in the peak systolic velocity of the target lesion between groups at 3 months
      after CAS was no longer present, and residual stenosis stabilized at 10-20% at 6 
      months in both groups. The patients showed an association between increasing HD
      incidence and residual stenosis in a significantly graded response (p=0.021).
      CONCLUSION: Residual stenosis after carotid stenting without postdilation is not 
      associated with the risk of postoperative adverse events. This study provides
      evidence for the feasibility of a no postdilation strategy for CAS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Online resources can be a valuable source of information for patients 
      and have been shown to result in more inquiry during medical office visits,
      following physician medical recommendation more closely, and making self-directed
      lifestyle changes. The accessibility to these resources is limited by the
      readability level of the article and the literacy level of the population.
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is estimated to affect between 8 and 12 million
      people in the United States with greater disease severity among under insured or 
      un-insured populations. As PAD continues to increase in prevalence, it is
      imperative that patients have access to comprehensible patient-centered health
      information. This study aims to evaluate the readability of online PAD patient
      education materials. METHODS: The search engine Google was utilized to collect
      the first 25 patient-accessible online articles pertaining to the search term
      "peripheral artery disease." Articles were then categorized by source type:
      hospital, professional society, or other. Readability was measured using the
      following tests: Automated Readability Index (ARI), Coleman-Liau Index, (CLI)
      Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Gunning Fog, Linsear Write Formula, and the
      SMOG Index. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis
      Software (SAS), with p-values <0.05 being statistically significant. RESULTS:
      Twenty-five articles were categorized by source and statistically analyzed. The
      average readability of PAD patient education materials was 10.8 and significantly
      above the AMA, NIH, and USDHHS recommended reading level of 6th grade.
      Readability scores among source categories were not significantly different.
      CONCLUSIONS: Commonly available online PAD resources are written at a grade level
      above that currently recommended by medical societies. Hospitals, professional
      societies, and other stakeholders in PAD patient education should take into
      consideration the readability of their materials to make medicine more
      accessible. Readable articles may combat historic, and structural racism often
      found in our health care system that marginalizes those with lower health
      literacy. It is imperative to develop patient education at an appropriate level
      to enrich patient autonomy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The relationship between intraluminal thrombus (ILT) and abdominal
      aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth and rupture risk remains ambiguous. Studies have
      shown a limited effect of antiplatelet therapy on ILT size, while the impact of
      anticoagulant therapy on ILT is unresolved. This study aims to evaluate an
      association between antithrombotic therapy and ILT size assessed with
      three-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasound (3D-CEUS) in a cohort of AAA
      patients. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 309 patients with small AAAs were 
      examined with 3D-CEUS. Patients were divided into three groups based on
      prescribed antithrombotic therapy: Anticoagulant (N=36), antiplatelet (N=222),
      and no antithrombotic therapy (N=51). Patients' ILT size was calculated in volume
      (ml) and thickness (mm) and compared between the three groups. RESULTS: Patients 
      on anticoagulants had a significantly lower estimated marginal mean ILT volume of
      16ml (SE: +/-3.2) compared with 28 ml (SE: +/-2.7) in the no antithrombotic group
      and 30ml (SE: +/-1.3) in the antiplatelet group when adjusting for AAA-volume
      (p<.001) and comorbidities (p<.001). In addition, patients on anticoagulant
      therapy had significantly lower estimated marginal mean ILT thickness of 10mm
      (SE: +/-1.1) compared with 13mm (SE: +/-0.9) in the no antithrombotic group of
      and 13mm (SE: +/-0.4) in the antiplatelet group when adjusting for AAA-diameter
      (p=.03) and comorbidities (p=.035). CONCLUSIONS: 3D-CEUS is applicable for ILT
      assessment and demonstrates that AAA patients on anticoagulant therapy have lower
      ILT thickness and volume than AAA patients on antiplatelet therapy and those
      without antithrombotic therapy. Causality between anticoagulants and ILT size,
      and extrapolation to AAA growth and rupture risk, is unknown and merits further
      investigations, to further nuance ultrasound-based AAA surveillance strategy.

TI  - Alkaline lignin does not immobilize cadmium in soils but decreases cadmium
      accumulation in the edible part of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.).

AB  - Heavy metal contamination and low use efficiency of phosphorus (P) fertilizers
      are worldwide issues. Alkaline lignin is expected to decrease the heavy metal
      risk and enhance the P availability in heavy-metal-contaminated soils. A 120-day 
      incubation study examined the effects of alkaline lignin on Cd, Pb and P
      bioavailability and transformation in Cd or Cd/Pb co-contaminated red and
      cinnamon soils and elucidated the associated mechanisms. A pot experiment further
      tested Cd accumulation in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in the
      Cd-contaminated red soil. The amendment of alkaline lignin increased the
      concentrations of bioavailable Cd by 13-20% in the acid red soil and 97-107% in
      the alkaline cinnamon soil, respectively, being due to the increase of dissolved 
      organic C concentrations. Meanwhile, it also increased the concentrations of
      available P in both soils, Al-P in red soil and Ca2-P in cinnamon soil.
      Consequently, alkaline lignin amendment increased lettuce biomass by 8-23% in
      shoots and by 56-71% in roots, P uptake by 37-50% in shoots and by 28-62% in
      roots, and limited Cd transport from root to shoot which decreased Cd
      concentrations by 26% in lettuce shoot (edible part). The results suggest that
      alkaline lignin increases plant growth and decreases Cd bioaccumulation in the
      shoot through restricting Cd translocation from the root to shoot and increasing 
      soil P availability but not Cd immobilization, and hence may have potential to
      reduce vegetable Cd contamination risk.

      Analysis Reveals a Potential Role of Lipopolysaccharide Pathway Proteins to Novel
      beta-lactam/beta-lactamase Inhibitor Combinations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Whole genome and transcriptome analysis of 213 Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      isolates resistant to antipseudomonal beta-lactams collected in 30 countries was 
      performed to evaluate resistance mechanisms against these agents. METHODS:
      Isolates were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution. Whole
      genome and transcriptome sequencing were performed, and data was analysed using
      open-source tools. A statistical analysis of changes in expression of >5,500
      genes was compared to the expression of PAO1. RESULTS: The high-risk clones ST235
      and ST111 were the most prevalent among >90 STs. Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBLs)
      genes were detected in 40 isolates. AmpC and MexXY were the most common genes
      overexpressed in approximately 50% of the 173 isolates that did not carry MBLs.
      Isolates overexpressing pmrA and pmrB, the norspermidine production genes speD2
      and speE2, and the operon arnBCADTEF-ugd were noted among strains resistant to
      ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam, despite the lack of polymyxin
      resistance often associated to increased expression of these genes.
      Overexpression of MuxABC-OpmB, OprG, and OprE proteins were associated with
      resistance to ceftolozane-tazobactam in addition to the usual genes involved in
      cephalosporin, monobactam, and carbapenem resistance. Statistical analysis
      identified discrete mutations in ArmZ, OprD, and AmpC that correlated to
      antipseudomonal beta-lactam resistance. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa resistance
      mechanisms are complex. This analysis suggests the role of multiple genes in
      resistance to antipseudomonal beta-lactams, including some not commonly
      described.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of olfactory disorder (OD) in patients with COVID-19 is
      unclear. Our study aimed to elucidate the relationships between inflammatory
      factors and OD in a sample of Omicron-infected patients with a high rate of
      vaccination in China. METHODS: The Sniffin' Sticks 12-item test (SST-12) was
      performed in a cross-sectional study of 148 recovered Omicron-infected patients
      to evaluate OD severity. We compared demographic, laboratory, and clinical data. 
      RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight Omicron-infected patients were enrolled. One
      hundred twenty-nine cases of OD were detected. Increased inflammation contributed
      to OD severity, especially in the adult group. OD was shown to be aggravated by
      an increase in IL-6 levels. The adjusted odds ratio was 2.22 (95% CI: 0.98-5.05, 
      P=0.056) after adjustment for age, sex and vaccine characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings indicated that the prevalence of OD remains high in vaccinated
      Omicron-infected patients and that SST-12 might be a feasible method to screen
      for OD. IL-6 may play a role in the biochemical and pathological processes
      underlying OD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: . SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has shown reduced infection severity;
      however, the reinfection frequency amongst unvaccinated, partially vaccinated and
      fully vaccinated remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the rates and
      associated factors for such occurrences. METHODS: . This retrospective
      epidemiological report included 1362 COVID-19 reinfection cases in Bahrain
      between April 2020 and July 2021. We analysed differences in disease severity and
      reinfection characteristics between various vaccination statuses; fully
      vaccinated, interrupted vaccination, one vaccination dose, post-reinfection
      vaccination and unvaccinated. RESULTS: . Reinfection cases increased from zero
      cases per month in April - June 2020 to a sharp peak of 579 reinfection cases in 
      May 2021. Males constituted a significantly larger proportion of reinfections
      (60.3%, p<0.0001). Reinfection episodes were highest amongst the 30-39 years of
      age (29.7%). The least reinfection episodes occurred at 3-6 months after the
      first infection (20.6%) and most occurred >/=9 months after initial infection
      (46.4%). Most individuals were asymptomatic during both episodes (35.7%),
      Reinfection disease severity was mild, with vaccinated patients less likely to
      have symptomatic reinfection (OR 0.71, p=0.004). Only 6.6% reinfection cases
      required hospitalization. One death was recorded, corresponding to unvaccinated
      group. CONCLUSION: . Vaccine-induced immunity and prior infection with or without
      vaccination were effective in reducing reinfection disease severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Predictors of postpartum severe maternal morbidity and mortality have
      not been well-described using patient-level data. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the
      application of maternal early warning criteria in the postpartum period and to
      generate a preliminary predictive model for severe maternal morbidity and
      mortality occurring after delivery hospitalization discharge until 42 days
      postpartum. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case control study was conducted from
      January 2013 to September 2020. Cases were identified from the electronic medical
      record using ICD-10 codes for Centers for Disease Control defined severe maternal
      morbidity. Patients meeting criteria for severe maternal morbidity and mortality 
      from delivery hospitalization discharge until 42 days postpartum were matched for
      delivery hospital and year with controls in an approximate 1:2 fashion. The
      objective was to identify demographic and clinical risk factors during the
      antepartum through postpartum periods for postpartum severe maternal morbidity
      and mortality. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to estimate
      risks and a receiver operating characteristic curve was derived to evaluate the
      model. RESULTS: Ninety cases of postpartum severe maternal morbidity and
      mortality were identified that occurred following delivery hospitalization
      discharge. These were matched with 175 controls. Women with postpartum severe
      maternal morbidity and mortality had more postpartum assessments (mean: 1.7 vs
      1.4, p=0.005) and a higher frequency of maternal early warning criteria (58%
      [52/90] vs 2% [3/175], p<0.001) preceding the diagnosis of severe maternal
      morbidity and mortality than controls. Black women had higher odds of postpartum 
      severe maternal morbidity and mortality than White women (OR 1.93, 95%CI
      1.14-3.27). Women with maternal early warning criteria during postpartum
      assessments were more likely to experience subsequent postpartum severe maternal 
      morbidity and mortality (OR 67.2, 95%CI 21.3-211.6) than women with no maternal
      early warning criteria. Although the point estimate was different in Black women 
      (OR 161.8, 95%CI 8.9->999) than White women (OR 47.9, 95%CI 13.8-167.1), the
      effect modification between MEWC and race was not statistically significant
      (p=0.93). In a multivariable model, race, body mass index, cesarean, and maternal
      early warning criteria at postpartum assessments were associated with subsequent 
      severe maternal morbidity and mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.905
      (95%CI 0.864-0.946). CONCLUSION: Maternal early warning criteria are associated
      with increased odds of postpartum severe maternal morbidity and mortality. A
      straightforward model that includes race, BMI, cesarean delivery, and the
      presence of maternal early warning criteria appears to be a promising tool to
      identify those at risk for postpartum severe maternal morbidity and mortality
      following delivery hospitalization discharge. This is an important first step in 
      improving the ability to recognize and respond to conditions preceding postpartum
      SMMM. These findings should be validated in a prospective cohort.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines excluded individuals
      with active reproductive needs (attempting to conceive, currently pregnant,
      and/or lactating). Women comprise three-quarters of healthcare workers in the
      United States, an occupational field among the first to receive the vaccine.
      Professional medical and government organizations encouraged shared
      decision-making and access to vaccination among those with active reproductive
      needs. OBJECTIVE: To characterize information sources used by pregnancy-capable
      healthcare workers for information about the COVID-19 vaccines, and to compare
      the self-reported "most important" source by respondents' active reproductive
      needs, if any. STUDY DESIGN: This was a web-based national survey of female,
      US-based healthcare workers in January 2021. Recruitment was conducted using
      social media and subsequent sharing via word of mouth. We classified respondents 
      into six groups based on self-reported reproductive needs: 1) preventing
      pregnancy, 2) attempting pregnancy, 3) currently pregnant, 4) lactating, 5)
      attempting pregnancy and lactating, and 6) currently pregnant and lactating. We
      provided respondents with a list of information sources (friends, family, OB-GYN,
      pediatrician, news, social media, government organizations, their employer, and
      "other") and asked respondents which source(s) they used when looking for
      information about the vaccine, and their most important source. We used
      descriptive statistics to characterize the information sources and compared the
      endorsement of government organizations and OB-GYN as the most important
      information source between reproductive groups using chi-square. Effect size was 
      calculated using Cramer's V. RESULTS: Our survey had 11,405 unique respondents:
      5,846 (51.3%) were preventing pregnancy, 955 (8.4%) were attempting pregnancy,
      2,196 (19.3%) were currently pregnant, 2,250 (19.7%) were lactating, 67 (0.6%)
      were attempting pregnancy and lactating, and 91 (0.8%) were currently pregnant
      and lactating. The most endorsed information sources were government
      organizations (88.7%), employers (48.5%), OB-GYN (44.9%), and social media
      (39.6%). For the most important information source, the distribution of
      respondents endorsing government organizations was different between reproductive
      groups (p<0.001), most common among respondents preventing pregnancy (62.6%) and 
      least common among those currently pregnant (31.5%). We observed an inverse
      pattern among respondents endorsing an OB-GYN as the most important source: the
      source was most common among currently pregnant respondents (51.4%) and least
      common among those preventing pregnancy (5.8%), p<0.001. The difference in
      endorsement of social media as an information source between groups was
      significant but had a small effect size. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers use
      government and professional medical organizations for information. Respondents
      attempting pregnancy, pregnant, and/or lactating are more likely to use social
      media and an OB-GYN as information sources for vaccine decision-making. This data
      can inform public health messaging and counseling for clinicians.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of sonographer discretion to terminate a venous duplex
      ultrasound for diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sonographers performing venous duplex ultrasounds (VDUS) in COVID-19 
      patients are placed at an increased risk for exposure due to close contact with
      these patients for an extended time period. The objective of this study was to
      evaluate the efficacy of a modified COVID-19 VDUS protocol in reducing
      sonographer exposure to COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a single center
      retrospective review. Subjects who underwent a VDUS under the modified COVID-19
      protocol between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, with a confirmed or presumed
      COVID-19 diagnosis at the time of VDUS were included. The modified COVID-19
      protocol was defined as the ability of the sonographer to terminate the
      examination upon detection of an acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The primary 
      outcome measures were the number of anatomic deep venous segments recorded by the
      sonographer, used as a surrogate measure for sonographer exposure time, and the
      number of acute DVTs on follow-up examinations in segments not visualized on
      index VDUS. RESULTS: One hundred sixty lower extremity venous duplex ultrasounds 
      (LEVDUS) and 72 upper extremity venous duplex ultrasounds (UEVDUS) were performed
      using the COVID-19 protocol. On index VDUS, 27.5% (44/160) of subjects who
      underwent LEVDUS and 36.6% (26/72) of subjects who underwent UEVDUS had an acute 
      DVT. On follow-up imaging 17.9% (7/38) of LEVDUS and 10% (1/10) of UEVDUS
      demonstrated a new acute DVT. Malignancy and surgery 30 days prior to imaging
      were significantly associated with acute lower extremity DVTs, while mechanical
      ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were associated with
      acute upper extremity DVTs. On index DUS, there were averages of 10.6 of 14 total
      visualized segments on LEVDUS and 6.4 of 10 total segments on UEVDUS. In total
      index VDUS, 35.6% of LEVDUS and 78.6% of UEVDUS were abbreviated. Index VDUS that
      were positive for acute DVT had significantly fewer visualized segments for both 
      lower (8.4 vs 11.5, p<0.0001) and upper extremities (4.2 vs 7.6, p<0.0001). On
      follow up examination, only 1 out of 8 new acute DVTs occurred in a subject whose
      index VDUS was abbreviated, and the corresponding segment not assessed. This
      finding did not impact the subject's clinical course. CONCLUSION: The modified
      COVID-19 VDUS protocol reduced sonographers' potential exposure time to COVID-19.
      Additionally, the clinical efficacy was maintained, with no missed DVTs despite
      the abbreviation of VDUS examinations.

LID - 10.1016/j.jvsv.2022.05.015 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Left iliac vein compression is associated with left iliac vein
      thrombosis (IVT), potentially limiting the migration of the thrombus from this
      stenotic segment to the pulmonary arteries. We sought to investigate the
      differences in clinical characteristics and risk factors of symptomatic pulmonary
      embolism (SPE) in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in different limbs and
      anatomical locations. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted in 1476
      patients with acute unilateral lower extremity DVT. Differences of clinical
      characteristics and risk factors between left-side and right-side DVT, IVT and
      non-IVT, cases with SPE and cases without SPE were compared. Risk factors for SPE
      were investigated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: SPE was more
      common in right-side DVT patients than left-side DVT patients (13.8% vs 7.0%,
      p<0.001). SPE incidence in left IVT, 5.4%, was lower than that in left non-IVT,
      right IVT and right non-IVT (12.8%, 10.1%, 16.6%, p<0.001). There was no
      difference in SPE incidence among patients with left non-IVT, right IVT and right
      non-IVT (p>0.05). In left-side DVT patients, male sex was associated with
      increased odds of SPE (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.10-2.85, P=0.02). IVT, surgery and
      immobilization were associated with decreased odds of SPE (OR:0.46, 95% CI:
      0.28-0.76, p<0.01; OR: 0.55, 95% CI:0.32-0.95, p=0.03; OR: 0.53, 95%
      CI:0.32-0.86, p=0.01). In right-side DVT patients, provoked DVT was associated
      with decreased odds of SPE (OR:0.50, 95% CI: 0.27-0.93, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Left
      IVT is associated with a lower SPE incidence than right-side DVT. Left IVT and
      may be a relative protective factor against SPE.

AB  - Bleomycin is a well-recognized antineoplastic drug. However, pulmonary fibrosis
      (PF) is considered to be the principal drawback that greatly limits its use.
      Here, we sought to investigate ability of the neurokinin receptor 1 blocker,
      aprepitant, to prevent PF caused by bleomycin. Male adult Wistar rat groups were 
      given a single intratracheal injection of bleomycin, either alone or in
      combination with aprepitant therapy for 3 or 14 days. Collagen deposition and a
      rise in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) immunoreactivity in lung
      tissue serve as evidence of bleomycin-induced PF. The serum levels of lactate
      dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and total antioxidant improved after
      aprepitant therapy.Additionally, it reduced the protein expressions of interferon
      alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and lung lipid peroxidation. Moreover,
      aprepitant treatment led to an increase in the antioxidant indices glutathione,
      glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. Aprepitant is postulated to protect against
      bleomycin-induced PF by decreasing TGF-beta, phosphorylating Smad3, and
      increasing interleukin 37, an anti-fibrotic cytokine, and G Protein-coupled
      Receptor Kinase 2. Aprepitant for 14 days considerably exceeded aprepitant for 3 
      days in terms of improving lung damage and having an anti-fibrotic impact. In
      conclusion, aprepitant treatment for 14 days may be used as an adjuvant to
      bleomycin therapy to prevent PF, mostly through inhibiting the TGF-/p-Smad3
      fibrotic pathway.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors affecting
      telomere length (TL) in coke oven workers by analyzing the interaction between
      miRNAs polymorphisms and coke oven emissions (COEs) exposure. METHODS: A total of
      544 coke oven workers and 238 healthy controls were recruited. Peripheral blood
      was collected from the subjects, genomic DNA was extracted, leukocyte TL was
      detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and fifteen
      polymorphisms of eight miRNAs were genotyped by flight mass spectrometry.
      RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that the peripheral blood DNA TL in the
      exposure group was shorter than that in the control group (P < 0.001).
      Generalized linear model found that COEs-exposure [beta (95%CI) = -0.427 (-0.556,
      -0.299), P < 0.001], genotype CC+CT for miR-612 rs1144925 [beta (95%CI) = -0.367 
      (-0.630, -0.104), P = 0.006], and the interaction of miR-181B1 rs12039395 TT
      genotype and COEs-exposure [beta (95% CI) = 0.564 (0.108, 1.020), P = 0.015] were
      associated with the shortened TL. CONCLUSION: COEs-exposure and miR-612 rs1144925
      TT could promote telomere shortening in coke oven workers. The interaction of
      miR-181B1 rs12039395 TT genotype and COEs-exposure could protect telomere. This
      provides clues for further mechanistic studies between miRNA and telomere damage.

LID - 10.1053/j.semtcvs.2022.07.010 [doi]
AB  - The match rate for traditional thoracic surgery fellowships decreased from 97.5% 
      in 2012 to 59.1% in 2021, reflecting an increase in applications. We queried
      whether characteristics of applicants and matriculants to traditional thoracic
      surgery fellowships changed during this time period. Applicant data from the 2008
      through 2018 application cycles were extracted from the Electronic Residency
      Application System (ERAS) and Graduate Medical Education (GME) Track Resident
      Survey and stratified by period of application (2008-2014 vs. 2015-2018).
      Characteristics of applicants and matriculants were analyzed. There were 697
      applicant records in the early period and 530 in the recent period (application
      rate 99.6/year vs 132.5/year; p=0.0005), and 607 matriculant records in the early
      period and 383 in the recent period (matriculation rate 87% vs 72%; p<0.0001).
      There was no difference in representation of University Affiliated versus
      Community Based general surgery residency programs among applicants comparing the
      periods. Higher proportions of applicants and matriculants in the early period
      trained in general surgery programs affiliated with a comprehensive cancer center
      or a thoracic surgery fellowship. Applicants and matriculants of the recent
      period had higher median numbers of journal publications and had higher impact
      factor journal publications. The increase in applicants for thoracic surgery
      training is primarily from general surgery trainees in residency programs not
      affiliated with a comprehensive cancer center or a thoracic surgery fellowship.
      The increased interest in thoracic surgery training was accompanied by overall
      enhanced scholarship production among the applicants and matriculants regardless 
      of their residency characteristics.

LID - 10.1053/j.semtcvs.2022.07.009 [doi]
AB  - To investigate predictors of intervention of acute type B aortic penetrating
      ulcer (PAU) and intramural hematoma (IMH). We conducted a retrospective chart
      review of all patients admitted for acute type B PAU or IMH in a tertiary
      referral hospital. Indications to intervention were "complicated" (rupture,
      impending rupture, malperfusion) or "high risk for unfavorable outcome"
      (refractory hypertension and/or pain despite best medical treatment, morphologic 
      aortic evolution, transition to a new aortic syndrome, or increase in IMH/PAU
      depth >5 mm) during the acute/subacute phase. The primary outcomes were overall
      mortality, aortic-related mortality, and freedom from intervention.
      Time-dependent outcomes were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox proportional
      hazards models were used to identify predictors of intervention and mortality.
      There were 54 acute aortic syndromes, 37 PAUs and 17 IMHs. Mean age was 69+/-14
      years and 33 patients (62.2%) were male. Six (11.5%) patients had complicated
      aortic syndromes and underwent urgent repair. Two (3.7%) additional patients
      developed an impending rupture during the acute phase. Eleven (21.1%) patients
      were classified as at "high risk" during the initial hospitalization. Overall, 22
      (40.7%) patients required an aortic intervention during the initial admission
      (n=16, 72.7% during the acute phase; n=6, 27.3% during the subacute phase).
      In-hospital mortality was 5.5% (1 PAU and 2 IMH), and was aorta-related in all
      cases. For IMH, disease extension in >3 aortic zones (HR 1.94, 95%CI 1.17-32.6;
      P=.038) and presence of ulcer-like projections (ULPs) (HR 1.23, 95%CI 1.02-9.41; 
      P=.042) were associated with the need for intervention. There were no
      aortic-related deaths or intervention during the chronic phase. PAU width > 20 mm
      (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.07-16.08; P=.014), PAU depth >15 mm (HR 6.74, 95%CI 1.31-34.18;
      P=021), PAU depth/total aortic diameter >0.3 (HR 4.31, 95%CI 1.17-20.32; P=.043),
      and location at the level of the paravisceral aorta (HR 2.24, 95%CI 1.23-4.70;
      P=.035) were significantly associated with need for intervention. Six additional 
      (16.2%) PAUs required intervention during the chronic phase owing to PAU growth. 
      Maximum aortic diameter >35 mm was significantly associated with intervention (HR
      1.45, 95%CI 1.00-2.32; P=.037). Acute symptomatic type B IMHs and PAUs are
      characterized by a high risk of complications during the first month from
      presentation. Morphologic features associated with intervention were IMH with
      ULPs or extension in more than 3 aortic zones, as well as PAUs with depth>15 mm, 
      width >20 mm, or depth/aortic diameter ratio>0.3. A strict follow-up protocol or 
      consideration for early intervention within 30 days from presentation should be
      taken into account for these high-risk patients. During the chronic phase imaging
      follow-up is particularly important for PAUs in order to identify progression to 
      saccular aneurysms.

AB  - Tricuspid regurgitation(TR) severity after mitral TEER has been shown to impact
      outcomes but unknown in patients requiring mitral valve(MV) surgery after TEER.
      We sought to determine the impact of preoperative TR severity and right
      ventricular(RV) dysfunction on MV surgery after TEER. From 7/2009 to 7/2020,
      260/332 patients in the CUTTING-EDGE registry who underwent MV surgery after TEER
      had paired echocardiographic evaluation on TR severity, and >/=moderate(2+)
      versus <2+ TR at the time of index TEER were compared. Median follow-up post MV
      surgery was 9.1 months, 96.5% complete at 30 days and 81.9% complete at 1 year.
      Mean age was 73.8+/-10.3; with primary/mixed and secondary MR present in 65.6%
      and 32.0%, respectively. Proportion of >/=2+TR increased from TEER to MV surgery 
      (40% vs 57%, p<0.001). Compared to <2+ TR group, >/=2+ pre-TEER TR patients were 
      older, had higher STS risk score at TEER, higher RVSP, more RV dysfunction, more 
      MR post-TEER, and a shorter median interval from TEER to MV surgery (1.9 vs 4.9
      months, p=0.023). Mortality was higher in the >/=2+ pre-TEER TR group at 30-days 
      (24.2% vs 13.8%, p=0.043) and 1-year (45.3% vs 22.3%, p=0.003). On Kaplan-Meier
      analysis, cumulative mortality was 23.8% at 1-year and 31.6% at 3-years after MV 
      surgery overall, and was associated with pre-operative RV dysfunction(p=0.023),
      >/=2+TR at pre-TEER(p=0.001) and pre-surgery(p=0.004), but not concomitant
      tricuspid surgery. Moderate or greater pre-TEER TR was associated with worse
      outcomes, and pre-TEER TR worsened significantly at MV surgery. Concomitant
      tricuspid surgery did not increase overall mortality.

TI  - Impact of subjective evaluations in predicting response to ventriculo-peritoneal 
      shunt for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.
LID - S1878-8750(22)01034-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2022.07.087 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) tap test is one common procedure to
      predict the efficiency of ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt for idiopathic normal 
      pressure hydrocephalus(iNPH). Objective tests after CSF tap test were used to
      establish the surgical indication, but subjective improvements may also be
      important in the selection of surgical candidates. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the surgical outcomes of our cohort of patients with VP shunt for iNPH, 
      comparing the cohort of patients showing objective improvement with those
      improving only at subjective assessments. METHODS: We performed a retrospective
      analysis. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 included patients with
      an improvement at objective evaluations after CSF tap test; group 2 included
      patients showing only a subjective improvement. We compared the surgical outcomes
      of the two groups. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included in our analysis: 
      17objective responders (group 1) and 11subjective responders (group 2). Clinical 
      and radiological characteristics were similar. The only significant difference
      was the baseline Berg Balance Scale, which was lower in the objective responders 
      (p=0.0015). At 3 months after surgery and at last follow-up, there was no
      difference in terms of surgical outcomes between the two groups. However, in the 
      group of subjective responders a continuous improvement for incontinence and gait
      was more frequently observed (p=0.04 and p<0.001 respectively). CONCLUSION: The
      surgical outcomes after VP shunt were similar between the two groups, with a more
      favorable trend in terms of symptoms improvement for subjective responders. The
      subjective assessment seems to be an important factor to consider in preoperative
      evaluations.

TI  - Timeline of Occlusion for Intracranial Aneurysms Treated with the Pipeline
      Embolization Device.
LID - S1878-8750(22)01032-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2022.07.084 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rates of aneurysm occlusion following treatment with flow diverting
      stents have been quantified at pre-defined timepoints in clinical trials, but
      data characterizing the continuous temporal progression of aneurysm occlusion is 
      lacking. In this study, we utilize real-world variability in the timing of
      angiographic follow-up to characterize the timeline of aneurysm occlusion
      following treatment with the Pipeline Embolization Device. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      All aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device at our institution
      between 2011 and 2020 were screened. Non-saccular or ruptured aneurysms were
      excluded. Aneurysm occlusion status and time since treatment were recorded for
      each follow up angiogram. Aneurysm occlusion was characterized using Kaplan-Meier
      and Cox proportional hazards analysis after censoring at last follow up or
      subsequent treatment. RESULTS: 290 aneurysms in 222 patients were analyzed. The
      median time of observed aneurysm occlusion was 7.5 months, and the overall rate
      of aneurysm occlusion was 77.9%. Larger aneurysms demonstrated longer median time
      to occlusion and lower rate of aneurysm occlusion (p=0.029). There were no
      observed differences in the timeline of occlusion for aneurysms treated with a
      single PED or multiple PEDs (p=0.889), or without or with adjunctive coiling
      (p=0.771). CONCLUSION: Aneurysms treated with PED had median time to observed
      occlusion of 7.5 months. Larger aneurysms occluded more slowly than smaller
      aneurysms following flow diversion. The number of PEDs deployed or the use of
      adjunctive coiling did not affect the timeline or likelihood of aneurysm
      occlusion. These findings may guide optimum timing of follow up after treatment
      with PED.

TI  - Timing of revascularization in ischemic Moyamoya disease: association of early
      versus delayed surgery with perioperative and long-term outcomes.
LID - S1878-8750(22)01038-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2022.07.090 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Moyamoya disease (MMD) patients who present primarily with ischemic
      stroke are known to have higher rates of perioperative strokes as compared with
      those who present with non-stroke symptoms. The optimal timing for
      revascularization for these patients remains unclear. METHODS: From 1994-2015, 91
      MMD patients presented with signs and symptoms of an acute ischemic stroke with
      diffusion restriction correlate on MRI, and these patients were subdivided into
      those who underwent early revascularization (<90 days from last stroke), versus
      those who underwent delayed revascularization (>/=90 days after last stroke),
      based on evidence that most neurological recovery after stroke occurs during the 
      first three months. Perioperative and long-term outcomes were compared between
      the two surgical cohorts. RESULTS: 27 patients underwent early revascularization,
      and 64 patients underwent delayed revascularization. Patients who underwent early
      revascularization had a statistically higher rate of perioperative stroke
      (p=0.04) and perioperative mortality (p=0.03), and overall complication rate
      (p=0.049). At last follow up of 5.2 +/- 4.3 years, patients who underwent delayed
      revascularization had a lower mortality rate (p=0.01) and a lower overall
      post-operative stroke incidence (p=0.002). As a function of time, MMD patients
      undergoing delayed revascularization had a statistically higher length of
      stroke-free survival (p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: MMD patients who present with
      ischemic stroke are more likely to have perioperative strokes, overall
      perioperative complications, worse long-term mortality rates, and lower rates of 
      stroke-free survival if revascularization surgery occurred within 90 days of last
      stroke.

TI  - Does improved external rotation following reverse shoulder arthroplasty impact
      clinical outcomes in patients with rotator cuff pathology and external rotation
      less than zero degrees?

LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2022.06.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to (1) evaluate whether improved
      external rotation (ER) in patients with preoperative ER < 0 degrees impacts their
      clinical outcomes following reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) for rotator cuff 
      (RC) pathology, and (2) describe the differences in preoperative factors and
      postoperative outcomes in this patient population. Our hypothesis was that
      clinical outcomes would not be impacted by improvement in ER using a lateralized 
      glenosphere design. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 55 patients with
      preoperative ER < 0 degrees who underwent primary RSA for RC pathology with
      lateralized glenosphere. Pre- and postoperative physician-reported ER was blindly
      measured using a videographic review of patients externally rotating their arm at
      the side. Patients were evaluated using 5 different patient reported outcome
      score thresholds, measured at 12 months postoperatively: 1) Minimal Clinical
      Difference (MCID) for ASES (i.e. >/= 20 point increase); 2) MCID SST (>/= 2.4
      increase); 3) VAS pain > 0; 4) mean ASES (>/= 75); and 5) mean SST (>/= 6.8),
      each of which was used to stratify the patients into two groups 1) greater than
      or equal (>/=) vs. less than (<) the threshold. This resulted in 5 different
      evaluations comparing the group >/= to the one < the threshold for any difference
      in postoperative ER or preoperative factors, including Hamada and Goutallier
      scores. RESULTS: Regardless of the measured outcome, there was no difference in
      either postoperative physician- or patient-reported ER between patients who
      achieved scores higher or lower than the thresholds. Both Hamada and Goutallier
      score distribution were not different between groups across all the evaluated
      outcomes. Patients who achieved the MCID for ASES had worse preoperative VAS pain
      (7 vs 4, p = 0.011) and SST (1 vs 3, p = 0.020) scores. Across all outcome
      thresholds, except MCID for SST, pain reduction (DeltaVAS) was significantly more
      pronounced in patients exceeding the thresholds. Improved forward flexion rather 
      than ER was observed in those who achieved the ASES (160 degrees vs 80 degrees , 
      p=0.020) and SST MCID (150 degrees vs 90 degrees , p=0.037). Finally, patients
      who exceeded the thresholds experienced higher satisfaction rates. CONCLUSION:
      Improvement in ER does not appear to impact patient-reported outcome measures,
      including ASES and SST in patients with preoperative ER < 0 degrees undergoing
      RSA with a lateralized glenosphere. Patients with more severe pain and worse
      function at baseline experience less postoperative pain and clinically
      significant improvement in their reported outcomes.

TI  - Validation of 3D MRI in Glenohumeral Instability Evaluation of Glenoid and
      Humeral Bone Loss including Glenoid Track Compared to CT Scan.
LID - S1058-2746(22)00600-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2022.06.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine whether the addition of 3-dimensional (3D) MRI to
      standard MRI sequences is comparable to 3D CT scan evaluation of glenoid and
      humeral bone loss in glenohumeral instability. METHODS: Eighteen patients who
      presented with glenohumeral instability were prospectively enrolled and received 
      both MRI and CT within 1 week of each other. The MRI included an additional
      sequence (VIBE) which underwent post-processing for reformations (Figure 1a). The
      addition of a VIBE protocol, on average is an addition 4 to 4.5minutes in the
      scanner. CT data also underwent 3D post-processing (Figure 1b) and therefore each
      patient had four imaging modalities (2D CT, 2D MRI, 3D CT reformats, and 3D MRI
      reformats). Each sequence underwent the following measurements from two separate 
      reviewers: glenoid defect, glenoid defect percent, humeral defect, humeral defect
      percentage (Figure 2a and 2b), and evaluation of glenoid track and version.
      Paired t-tests were used to assess differences between imaging modalities and chi
      squared for glenoid track. Intra-observer and inter-observer reliability were
      evaluated. Bland-Altman tests were also performed to assess the agreement between
      CT and MRI. In addition, we determined cost of each imaging modality at our
      single institution. RESULTS: 3D MRI measurements for glenoid and humeral bone
      loss measurements were comparable to 3D CT (Table 1). There were no significant
      differences for glenoid defect size and percentage, or humeral defect size and
      percentage (P>0.05) (Table 2). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated strong
      agreement with small measurement errors for 3D CT and 3D MRI percentage glenoid
      bone loss (Figure 3). There was also no difference in evaluation for determining 
      on vs off track between any of the imaging modalities. Inter- and intra-rater
      reliability was good to excellent for all CT and MRI measurements (r >= 0.7).
      CONCLUSION: 3D MRI measurements for bone loss in glenohumeral instability through
      utilization of VIBE sequence were equivalent to 3D CT. At our institution, the
      costs of MRI with 3D reconstruction was 1.67x cheaper than MRI and CT with 3D
      reconstructions. 3D MRI may be a useful adjuvant to standard MRI sequences to
      allow concurrent soft tissue and accurate assessment of glenoid and humeral bone 
      loss in glenohumeral instability.

TI  - New bone formation after arthroscopic Bankart repair for unstable shoulders with 
      an erosion-type glenoid defect.
LID - S1058-2746(22)00577-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2022.06.013 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate new bone formation after arthroscopic
      Bankart repair (ABR) and the influence of new bone formation on recurrence in
      shoulders with an erosion-type glenoid defect. METHODS: We analyzed data on
      shoulders with an erosion-type glenoid defect. Participants were patients who
      underwent computed tomography to evaluate new bone formation after ABR performed 
      from 2004 to 2021 and were followed for a minimum of 2 years. We investigated the
      factors influencing new bone formation, in particular the presence of an
      intraoperative bone fragment, and the influence of new bone formation and its
      size on postoperative recurrence. RESULTS: A total of 100 shoulders were
      included. The mean glenoid defect size was 10.1+/-6.3% (range, 1.2% to 31.5%).
      New bone formed postoperatively in 15 shoulders (15.0%) and was seen in
      significantly more shoulders with an intraoperative bone fragment (11/18, 61.1%) 
      than in those without a fragment (4/82, 4.9%; p<0.001). Recurrence occurred in 22
      shoulders (22.0%), and the rate of recurrence was not different between shoulders
      with new bone formation (3/15, 20.0%) and without new bone formation (19/85,
      22.4%; p=0.999). Among the 15 shoulders with new bone formation, the size of the 
      new bone fragments relative to glenoid width was less than 5% in 2 shoulders, 5% 
      to less than 7.5% in 8 shoulders, 7.5% to less than 10% in 3 shoulders, and 10%
      or more in 2 shoulders; in all 3 shoulders with postoperative recurrence, the
      relative size was less than 7.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Even in shoulders with an
      erosion-type glenoid defect, new bone may form after ABR, especially in shoulders
      with an intraoperative bone fragment. However, new bone formation does not
      decrease the rate of postoperative recurrence.

TI  - Kinetic and Kinematic Comparisons in High School Pitchers with Low and High Pitch
      Location Consistency.
LID - S1058-2746(22)00575-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2022.06.011 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: While the performance metric ball velocity has often been associated
      with increased kinetics at the upper extremity and risk of injury in youth and
      adolescent pitchers, it is unclear if the performance metric pitch location
      consistency has any positive/negative associations with pitching kinetics.
      METHODS: High school pitchers(n=59) pitched 8-12 fastballs using 3D
      motion-capture(480 Hz). Pitchers were divided into high consistency(HiCon) and
      low consistency(LoCon) groups based on the absolute center deviation of each
      pitcher's pitch to the center of the pitchers mean pitch location. 95% confidence
      ellipses with major and minor radii were constructed, while kinematics and
      kinetics were compared. RESULTS: HiCon pitchers had decreased lead hip flexion at
      elbow extension(40+/-12 degrees vs. 52+/-13 degrees respectfully, p=0.008) while 
      at foot contact, decreased back hip extension(1+/-10 degrees vs. 10+/-13 degrees 
      respectfully, p=0.038) and increased back hip internal rotation(9+/-15 degrees
      vs. -2+/-15 degrees respectfully, p=0.043). LoCon pitchers achieved maximum lead 
      hip flexion earlier(61.3+/-23.2% vs. 75.8+/-15.1% respectfully, p=0.039). A
      multi-regression model could predict 0.49 of variance in pitch location
      consistency using kinematic inputs. CONCLUSION: Pitchers who differ in pitch
      location consistency outcomes do not appear to demonstrate physiologically unsafe
      kinematics. High school pitchers who strive for improved pitch consistency can
      consider adjusting parameters of hip kinematics during early portions of the
      pitch.

TI  - Posteroinferior Relevant Scapular Neck Offset (pRSNO) in Reverse Shoulder
      Arthroplasty: Key player for motion and friction-type impingement in a computer
      model.
LID - S1058-2746(22)00578-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2022.06.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Range of Motion (ROM) and prevention of notching remain a challenge
      for Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty (RSA). Both may be affected by the morphology
      of the scapula. The purpose of this study was to define anteroinferior (a) and
      posteroinferior (p) Relevant Scapular Neck Offset (RSNO) and to examine the
      hypothesis that pRSNO is significantly smaller than aRSNO, and influences Rigid
      Body Motion (RBM). Adapting glenosphere implantation strategies may therefore be 
      of value. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this computer model study (Blueprint software,
      Imascap) we used deidentified CT scans of 22 patients (11 male/female; mean age: 
      72.9 years) with massive cuff tears without joint space narrowing. Eight RSA
      glenoid configurations were tested with a constant neck-shaft angle (145 degrees 
      ). Two base plate (BP) types (25mm; 25mm+3mm lateralized) and four glenospheres
      (GS) (36 mm; 36mm+2mm eccentricity; 39mm; 39mm+3mm) were used. RSNO was defined
      as the standardized measurement of the horizontal distance from the inferior
      extent of the GS to the bony margin of the scapula after BP positioning (flush to
      inferior glenoid extent; neutral position: 0 degrees inclination; 0 degrees
      version; both software computed). RESULTS: There was a highly significant
      difference between pRSNO and aRSNO for both genders (p<0.00001). pRSNO was always
      smaller than aRSNO. pRSNO was strongly correlated with external rotation (ERO:
      0.84) and extension (EXT: 0.74) and moderately correlated with global ROM (GROM: 
      0.68). There was a moderately strong correlation between aRSNO and internal
      rotation (IRO: 0.69). pRSNO was strongly correlated with aRSNO, EXT, ERO, IRO,
      adduction (ADD) and GROM (0.82; 0.72; 0,8; 0.71; 0.82; 0.76) in females and with 
      EXT and ERO (0.82; 0.89) in males. The median pRSNO allowing for at least 45
      degrees ERO/40 degrees EXT was 14.2mm for males and 13.8mm for females. For all
      patients and models, pRSNO>/=14mm increased EXT, ERO, and GROM significantly
      compared to pRSNO<14mm (p<0.00001). The combination of lateralization and
      inferior overhang (eccentricity) lead to the most significant increase of pRSNO
      for each GS size (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION: This is one of the first RSA modeling
      studies evaluating non-arthritic glenoids of both genders. The lateral scapular
      extent to glenoid relationship is asymmetric. pRSNO is always smaller than aRSNO 
      for both genders, and was a critical variable for EXT and ERO demonstrating
      additional strong correlation with aRSNO, IRO, ADD and GROM in females.
      pRSNO>/=14mm was a safe value to prevent friction-type impingement. Combining
      increased glenosphere size, lateralization and inferior overhang gives the best
      results in this computer simulated setting.

TI  - Reverse Total Shoulder Glenoid Component Inclination Affects Glenohumeral
      Kinetics During Abduction: A Cadaveric Study.

LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2022.06.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal implant placement in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty
      (rTSA) remains controversial. Specifically, the optimal glenoid inclination is
      unknown. Therefore, a cadaveric shoulder simulator with 3D human motion specific 
      to rTSA was used to study joint contact and muscle forces as a function of
      glenoid component inclination. METHODS: Eight human cadaver shoulders were tested
      before and after rTSA implantation. Scapular plane abduction kinematics from
      control subjects and those with rTSA drove a cadaveric shoulder simulator with 3D
      scapulothoracic and glenohumeral motion. Glenoid inclination varied from -20
      masculine to +20 masculine. Outputs included compression, superior-inferior (S/I)
      shear, and anterior-posterior (A/P) shear forces from a 6 degree of freedom
      loadcell in the joint, and deltoid and rotator cuff muscle forces. Data were
      evaluated with statistical parametric mapping and t-tests. RESULTS: Inferior
      glenoid inclination (-) reduced S/I shear by up to 125% relative to superior
      inclination, with similar compression to the neutral condition (0 degrees ).
      Superior inclinations (+) increased the S/I shear force by approximately the same
      magnitude, yet decreased compression by 25% in the most superior inclination (+20
      degrees ). There were few differences in deltoid or rotator cuff forces due to
      inclination. Only the middle deltoid decreased by approximately 7% for the most
      inferior inclination (-20 degrees ). Compared to native shoulders, the neutral (0
      degrees ) rTSA inclination showed reduced forces of 30-75% in the anterior
      deltoid, and a trend toward decreased forces in the middle deltoid. Force demands
      on the rotator cuff varied as a function of elevation, with a trend toward
      increased forces in rTSA at peak glenohumeral elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Inferior
      inclination reduces superior shear forces, without influencing compression.
      Superior inclination increased S/I shear, while decreasing compression, which may
      be a source of component loosening and joint instability after rTSA. Inferior
      inclination of the rTSA glenoid may reduce the likelihood of glenoid loosening by
      reducing the magnitude of cyclic shear and compressive loading during arm
      elevation activities, although this may be altered by specific-subject body
      habitus and motion. These factors are especially important in revision rTSA or
      glenoid bone grafting where there is already a 3-fold increase in glenoid
      baseplate loosening versus primary rTSA.

TI  - Standardized incidence ratios and risk factors for cancer in patients with
      systemic sclerosis: Data from the Spanish Scleroderma Registry (RESCLE).

AB  - AIM: Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) are at increased risk of cancer, a
      growing cause of non-SSc-related death among these patients. We analyzed the
      increased cancer risk among Spanish patients with SSc using standardized
      incidence ratios (SIRs) and identified independent cancer risk factors in this
      population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Spanish Scleroderma Registry data were analyzed
      to determine the demographic characteristics of patients with SSc, and logistic
      regression was used to identify cancer risk factors. SIRs with 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) relative to the general Spanish population were calculated.
      RESULTS: Of 1930 patients with SSc, 206 had cancer, most commonly breast, lung,
      hematological, and colorectal cancers. Patients with SSc had increased risks of
      overall cancer (SIR 1.48, 95% CI 1.36-1.60; P<0.001), and of lung (SIR 2.22, 95% 
      CI 1.77-2.73; P<0.001), breast (SIR 1.31, 95% CI 1.10-1.54; P=0.003), and
      hematological (SIR 2.03, 95% CI 1.52-2.62; P<0.001) cancers. Cancer was
      associated with older age at SSc onset (odds ratio [OR] 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.03;
      P<0.001), the presence of primary biliary cholangitis (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.18-4.68;
      P=0.015) and forced vital capacity <70% (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.24-2.70; P=0.002). The 
      presence of anticentromere antibodies lowered the risk of cancer (OR 0.66, 95% CI
      0.45-0.97; P=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Spanish patients with SSc had an increased
      cancer risk compared with the general population. Some characteristics, including
      specific autoantibodies, may be related to this increased risk.

AB  - Lateralization is a fundamental characteristic of many behaviors and the
      organization of the brain, and atypical lateralization has been suggested to be
      linked to various brain-related disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.
      Right-handedness is one of the most prominent markers of human behavioural
      lateralization, yet its neurobiological basis remains to be determined. Here, we 
      present a large-scale analysis of handedness, as measured by self-reported
      direction of hand preference, and its variability related to brain structural and
      functional organization in the UK Biobank (N=36,024). A multivariate machine
      learning approach with multi-modalities of brain imaging data was adopted, to
      reveal how well brain imaging features could predict individual's handedness
      (i.e., right-handedness vs. non-right-handedness) and further identify the top
      brain signatures that contributed to the prediction. Overall, the results showed 
      a good prediction performance, with an area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve (AUROC) score of up to 0.72, driven largely by resting-state
      functional measures. Virtual lesion analysis and large-scale decoding analysis
      suggested that the brain networks with the highest importance in the prediction
      showed functional relevance to hand movement and several higher-level cognitive
      functions including language, arithmetic, and social interaction. Genetic
      analyses of contributions of common DNA polymorphisms to the imaging-derived
      handedness prediction score showed a significant heritability (h(2)=7.55%, p
      <0.001) that was similar to and slightly higher than that for the behavioural
      measure itself (h(2)=6.74%, p <0.001). The genetic correlation between the two
      was high (rg=0.71), suggesting that the imaging-derived score could be used as a 
      surrogate in genetic studies where the behavioural measure is not available. This
      large-scale study using multimodal brain imaging and multivariate machine
      learning has shed new light on the neural correlates of human handedness.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In the long history of traditional Chinese
      medicine, Panax notoginseng has been used as a key herb for the treatment ofblood
      diseases. Brain microvessels support adequate blood circulation to maintain
      normal physiological function, therefore, brain microcirculation disorder is an
      important therapeutic target for various brain diseases. However, the role of
      Xueshuantong (XST) injection composed of saponins from P. Notoginseng (PNS) in
      the amelioration of cerebral microcirculation disorder is unclear. AIMS OF THE
      STUDY: Cerebral microcirculation disorder and inflammation play a vital role in
      stroke. Capillary endothelial cells and adjacent tight junctions are fundamental 
      to the structure and function of cerebrovascule. XST injection has been used
      clinically in the treatment of stroke, but no studies have reported its
      indication in cerebral microcirculation disorder. This study is to explore the
      action and mechanism of XST injection in the alleviation of cerebral
      microcirculation disorder in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion
      (MCAO/R) rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCAO/R rats and LPS-induced bEnd.3cells
      were employed for the investigation of effect and mechanism of XST injection.
      Brain damages were evaluated by neurobehavioral assessment, 2, 3,
      5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining
      (H&E), and Nissl staining. Morphology and density changes of cerebral
      microvessels were monitored by immunohistochemistry. Cell permeability was
      detected by measurement of trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and
      sodium fluorescein (NaF) leakage. The mRNA and protein expressions of
      inflammatory cytokines, tight junction proteins, adhesion molecules, janus kinase
      2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), inhibitor
      of NF-kappaB (IkappaB), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-jun N-terminal
      kinase (JNK) in brain microvessels and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
      bEnd.3cells were measured by real-time PCR and western blot, respectively.
      RESULTS: XST injection at 48mg/kg significantly improved the neurological damage,
      inflammatory infiltration, and microvessel morphology, and increased microvessel 
      density in brain of MCAO/R rats. The endothelial permeability was significantly
      mitigated by XST in LPS-induced bEnd.3cells. Meanwhile, the tight junction
      proteins such as zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) and occludin were elevated remarkably in
      brain microvessel of MCAO/R rats and LPS-induced bEnd.3cells. Moreover, the
      expression of inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6,
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),
      cycloocygenases 2 (COX-2), vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), matrix
      metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 were inhibited by XST. In addition, XST
      suppressed the phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, IkappaB, NF-kappaB and JNK, which 
      could be abolished by anisomycin, the JNK agonist. CONCLUSION: XST injection
      improved cerebral microvescular structure damage and dysfunction in MCAO/R rats
      through inhibiting inflammation activated by JNK mediated JAK2/STAT3 and
      NF-kappaB signaling pathways. The novel findings may provide theoretical basis
      for the clinical application in the treatment of cerebral microcirculation
      disorder.

AB  - Pullulan-based composite films incorporated with bacterial cellulose (BC) and
      ferulic acid (FA) were prepared by solution casting method. The rheological,
      morphological, barrier, optical, anti-fogging, and antioxidant properties of
      pullulan-based composite films doped with BC and FA were investigated. The
      rheological results showed that all film-forming solution was pseudoplastic fluid
      and its viscosity increased with the increase of BC content. An appropriate BC
      (2%) and FA were uniformly dispersed in pullulan to form uniform and dense
      composite films. With the increase of BC content, the roughness and opacity of
      composite films increased while their UV-vis barrier performance was improved by 
      incorporating BC and FA. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer analysis
      demonstrated that hydrogen bond interactions among pullulan, BC, and FA were
      found, and incorporating BC could increase the crystallinity of the composite
      films, thus enhancing their mechanical, barrier, hydrophobic, and thermal
      stability properties. Pullulan-based composite films incorporated with 2%BC and
      FA (P-BC2-FA) showed better mechanical properties, water, oxygen, and carbon
      dioxide barrier performances, and its water contact angle value also increased
      compared with control, respectively. P-BC2-FA film showed superior anti-fogging
      and antioxidant activities. These results indicate that the P-BC2-FA films are
      expected to be a potential target of bioactive packaging.

AB  - To explore the microbial nitrogen metabolism of a two-stage anoxic/oxic
      (A/O)-moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR), biofilms of the system's chambers were
      analyzed using metagenomic sequencing. Significant differences in microbial
      populations were found among the pre-anoxic, oxic and post-anoxic MBBRs (P <
      0.01). Nitrospira and Nitrosomonas had positive correlations with ammonia
      nitrogen (NH4(+)-N) removal, and were also predominant in oxic MBBRs. These
      organisms were the hosts of functional genes for nitrification. The denitrifying 
      genera were predominant in anoxic MBBRs, including Thiobacillus and Sulfurisoma
      in pre-anoxic MBBRs and Dechloromonas and Thauera in post-anoxic MBBRs. The four 
      genera had positive correlations with total nitrate and nitrite nitrogen
      (NOX(-)-N) removal and were the hosts of functional genes for denitrification.
      Specific functional biofilms with different microbial nitrogen metabolisms were
      formed in each chamber of this system. This work provides a microbial theoretical
      support for the two-stage A/O-MBBR system.

AB  - In rodents, early-life exposure to environmental stress or antidepressant
      medication treatment has been shown to induce similar long-term consequences on
      memory- and depression-related behavior in adulthood. To expand on this line of
      work, we evaluated how juvenile exposure to chronic variable stress (CVS) or the 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) influences conditioned
      taste aversion (CTA) learning in adulthood. To do this, in Experiment 1, we
      examined how adolescent CVS alone (postnatal day [PND] 35-48), or with prenatal
      stress (PNS) history (PNS+CVS), influenced the acquisition and extinction of CTA 
      in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. Specifically, at PND70+ (adulthood), rats were
      presented with 0.15% saccharin followed by an intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of 
      lithium chloride (LiCl) to induce visceral malaise. A total of four saccharin
      (conditioned stimulus) and LiCl (unconditioned stimulus) pairings occurred across
      the CTA acquisition phase. Next, saccharin was presented without aversive
      consequences, and intake was measured across consecutive days of the extinction
      phase. No differences in body weight gain across the experimental days, rate of
      CTA acquisition, or extinction of CTA, were observed among the experimental
      groups (control, n = 7; CVS, n = 12; PNS+CVS, n = 9). In Experiment 2, we
      evaluated if early-life FLX exposure alters CTA learning in adulthood.
      Specifically, adolescent stress naive male and female rats received FLX (0 or 20 
      mg/kg/i.p) once daily for 15 consecutive days (PND35-49). During antidepressant
      exposure, FLX decreased body weight gain in both male (n = 7) and female rats (n 
      = 7), when compared to respective controls (male control, n = 8; female control, 
      n = 8). However, juvenile FLX exposure decreased body weight-gain in adult male, 
      but not female, rats. Lastly, adolescent FLX history had no effect on CTA
      acquisition or extinction in adulthood (PND70), in neither male nor female rats. 
      Together, the data indicate that juvenile FLX exposure results in a long-term
      decrease of body weight-gain in a male-specific manner. Yet, independent of sex, 
      neither early-life stress nor FLX exposure alters CTA learning in adulthood.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The exact incidence and outcomes of acute occlusive arterial
      mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) are unclear as most studies include only patients
      diagnosed correctly while alive. The aim of this study was to assess the
      incidence, mortality, and diagnostics of AMI by also including patients diagnosed
      post-mortem. METHODS: This retrospective study comprised patients diagnosed with 
      AMI either alive or post-mortem between 2006-2015 within a health care district
      serving 1.6 million inhabitants. Key exclusion criteria were venous or
      non-obstructive ischaemia. RESULTS: A total of 470 patients were included in the 
      study of which 137 (29%) were diagnosed post-mortem. Most common misdiagnoses on 
      those not diagnosed alive were unspecified infection (n=19, 17%),
      gastrointestinal bleeding (n=13, 11%), and ileus (n=13, 11%). Of those diagnosed 
      alive (n=333), 187 (56%) underwent active surgical or endovascular treatment.
      During the 2006-2015 period, the overall incidence rate of AMI was 3.05 (95% CI
      2.78-3.34)/100 000 person-years and 26.66 (95% CI 24.07-29.45) for those aged
      70-years or more, respectively. The mean autopsy rate during the study period was
      29% for the overall population (32% during 2006-2010 and 25% during 2011-2015)
      and 18% for those aged 70-years or more. Overall, 90-day mortality was 83% in all
      patients. 90-day mortality decreased, being 87% during the first period
      (2006-2010) and 79% during the second period (2011-2015) (p = .029), while at the
      same time proportion of patients diagnosed alive rose from 71% to 80% (p = .030) 
      and number of endovascular revascularisations rose from 1% to 5% (p = 0.022).
      CONCLUSIONS: Significant proportion of patients with AMI are not diagnosed alive,
      which is reflected in the mortality rates. Post-mortem examinations and autopsy
      rate data continue to be key factors in epidemiological studies on AMI.

AB  - We present here a bi-modal CNN based deep-learning system, DeepPlnc, to identify 
      plant lncRNAs with high accuracy while using sequence and structural properties. 
      Unlike most of the existing software, it works accurately even in conditions with
      ambiguity of boundaries and incomplete sequences. It scored consistently high for
      performance metrics while breaching accuracy of >98% when tested across a large
      number of validated instances. During multiple benchmarkings it consistently
      outperformed all the compared tools and maintained a highly significant lead in
      the range of 2.5%- 4.6% from the second best performing tool (p-value << 0.01).
      DeepPlnc was used to annotate a de novo assembled transcriptome of a himalayan
      species where again it suggested its much better suitability for genome and
      transcriptome annotation purposes than the existing tools. DeepPlnc has been made
      freely available as a web-server and stand-alone program at
      https://scbb.ihbt.res.in/DeepPlnc/.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Many families seek medical care at pediatric urgent care centers. The
      objective of this study was to determine social and unintentional injury risks
      reported by these families. METHODS: This cross-sectional study surveyed a
      convenience sample of guardians of patients 1-5 years of age presenting to our
      pediatric urgent care, 9/10/21-2/25/22. Outcomes were the number of reported
      social and unintentional injury risks. Predictors and covariates included child
      and parent demographic characteristics and a neighborhood socioeconomic
      deprivation index. Chi square, student's t-test, Pearson's Correlation tests, and
      multinominal regression, were used. RESULTS: A total of 273 guardians (and
      children) were included; 245 of guardians (89.7%) were female; 137 (50.2%) of
      included children identified as Black. Approximately 60% reported >/=1 social
      risk; 31.5% reported >/=3. Approximately 90% reported >/=1 unintentional injury
      risk; 57.9% reported >/=3. There were significant associations between social
      risk presence and Black race, public/no insurance, and neighborhood deprivation
      (all p<0.05). There were no significant associations between unintentional injury
      risks and assessed predictors. Black guardians were more likely than those of
      other races to report a greater number of social risks (AOR 2.90, 95% CI 1.50,
      5.58 for >/=3 vs. 0 risk). Children with public/no insurance compared to private 
      insurance were more likely to experience a greater number of social risks (AOR
      3.34, 95% CI 1.42, 7.84 for >/=3 vs. 0 risks). CONCLUSIONS: Many presenting to
      pediatric urgent cares experience social and unintentional injury risks. Risk
      identification may guide equitable responses.

TI  - Rates and Outcomes of Periprosthetic Joint Infection in Persons who Inject Drugs.
LID - S0883-5403(22)00734-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.arth.2022.07.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is higher in persons
      who inject drugs (PWID) after total joint arthroplasty (TJA), though reported
      rates vary widely. This study was designed to assess outcomes of TJA in PWID and 
      to describe factors associated with improved PJI outcomes among PWID. METHODS: A 
      retrospective matched cohort study was performed using a 1:4 match among those
      with and those without a history of injection drug use (IDU) undergoing TJA.
      Demographic, surgical, and outcome variables were compared in multivariate
      logistic regressions to determine PJI predictors. Kaplan-Meier analyses were
      constructed to characterize the difference in survival of patients who did not
      have PJI or undergo joint explantation between PWID and the matching cohort.
      RESULTS: PWID had a 9-fold increased risk of PJI compared to the matched cohort
      (OR 9.605, 95% CI 2.781-33.175, p<0.001). Ten of 17 PWID who used injection drugs
      within 6 months of primary TJA (active use) had a PJI, while 7 of 41 PWID who did
      not have active use developed a PJI. Of PWID with PJI, treatment failure was seen
      in 15 of 17, while in patients who did not have an IDU history, 5 of 8 with PJI
      had treatment failure. CONCLUSION: Injection drug use is a significant risk
      factor for PJI following TJA. Future work investigating the effect of a
      multidisciplinary support team to assist in cessation of injection drug use and
      to provide social support may improve outcomes and reduce morbidity in this
      vulnerable population.

AB  - mPGES-1 is found to be up-regulated in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia
      nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of postmortem brain tissue from Parkinson's disease
      (PD) patients and neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD mice. Since
      the genetic deletion of mPGES-1 abolished 6-OHDA-induced PGE2 production and
      6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo models,
      mPGES-1 enzyme has the potential to be an important target for PD therapy. In the
      present work, we investigated whether a small organic molecule as mPGES-1
      inhibitor could exhibit the neuroprotective effects against 6-OHDA-induced
      neurotoxicity in in vitro and in vivo models. For this research goal, a new
      series of arylsulfonyl hydrazide derivatives was prepared and investigated
      whether these compounds may protect neurons against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity 
      in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Among them, compound 7s (MPO-0144) as a
      mPGES-1 inhibitor (PGE2 IC50 = 41.77 nM; mPGES-1 IC50 = 1.16 nM) exhibited a
      potent neuroprotection (ED50 = 3.0 nM) against 6-OHDA-induced in PC12 cells
      without its own neurotoxicity (IC50 = >10 muM). In a 6-OHDA-induced mouse model
      of PD, administration of compound 7s (1 mg/kg/day, for 7days, i.p.) ameliorated
      motor impairments and dopaminergic neuronal damage. These significant biological 
      effects of compound 7s provided the first pharmacological evidence that mPGES-1
      inhibitor could be a promising therapeutic agent for PD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare peri- and postoperative outcomes following artificial
      urinary sphincter (AUS) insertion using an abdominal versus a sub-inguinal
      counterincision for pressure regulating balloon (PRB) placement. METHODS: This
      was a retrospective review of all AUS placements by a single surgeon from
      2010-2020. Demographic, clinical, and surgical details were obtained from chart
      review. The cohorts were divided by PRB placement technique (sub-inguinal,
      abdominal, and attempted sub-inguinal converted intra-operatively to abdominal
      ["conversion group"]). RESULTS: There were 182 AUS devices placed. The
      sub-inguinal approach was successfully completed in 132/144 (92%) and converted
      to high abdominal PRB placement in 12/144 (8.3%). The risk of conversion was not 
      increased by prior laparoscopically-assisted robotic prostatectomy (LRP) or
      radiotherapy (RT). Median operative time was 62, 75, and 77 minutes for
      sub-inguinal, abdominal, and conversion groups, respectively (p=0.30). Time to
      device activation was 25.0, 32.0, and 37.5 days for abdominal, sub-inguinal, and 
      conversion groups, respectively (p<0.01). There were no bowel or bladder injuries
      and no PRB herniation in any group; however, there were five instances of pump
      migration superiorly, all in the sub-inguinal or conversion groups (p=0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: The sub-inguinal approach to PRB placement during AUS is safe and
      can be successfully completed over 90% of the time. However, it is not faster
      than the abdominal approach to PRB placement and it is associated with an
      increased risk of pump migration, though the latter may be confounded by the
      sub-dartos pouch for pump placement that was used in all sub-inguinal cases.

TI  - Predictors and trends of opioid-sparing radical prostatectomy from a large
      national cohort.
LID - S0090-4295(22)00636-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.urology.2022.06.038 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of pain medications after radical prostatectomy
      using a large national database. METHODS: The Premier Hospital Database was
      queried to identify all robotic and laparoscopic radical prostatectomies from
      January 2015 - March 2020 with length of stay >/=1 day. "Opioid-sparing" was
      defined as absence of intravenous opioid use after post-operative day 0 and
      absence of oral opioid use throughout admission. Comparisons were made between
      opioid-sparing and non-opioid-sparing prostatectomy. Logistic multivariable
      regression was used to identify predictors of opioid-sparing prostatectomy.
      RESULTS: A total of 62,660 patients were included, of whom 14,806 (23.6%)
      underwent opioid-sparing prostatectomy. Opioid-sparing prostatectomy was
      associated with older age (65 vs. 63 years, p<0.01), white vs. black race (76.3% 
      vs. 73.4%, p<0.01), high-volume surgeons (75.2% vs. 70.0%, p<0.01), and use of
      intravenous ketorolac (62.2% vs. 48.0%, p<0.01), intravenous acetaminophen (32.5%
      vs. 30.1%, p<0.01), and liposomal bupivacaine (5.4% vs. 4.9%, p<0.01). On
      multivariable regression, ketorolac was the strongest predictor of opioid-sparing
      prostatectomy (odds ratio: 1.86, 95% confidence interval: 1.79 - 1.93, p<0.01),
      and black race was predictive of non-opioid sparing prostatectomy (odds ratio:
      0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.71 - 0.80, P<0.01). Ketorolac was not associated
      with increased risk of postoperative bleeding (0.3% vs. 0.3%, p=1.0) or dialysis 
      requirement (<0.1% vs. <0.1%, p=0.91). CONCLUSION: Opioid-sparing radical
      prostatectomy was feasible and associated with administration of each of the
      non-opioid pain medications assessed. Ketorolac was the strongest predictor of
      opioid-sparing prostatectomy and was not associated with increased risk of
      bleeding or dialysis.

AB  - Morphological similarities and fastidious development of increasingly emerging
      fungal needle pathogens impede accurate disease diagnosis and early detection.
      This study analyzed the specificity and sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR)-based markers developed for emerging needle cast pathogens Lophodermella
      concolor and L. montivaga co-occurring on Pinus contorta var. latifolia, and
      Bifusella linearis and L. arcuata on P. flexilis. To design primers, we utilized 
      sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and single-copy gene
      (RH_2175) of the TCP-1/cpn60 chaperonin family searched through genomes of
      related species. In addition to the DNA of target and non-target fungal species
      that were used for primer assays, environmental samples with next generation
      sequencing data were used to evaluate primer sensitivity. Direct amplification
      using ITS primer pairs generated 248-260bp amplicons and successfully
      differentiated the needle pathogens used in this study. Nested amplification of
      single-copy gene RH_2175 primer pairs which produced 409-527bp amplicons detected
      Rhytismataceae species and discriminated both Lophodermella pathogens on P.
      contorta var. latifolia, respectively. While ITS-based primers had higher
      sensitivity than the 2175-based primers, both primer sets for L. concolor and L. 
      montivaga detected their respective pathogens in asymptomatic and symptomatic
      needles. These molecular tools can help monitor and assess needle diseases for
      forest management and phytosanitary regimes.

TI  - Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians: 
      a systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - S0161-6420(22)00566-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ophtha.2022.07.024 [doi]
AB  - TOPIC: This systematic review and meta-analysis summarises evidence relating to
      the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) among Indigenous and non-Indigenous
      Australians. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Indigenous Australians suffer disproportionately
      from diabetes-related complications. Exploring ethnic variation in disease is
      important for equitable distribution of resources and may lead to identification 
      of ethnic-specific modifiable risk factors. Existing DR prevalence studies
      comparing Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians have shown conflicting
      results. METHODS: This study was conducted following Joanna Briggs Institute
      guidance on systematic reviews of prevalence studies (PROSPERO ID:
      CRD42022259048). We performed searches of Medline (Ovid), EMBASE, and Web of
      Science until October 2021, using a strategy designed by an information
      specialist. We included studies reporting DR prevalence among diabetic patients
      in Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian populations. Two independent
      reviewers performed quality assessments using a 9-item appraisal tool.
      Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed using double arcsine
      transformation and a random-effects model comparing Indigenous and non-Indigenous
      subgroups. RESULTS: Fifteen studies with 8219 participants met criteria for
      inclusion. The Indigenous subgroup scored lower on the appraisal tool compared to
      the non-Indigenous subgroup (mean score 50% vs 72%, p=0.04). In the unadjusted
      meta-analysis, DR prevalence in the Indigenous subgroup (30.2% [95%CI:
      24.9-25.7]) did not differ significantly (p=0.17) from the non-Indigenous
      subgroup (23.7% (95%CI: 16.8-31.4]). After adjusting for age and for quality, DR 
      prevalence was higher in the Indigenous subgroup (p-values<0.01), with prevalence
      ratio point estimates ranging between 1.72-2.58, depending on the meta-regression
      model. For the secondary outcomes, prevalence estimates were higher in the
      Indigenous subgroup for diabetic macular oedema (8.7% vs 2.7%, p=0.02) and
      vision-threatening DR (8.6% vs 3.0%, p=0.03), but not for proliferative DR (2.5% 
      vs 0.8%, p=0.07). CONCLUSION: Indigenous studies scored lower for methodological 
      quality, raising the possibility that systematic differences in research
      practices may be leading to underestimation of disease burden. After adjusting
      for age and for quality, we found a higher DR prevalence in the Indigenous
      subgroup. This contrasts with a previous review which reported the opposite
      finding of lower DR prevalence using unadjusted pooled estimates. Future
      epidemiological work exploring DR burden in Indigenous communities should aim to 
      address methodological weaknesses identified by this review.

AB  - To improve the reliability of in vitro release studies of drug delivery systems, 
      we developed a novel in vitro method for the evaluation of drug release from
      polymeric micelles in complex biological media. Polymeric micelles based on
      poly(N-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylamide)-block-poly(N-2-benzoyloxypropyl
      methacrylamide) (p(HPMAm)-b-p(HPMAm-Bz)) of which 10% of the chains was
      functionalized with biotin at the p(HPMAm) terminus were prepared using a solvent
      extraction method. The size of the micelles when loaded with a hydrophobic agent,
      namely paclitaxel (a clinically used cytostatic drug) or curcumin (a compound
      with multiple pharmacological activities), was around 65nm. The biotin decoration
      allowed the binding of the micelles to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads which
      occurred within 10min and reached a binding efficiency of 90+/-6%. Drug release
      in different media was studied after the magnetic separation of micelles bound to
      the streptavidin-coated beads, by determination of the released drug in the media
      as well as the retained drug in the micellar fraction bound to the beads. The in 
      vitro release of paclitaxel and curcumin at 37 degrees C in PBS, PBS containing
      2% v/v Tween 80, PBS containing 4.5% w/v bovine serum albumin, mouse plasma, and 
      whole mouse blood was highly medium-dependent. In all media studied, paclitaxel
      showed superior micellar retention compared to curcumin. Importantly, the
      presence of serum proteins accelerated the release of both paclitaxel and
      curcumin. The results presented in this study show great potential for predicting
      drug release from nanomedicines in biological media which in turn is crucial for 
      their further pharmaceutical development.

TI  - How does protocolization improve outcomes in cardiogenic shock due to end-stage
      heart failure?

LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2022.07.045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protocolized team-based care has been shown to improve outcomes in
      cardiogenic shock (CS) in patients with end-stage heart failure (ESHF). This
      study tested the hypothesis that protocolized care improves survival by reducing 
      multi-organ dysfunction prior to orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) or
      durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). METHODS: We developed a
      protocolized Recognize/rescue-Optimization-Stabilization-Exit/de-Escalation
      (ROSE) framework for CS due to ESHF. Six-month survival pre-ROSE (2014-2018) and 
      post-ROSE (2018-2021) were compared. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
      (SOFA) score was calculated as a measure of multi-organ dysfunction pre-MCS and
      pre-"Exit" therapy (OHT, LVAD or recovery). RESULTS: 101 consecutive patients
      with CS due to ESHF who were deteriorating on inotropes (INTERMACS 1 or 2) were
      included (63 in Pre-ROSE and 38 in Post-ROSE). The proportions of patients who
      died on support (26 (41%) vs 11 (29%), p=0.213) or bridged to "Exit" therapy were
      comparable between Pre- and Post-ROSE: OHT (28 (44%) vs 21 (55%), p=0.292);
      durable LVAD (8 (13%) vs 5 (13%), p=0.947); or recovery (1 (2%) vs 1 (3%),
      p=0.715). SOFA score prior to "Exit" therapy was higher Pre-ROSE compared to
      Post-ROSE (4 (2-7) vs 2 (1-5), p=0.012). Six-month survival from initial MCS (71%
      vs 41%, p=0.004) and in patients who underwent "Exit" therapy (100% vs 71%,
      p=0.001) were higher Post-ROSE vs Pre-ROSE, respectively. Higher pre-"Exit" SOFA 
      score was associated with 6-month survival. None of the patients with Pre-"Exit" 
      SOFA score>/=9 survived at 6months. CONCLUSION: Protocolization of CS care in
      ESHF improved six-month survival by improving multi-organ dysfunction (SOFA
      score) prior to OHT and LVAD implant.

TI  - Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries in hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy vs Fabry disease.
LID - S0167-5273(22)01116-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2022.07.046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about prevalence and predictors of myocardial
      infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) in Fabry disease (FD) 
      and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We assessed and compared the prevalence
      and predictors of MINOCA in a large cohort of HCM and FD patients. METHODS: In
      this multicenter, retrospective study we enrolled 2870 adult patients with HCM
      and 267 with FD. The only exclusion criterion was documented obstructive coronary
      artery disease. MINOCA was defined according to guidelines. For each patient we
      collected clinical, ECG and echocardiographic data recorded at initial
      evaluation. RESULTS: Overall, 36 patients had MINOCA during a follow-up period of
      4.5+/-11.2years, MINOCA occurred in 16 patients with HCM (0.5%) and 20 patients
      with FD (7.5%; p<0.001). The difference between the 2 groups was highly
      significant, also after adjustment for the main clinical, ECG and
      echocardiographic variables (OR 6.12;95%CI:2.80-13.3;p<0.001). In the FD
      population MINOCA occurred in 17 out of 96 patients with left ventricle
      hypertrophy (LVH, 17.7%) and in 3 out of 171 patients without LVH (1.7%; OR
      12.0;95%CI 3.43-42.3;p<0.001). At multivariable analysis, voltage criteria for
      LVH at ECG (OR 7.3;95%CI 1.93-27.7;p=0.003) and maximal LV wall thickness at
      echocardiography (OR 1.15; 95%CI 1.05-1.27;p=0.002) maintained an independent
      association with MINOCA. No major significant differences were found in clinical,
      ECG and echocardiographic findings between HCM patients with or without MINOCA.
      CONCLUSIONS: MINOCA was rare in HCM patients, and 6-fold more frequent in FD
      patients. MINOCA may be considered a red flag for FD and aid in the differential 
      diagnosis from HCM.

TI  - Empagliflozin inhibits macrophage inflammation through AMPK signaling pathway and
      plays an anti-atherosclerosis role.
LID - S0167-5273(22)01119-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2022.07.048 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In recent years, some authoritative clinical studies have found that
      SGLT2 inhibitor can reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes, which
      may imply that SGLT2 inhibitor can play a role beyond lowering blood glucose. In 
      this study, we explored the effect of empagliflozin on vascular atherosclerosis
      after removing the effect of diabetes. METHODS: The interaction between SGLT2
      inhibitor and the AMPK(Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase)
      signal pathway to attenuate atherosclerosis was studied in both spontaneously
      atherosclerotic mice in vivo and oxidized low-density lipoprotein(ox-LDL) induced
      macrophage inflammation model in vitro. In vivo experiment the aorta tree and
      aortic valve area were stained with oil red, and the level of inflammatory
      factors in the diseased tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Meanwhile, 
      serum was collected to detect the levels of inflammatory factors. In vitro
      experiment, the RAW264.7 cell line was selected and ox-LDL was used to induce the
      release of proinflammatory factors, and different doses of empagliflozin were
      added. The phagocytosis of macrophages to ox-LDL density lipoprotein, and the
      expression of inflammatory factors at the protein and RNA levels were measured.
      RESULTS: Empagliflozin reduced the area of atherosclerotic plaque and macrophage 
      infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques, decreased the expression of inflammatory
      factors in local plaque tissues and serum of APOE(-/-) mice fed with high-fat
      diet. Empagliflozin can improve the protein expression level of p-AMPK affected
      by ox-LDL in cell and reduce the gene expression level of inflammatory factors
      and protein expression level of NF-kappaB, thus playing an anti-atherosclerosis
      role. CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin improves energy metabolism and reduces the
      expression of inflammatory factors by activating AMPK. As empagliflozin inhibits 
      atherosclerosis progression, it may be of use in prevention of cardiovascular
      diseases.

LID - 10.1016/j.ihj.2022.07.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients the focus is on major
      conventional risk factors - CRF [diabetes, hypertension, elevated low-density
      cholesterol (LDL-C) and smoking] whereas others - specific metabolic risk factors
      - MRF [high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), body-mass index (BMI),
      waist-hip ratio (WHR), and triglycerides, and HbA1c get less attention. METHODS: 
      This is a prospective case-control observational study from 15 tertiary care
      hospitals in India. CRF and MRF in patients presenting with first incidence of
      ACS (n=2153) were compared with matched controls (n=1210). RESULTS: Propensity
      score matching (PSM) yielded 1193 cases and matched 1210 controls. Risk factor
      prevalence in cases vs. controls were CRF: hypertension - 39.4% vs 16.4%
      (P<0.0001), diabetes - 42.6% vs 12.7% (P<0.0001), smoking - 28.3% vs 9.3%
      (P<0.0001) and elevated LDL-C - 70.2% vs 57.9% (P<0.0001). MRF: BMI - 54.7%
      vs55.1% (P=0.84), waist: hip ratio 79.5% vs 63.6% (P<0.0001), high HbA1C - 37.8% 
      vs 14.9% (P<0.0001), low HDL-C - 56.2% vs 42.8% (P<0.0001) and elevated
      triglycerides - 49.7% vs 44.2%. (P=0.007). Adjusted Odds ratios by multivariate
      analysis were CRF: hypertension - 2.3 (P<0.001), diabetes - 4.7 (P<0.001), high
      LDL-C - 3.3 (P<0.001) and smoking- 6.3 (P<0.001). MRF: waist: hip ratio - 2.4
      (P<0.001) high HbA1c - 3.2 (P<0.001), low HDL-C 2.2 (P<0.001) and elevated
      triglycerides - 0.878 P=0.17. CONCLUSION: In India, the risk of ACS conferred by 
      specific metabolic risk factors (High waist: hip ratio, Low HDL-C and High HbA1c)
      is comparable to that caused by CRF.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate, through in vivo and in vitro methodologies, the 
      effect of acute trans,trans-farnesol (12.5, 25, 50 or 100mg/kg, p.o.)
      administration on behavioral and neurochemical parameters associated with
      pilocarpine-induced epileptic seizure (300mg/kg, i.p.) in mice. The initial
      results showed that the compound in question presents no anxiolytic-like or
      myorelaxant effects, despite reducing locomotor activity in the animals at all
      doses tested. In addition, the lowest dose increased the latency to onset of the 
      first epileptic seizure, and the time to death. In addition to decreasing the
      mortality percentage in mice submitted to the pilocarpine model. In this same
      model, pretreatment with the lowest dose of the compound decreased the
      hippocampal concentrations of thiobarbituric acid and nitrite, and partially
      restored striatal concentrations of noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin. Taken
      together, the results suggest that trans,trans-farnesol presents a central
      depressant effect which contributes to its antiepileptic action which, in turn,
      seems to be mediated by the antagonism of muscarinic cholinergic receptors,
      reduction of oxidative stress. and modulation of noradrenaline, dopamine and
      serotonin concentrations in the central nervous system.

AB  - AIMS: Colon cancer (CC) is a prevalent malignancy worldwide and is one of the
      most easily altered cancers by dietary regulation. Petunidin
      3-O-[rhamnopyranosyl-(trans-p-coumaroyl)]-5-O-(beta-D-glucopyranoside) (Pt3R5G)
      isolated and purified from Lycium ruthenicum Murray, which exhibits highly
      efficient antioxidant activity and specific anticancer effects, is the flavonoids
      compound. We aimed to study the effect of Pt3R5G on CC cells and elucidate the
      potential underlying mechanisms. MAIN METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured by
      the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and
      colony formation assays. Cell cycle, cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) analysis were performed by flow cytometry. RNA-sequencing was performed to 
      elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms. The lipid peroxidation level of
      cells was detected by malondialdehyde (MDA) assay. The mitochondrial morphology
      of cells was inspected using a transmission electron microscope. Additionally, we
      overexpressed SLC7A11 to perform rescue experiments. In vivo, xenograft mice
      assay was performed to verify the effect of Pt3R5G on the growth of colon cancer.
      KEY FINDINGS: Pt3R5G reduced the cell activity by blocking the cell cycle in
      G0/G1 phase, inducing the apoptosis and ferroptosis in RKO cells. The
      overexpressed of SLC7A11, a significantly down-regulated expression gene caused
      by Pt3R5G, rescued the cell proliferation inhibition and ferroptosis process.
      Furthermore, Pt3R5G inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. Our study suggests that 
      Pt3R5G inhibits RKO cell proliferation through mainly reducing ferroptosis by
      down-regulated SLC7A11. SIGNIFICANCE: As a potential therapeutic drug, Pt3R5G
      showed efficient anticancer activity through a variety of pathways.

AB  - Understanding the cortical activation and postural control behavior during
      dual-task (DT) has been an object of study. However, despite the multiple
      benefits of exercise and good sleep quality, less is known about the correlation 
      between physical activity (PA) and sleep quality (SQ) on postural control and
      brain activation under dual-task performance. This study aimed to analyze the
      correlation between PA level and SQ with postural control performance and
      hemodynamic response in the prefrontal cortex during the DT performance in young 
      adults. Thirty-four healthy young adults (mean age +/- SD=22.91 +/- 3.90 years)
      participated in this study, and they performed a single-task and cognitive and
      motor DT using their smartphones. Postural control was assessed using a force
      plate to record the center of pressure (CoP) data (total excursion of CoP (TOTEX 
      CoP), displacements of the CoP in anterior-posterior (CoP-AP) and medial-lateral 
      (CoP-ML) directions, mean total velocity displacement of CoP (MVELO CoP), mean
      displacement velocity of CoP in anterior-posterior (MVELO CoP-AP) and
      medial-lateral (MVELO CoP-ML) directions, amplitude of CoP in anterior-posterior 
      (A-AP) and medial-lateral (A-ML) directions, and 95% confidence ellipse sway area
      (CEA)). The hemodynamic response was measured by the oxyhemoglobin and
      deoxyhemoglobin concentrations using the functional near-infrared spectroscopy.
      The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index and International Physical Activity
      Questionnaire-Short Form questionnaires assessed SQ and level of PA,
      respectively. Results indicated a positive correlation between SQ and cognitive
      DT cost for CoP-ML (rs=0.422, p=0.013), MVELO CoP-ML (rs=0.422, p=0.013) and A-ML
      (rs=0.579, p < 0.001). There were no significant relations between the other
      outcomes (p > 0.05). In conclusion, poor sleep quality was associated with a
      worse postural control performance in CoP-ML, MVELO CoP-ML and A-ML parameters
      under cognitive dual-task conditions. The differences found in the postural
      control and hemodynamic response during dual-task performance do not correlate
      with physical activity level.

AB  - This study deals with the synthesis of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAPnps)
      mediated by Acacia falcata leaf extract. Aggregates of needle-shaped crystalline 
      nanostructures were confirmed by FE-SEM and TEM analysis. Well-defined rings in
      the SAED patterns corroborated the polycrystalline nature of the HAPnps.
      Individual elements present in the HAPnps were attested by the specific signals
      for Ca, P, and O in the EDS and XPS analyses. The distinct peaks observed in the 
      XRD spectrum matched well with the HAP hexagonal patterns with a mean crystallite
      size of 55.04nm. The FTIR study unveiled the coating of the nanoparticles with
      the biomolecules from Acacia falcata leaves. The suspension HAPnps exhibited
      polydispersity (0.446) and remarkable stability (zeta potential: - 31.9mV) as
      evident from DLS studies. The pore diameter was 25.7nm as obtained from BET
      analysis, suggesting their mesoporous nature. The HAPnps showed the cytotoxic
      effect on A549 lung and MDA-MB231 breast carcinoma cell lines, with an IC50 value
      of 55mug/mL. The distortion of the cell membrane and cell morphology, along with 
      the chromatin condensation and cell necrosis on treatment with HAPnps were
      detected under fluorescence microscopy post acridine orange/ethidium bromide dye 
      staining. This study reports the anti-cancerous potential of non-drug-loaded
      plant-mediated HAPnps. Therefore, the HAPnps obtained in this investigation could
      play a vital role in the biomedical field of cancer therapy.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis is a disease with a worldwide prevalence that is caused by
      Toxoplasma gondii. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are two pharmacological agents 
      commonly used to treat of this infection. However, they are accompanied by some
      side effects. Therefore, the identifying of new drugs with low toxocytosis seems 
      to be a matter of vital importance. Quinolones are DNA replication inhibitors,
      exerting inhibitory effects against many pathogens, including bacteria,
      mycoplasma, and protozoa. Given the importance of quinolones and their efficacy, 
      the present in vitro study was conducted to investigate the antiparasitic
      activities of new quinolones (NFQ-2, NFQ-5, and NFQ-6) containing nitrofuran
      moiety against T. gondii. To this end, Vero cells were incubated with various
      concentrations of new quinolones and pyrimethamine (positive control) to
      determine their viability. Subsequently, they were infected with T. gondii (RH
      strain) and then subjected to drug treatment. The obtained IC50 values were 3.60,
      4.84, 5.59, 3.44 and 2.75mug/mL for NFQ-2, NFQ-5, NFQ-6, ciprofloxacin and
      pyrimethamine, respectively. The CC50 values for the NFQ-2, NFQ-5, and NFQ-6 were
      25.20, 29.89, and 28.43mug/mL, indicating the selectivity indexes more than 5 for
      these compounds. The anti-Toxoplasma efficiency was determined by evaluating
      infection index, number and size of plaques, and T. gondii intracellular
      proliferation. As the results indicated, the administration of new quinolone
      derivatives resulted in the reduction of intracellular proliferation, infection
      index, and the number and size of plaques in comparison to uninfected treated
      cells (P<0.05). The results were indicative of a considerable synergetic effect
      when each of the derivatives was used in combination with pyrimethamine, compared
      to when used alone. Based on our results, the nitrofuran-derived quinolones can
      be considered as new leads for the design of new anti-Toxoplasma agents.

TI  - Timing of Colonoscopy in Acute Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding: A Multicenter
      Retrospective Cohort Study.
LID - S0016-5107(22)01863-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.gie.2022.07.025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to determine the optimal timing of colonoscopy and 
      factors that benefit patients who undergo early colonoscopy for acute lower
      gastrointestinal bleeding. METHODS: We identified 10,342 patients with acute
      hematochezia (CODE BLUE-J study) admitted to 49 hospitals in Japan. Of these,
      6,270 patients who underwent a colonoscopy within 120 h were included in this
      study. Inverse probability of treatment weighting method was used to adjust for
      baseline characteristics among early (</=24 h; n=4,133), elective (24-48 h;
      n=1,137), and late (48-120 h; n=1,000) colonoscopy. The average treatment effect 
      was evaluated for outcomes. The primary outcome was 30-day rebleeding. RESULTS:
      The early group had a significantly higher rate of stigmata of recent hemorrhage 
      (SRH) identification and a shorter length of stay (LOS) than the elective and
      late groups. However, the 30-day rebleeding rate was significantly higher in the 
      early group than in the elective and late groups. Interventional radiology
      (IVR)/surgery requirement and 30-day mortality did not significantly differ among
      the groups. The interaction with heterogeneity of effects was observed between
      early/late colonoscopy and shock index (shock index <1: OR, 2.097; shock index
      >/=1: OR, 1.095; P for interaction=0.038) and performance status (PS) (PS 0-2:
      OR, 2.481; PS >/=3: OR, 0.458; P for interaction=0.022) for 30-day rebleeding.
      Early colonoscopy had a significantly lower IVR/surgery requirement in the shock 
      index >/=1 cohort (OR, 0.267; 95% CI, 0.099-0.721) compared with late
      colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Early colonoscopy increased the rate of SRH
      identification and shortened LOS, but involved an increased risk of rebleeding
      and did not improve mortality and IVR/surgery requirement. Early colonoscopy
      benefited particularly patients with shock index >/=1 or performance status >/=3 
      at presentation.

LID - 10.1016/j.jacr.2022.06.004 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Radiologist medical school pathways have received little attention in
      recent workforce investigations. With osteopathic enrollment increasing, we
      assessed the osteopathic versus allopathic composition of the radiologist
      workforce. METHODS: Linking separate Medicare Doctors and Clinicians Initiative
      databases and Physician and Other Supplier Files from 2014 through 2019, we
      assessed (descriptively and using multivariate panel logistic regression
      modeling) individual and practice characteristics of radiologists who
      self-reported medical degrees. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2019, as the number of
      osteopathic radiologists increased 46.0% (4.7% to 6.0% of total radiologist
      workforce), the number of allopathic radiologists increased 12.1% (representing a
      relative workforce decrease from 95.3% to 94.0%). For each year since completing 
      training, practicing radiologists were 3.7% less likely to have osteopathic
      (versus allopathic) degrees (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96 per year, P < .01).
      Osteopathic radiologists were less likely to work in urban (versus rural) areas
      (OR = 0.95), and compared with the Midwest, less likely to work in the Northeast 
      (OR = 0.96), South (OR = 0.95), and West (OR = 0.94) (all P < .01). Except for
      cardiothoracic imaging (OR = 0.78, P = .24), osteopathic radiologists were more
      likely than allopathic radiologists to practice as general (rather than
      subspecialty) radiologists (range OR = 0.37 for nuclear medicine to OR = 0.65 for
      neuroradiology, all P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Osteopathic physicians represent a
      fast-growing earlier-career component of the radiologist workforce. Compared with
      allopathic radiologists, they more frequently practice as generalist
      radiologists, in rural areas, and in the Midwest. Given recent calls for greater 
      general and rural radiology coverage, increasing osteopathic representation in
      the national radiologist workforce could improve patient access.

TI  - Effect of Pentaerythrityltetranitrate (PETN) on the development of fetal growth
      restriction in pregnancies with impaired uteroplacental perfusion at mid
      gestation - a randomised trial.
LID - S0002-9378(22)00583-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ajog.2022.07.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction is strongly associated with impaired
      placentation and abnormal utero-placental blood flow. NO-donors like PETN are
      strong vasodilators and protect the endothelium. Recently, we demonstrated in a
      randomized controlled pilot-study a 38% relative risk reduction for the
      development of fetal growth restriction or perinatal death, following
      administration of PETN to pregnant women at risk, identified by impaired uterine 
      perfusion at mid gestation. Results of this mono-center study retrieved the
      hypothesis that PETN might have an effect in pregnancies with compromised
      placental function the sense of secondary prophylaxis. OBJECTIVE: To test the
      hypothesis that the NO-donor PETN reduces fetal growth restriction and perinatal 
      death in pregnant women with impaired placental perfusion at mid gestation in a
      multicenter trial. STUDY DESIGN: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo controlled trial with two parallel groups pregnant women presenting with 
      a mean uterine artery Pulsatility Index >95th percentile at 19+0 to 22+6 weeks of
      gestation were randomized to Pentalong(R) 50mg or placebo twice daily.
      Participants were assigned to high or low risk according to their medical history
      before randomization was performed block-wise with a fixed block length
      stratified by center and risk group. The primary efficacy endpoint was the
      composite outcome of perinatal death or development of fetal growth restriction. 
      Secondary endpoints were neonatal and maternal outcome parameters. RESULTS:
      Between August 2017 and March 2020 317 participants were included in the study
      and 307 were analyzed. The cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was 41.1% 
      in the PETN group and 45.5% in the placebo group, (unadjusted RR 0.90, 95%CI
      0.69-1.17; adjusted RR 0.90, 95%CI 0.69-1.17; p=0.43). Secondary outcomes like
      preterm birth (unadjusted RR 0.73, 95%CI 0.56-0.94; adjusted RR 0.73, 95%CI
      0.56-0.94; p=0.01) and pregnancy induced hypertension (unadjusted RR 0.65, 95%CI 
      0.46-0.93; adjusted RR 0.65, 95%CI 0.46-0.92; p=0.01) were reduced. CONCLUSION:
      Our study failed to show an impact of PETN on the development of fetal growth
      restriction and perinatal death in pregnant women with impaired uterine perfusion
      at mid gestation. PETN significantly reduced secondary outcome parameters like

TI  - Characteristics Associated with Composite Surgical Failure Over 5 Years of Women 
      in a Randomized Trial of Sacrospinous Hysteropexy With Graft versus Vaginal
      Hysterectomy With Uterosacral Ligament Suspension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Among women with symptomatic uterovaginal prolapse undergoing vaginal
      surgery in the Vaginal hysterectomy with Native Tissue Vault Suspension vs
      Sacrospinous Hysteropexy with Graft Suspension (Study for Uterine Prolapse
      Procedures-Randomized Trial (SUPeR) trial, sacrospinous hysteropexy with graft
      (hysteropexy) resulted in a lower composite surgical failure rate compared to
      vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral suspension (USLS) through 5 years.
      OBJECTIVES: To identify factors associated with rate of surgical failure over 5
      years among women undergoing sacrospinous hysteropexy with graft versus vaginal
      hysterectomy with USLS for uterovaginal prolapse. STUDY DESIGN: This planned
      secondary analysis of a comparative effectiveness trial of two transvaginal
      apical suspensions (NCT01802281) defined surgical failure as either re-treatment 
      of prolapse, recurrence of prolapse beyond the hymen, or bothersome prolapse
      symptoms. Baseline clinical and sociodemographic factors for eligible
      participants receiving the randomized surgery (N=173) were compared across
      categories of failure (</= 1 year, >1 year, no failure) with rank-based tests.
      Factors with adequate prevalence and clinical relevance were assessed for
      minimally adjusted bivariate associations using piecewise exponential survival
      models adjusting for randomized apical repair and clinical site. The
      multivariable model included factors with bivariate p<0.2, additional clinically 
      important variables, apical repair and clinical site. Backward selection
      determined final retained risk factors (p<0.1) with statistical significance
      evaluated by Bonferroni correction (p<0.005). Final factors were assessed for
      interaction with type of apical repair at p<0.1. Association is presented by
      adjusted hazard ratios and further illustrated by categorization of risk factors.
      RESULTS: In the final multivariable model, body mass index (BMI) (increase of 5
      kg/m(2): adjusted hazard ration (aHR) 1.7, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.3,
      2.2, p<0.001) and duration of prolapse symptoms, (increase of 1 year: aHR 1.1,
      95% CI 1.0, 1.1, p<0.005) were associated with composite surgical failure, where 
      rate of failure was 2.9 and 1.8 times higher in obese and overweight than
      normal/underweight women (95% CI 1.5, 5.8 and 0.9, 3.5) and 3.0 times higher in
      women experiencing >5 years prolapse symptoms compared to </=5 years (95% CI 1.8,
      5.0). Sacrospinous hysteropexy with graft had a lower rate of failure than
      hysterectomy with USLS (aHR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4, 1.0, p=0.05). Interaction between
      symptom duration and apical repair (p=0.07) indicated failure was less likely
      after hysteropexy compared to hysterectomy for those with </=5 years symptom
      duration, (aHR 0.5 (95% CI 0.2, 0.9) but not for those with >5 years symptoms
      (aHR1.0, 95% 0.5, 2.1). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors associated with surgical
      failure over 5 years from transvaginal prolapse repair, regardless of approach,
      include obesity and duration of prolapse symptoms. Providers and patients should 
      consider these modifiable risk factors when discussing treatment plans for
      bothersome prolapse.

TI  - Assessment of microvascular function using a novel technique Flow Mediated Skin
      Fluorescence (FMSF) in patients with diabetic kidney disease: A preliminary
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) plays an important role in morbidity
      and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of this
      microangiopathy is mainly due to impaired vascular endothelial function. The Flow
      Mediated Skin Fluorescence (FMSF) method is an innovative, non-invasive tool for 
      assessing the microcirculation function (especially microcirculatory response to 
      hypoxia), also in patients with complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: The study was conducted at the Medical University of Lodz, Poland.
      Total of 84 volunteers including 30 patients with DKD, 33 patients with DM
      without complications, and 21 healthy subjects underwent microvascular function
      assessments using FMSF. This technique measures changes in the intensity of
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence from the skin on the
      forearm as a function of time, in response to blocking and releasing blood flow
      in the forearm. In this study we asses two key parameters: Reactive Hyperemia
      Response (RHR) and Hypoxia Sensitivity [log(HS)] to characterize vascular
      circulation in patients with DKD and their response to transient ischemia.
      RESULTS: The patients with low reactive hyperemic response (the RHR parameter)
      had a significantly higher sCr than patients with moderate and high RHR value
      (p<0.001, p<0.05, respectively) and a significantly lower eGFR than the patients 
      with moderate and high RHR parameter (p<0.001, p<0.01, respectively). The
      patients with very low and low log(HS) values had a significantly higher sCr than
      the patients with high log(HS) (p<0.001, p<0.01, respectively), and a
      significantly lower eGFR than the patients with high log(HS) parameter (p<0.001, 
      p<0.01, respectively). The patients with very low log(HS) had a significantly
      higher sCr and a significantly lower eGFR than the patients with moderate
      (p<0.05, p<0.01, respectively). The mean value of the RHR parameter was
      significantly lower in DKD patients (18.31+/-5.06%) compared to both healthy
      subjects (34.37+/-8.18%, p<0.001) and DM without complications subgroup
      (28.75+/-7.12%, p<0.001). Similar trends were noted with the mean value of
      log(HS) parameter in DKD subgroup (1.03+/-0.5) vs. healthy subjects (1.59+/-0.53,
      p<0.001), and vs. DM without complications subgroup (1.73+/-0.52, p<0.001). We
      observed a significant inverse correlation between the RHR parameter and serum
      creatinine (sCr) and a significant positive correlations with eGFR (R=-0.3;
      p<0.05, R=0.61; p<0.001, respectively). We found also a significant negative
      correlations of the log(HS) measure with sCr and a significant positive
      correlations with eGFR (R=-0.33; p<0.01, R=0.55; p<0.001, respectively). We
      observed also a significant inverse correlation between the RHR and log(HS)
      parameters and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (R=-0.6; p<0.001, R=-0.32; 
      p<0.01, respectively). The AGEs parameter was also a significantly higher in
      patients with low RHR parameter than in patients with moderate (p<0.01) and high 
      (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The FMSF technique makes it possible to identify
      impairments of the microvascular function in patients with DKD. This study
      confirms that the simple two-parametric approach diagnostic tool perfectly
      characterizes the state of the microvascular system in diabetic patients with
      impaired renal function. These preliminary results require further validation in 
      a larger patients cohort.

      report.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an overlooked cause of morbidity, which was shown
      to accelerate inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal cell loss and is
      associated with spatial learning and memory impairments and some psychiatric
      disturbances in older adults. However, there is no effective treatment in order
      to offer a favorable outcome encompassing a good recovery after TBI in older
      adults. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the histological and
      neurobehavioral effects of Allopurinol (ALL) in older rats that received repeated
      TBI (rTBI). For this purpose, a weight-drop rTBI model was used on old male
      Wistar rats. Rats received 5 repeated TBI/sham injuries 24h apart and were
      treated with saline or Allopurinol 100mg/kg, i.p. each time. They were randomly
      assigned to three groups: control group (no injury); rTBI group (received 5 rTBI 
      and treated with saline); rTBI+ALL group (received 5 rTBI and treated with
      Allopurinol). Then, half of the animals from each group were sacrificed on day 6 
      and the remaining animals were assessed with Open field, Elevated plus maze and
      Morris Water Maze test. Basic neurological tasks were evaluated with neurological
      assessment protocol every other day until after the 19th day from the last
      injury. Brain sections were processed for neuronal cell count in the hippocampus 
      (CA1), dentate gyrus (DG), and prefrontal cortex (PC). Also, an
      immunohistochemical assay was performed to determine NeuN, iNOS, and TNFalpha
      levels in the brain regions. The number of neurons was markedly reduced in CA1,
      GD, and PC in rats receiving saline compared to those receiving allopurinol
      treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis showed marked induction of iNOS and
      TNFalpha expression in the brain tissues which were reduced after allopurinol at 
      6 and 19days post-injury. Also, ALL-treated rats demonstrated a remarkable induce
      in NeuN expression, indicating a reduction in rTBI-induced neuronal cell death.
      In neurobehavioral analyses, time spent in closed arms, in the corner of the open
      field, swimming latency, and distance were impaired in injured rats; however, all
      of them were significantly improved by allopurinol therapy. To sum up, this study
      demonstrated that ALL may mitigate rTBI-induced damage in aged rats, which
      suggests ALL as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of recurrent
      TBI.

AB  - 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmental
      contaminant that induces diverse biological and toxic effects, including
      reprogramming intermediate metabolism, mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 
      (AHR). However, the specific reprogramming effects of TCDD are unclear. Here, we 
      performed targeted LC-MS analysis of hepatic extracts from mice gavaged with
      TCDD. We detected an increase in S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine, a conjugate from 
      the spontaneous reaction between the cysteine sulfhydryl group and highly
      reactive acrylyl-CoA, an intermediate in the cobalamin (Cbl)-independent
      beta-oxidation-like metabolism of propionyl-CoA. TCDD repressed genes in both the
      canonical Cbl-dependent carboxylase and the alternate Cbl-independent
      beta-oxidation-like pathways as well as inhibited methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) 
      at lower doses. Moreover, TCDD decreased serum Cbl levels and hepatic cobalt
      levels while eliciting negligible effects on gene expression associated with Cbl 
      absorption, transport, trafficking, or derivatization to
      5'-deoxy-adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), the required MUT cofactor. Additionally,
      TCDD induced the gene encoding aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1), the enzyme
      responsible for decarboxylation of cis-aconitate to itaconate, and
      dose-dependently increased itaconate levels in hepatic extracts. Our results
      indicate MUT inhibition is consistent with itaconate activation to itaconyl-CoA, 
      a MUT suicide inactivator that forms an adduct with AdoCbl. This adduct in turn
      inhibits MUT activity and reduces Cbl levels. Collectively, these results suggest
      the decrease in MUT activity is due to Cbl depletion following TCDD treatment,
      which redirects propionyl-CoA metabolism to the alternate Cbl-independent
      beta-oxidation-like pathway. The resulting hepatic accumulation of acrylyl-CoA
      likely contributes to TCDD-elicited hepatotoxicity and the multi-hit progression 
      of steatosis to steatohepatitis with fibrosis.

AB  - Natural products constitute and significantly impact many current anti-cancer
      medical interventions. A subset of natural products induces injury processes in
      malignant cells that recruit and activate host immune cells to produce an
      adaptive anti-cancer immune response, a process known as immunogenic cell death. 
      However, a challenge in the field is to delineate forms of cell death and injury 
      that best promote durable antitumor immunity. Addressing this with a single-cell 
      chemical biology natural product discovery platform, like multiplex activity
      metabolomics, would be especially valuable in human leukemia, where cancer cells 
      are heterogeneous and may react differently to the same compounds. Herein, a new 
      ten-color, fluorescent cell barcoding-compatible module measuring six immunogenic
      cell injury signaling readouts: DNA damage response (gammaH2AX), apoptosis
      (cCAS3), necroptosis (p-MLKL), mitosis (p-Histone H3), autophagy (LC3), and the
      unfolded protein response (p-EIF2alpha). A proof-of-concept screen was performed 
      to validate functional changes in single cells induced by secondary metabolites
      with known mechanisms within bacterial extracts. This assay was then applied in
      multiplexed activity metabolomics to reveal an unexpected mammalian cell injury
      profile induced by the natural product narbomycin. Finally, the functional
      consequences of injury pathways on immunogenicity were compared with three
      canonical assays for immunogenic hallmarks, ATP, HMGB1, and calreticulin, to
      correlate secondary metabolite-induced cell injury profiles with canonical
      markers of immunogenic cell death. In total, this work demonstrated a new
      phenotypic screen for discovery of natural products that modulate injury response
      pathways that can contribute to cancer immunogenicity.

TI  - Importance of RNA length for in vitro encapsidation by the nucleoprotein of human
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome
      constitutively encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein N, forming a helical
      nucleocapsid which is the template for viral transcription and replication by the
      viral polymerase L. Recruitment of L onto the nucleocapsid depends on the viral
      phosphoprotein P, which is an essential L cofactor. A prerequisite for genome and
      antigenome encapsidation is the presence of the monomeric, RNA-free,
      neosynthesised N protein, named N(0). Stabilisation of N(0) depends on the
      binding of the N-terminal residues of P to its surface, which prevents N
      oligomerisation. However, the mechanism involved in the transition from N(0)-P to
      nucleocapsid assembly, and thus in the specificity of viral genome encapsidation,
      is still unknown. Furthermore, the specific role of N oligomerisation and RNA in 
      the morphogenesis of viral factories, where viral transcription and replication
      occur, have not been elucidated although the interaction between P and N
      complexed to RNA has been shown to be responsible for this process. Here, using a
      chimeric protein comprising N and the first 40 N-terminal residues of P, we
      succeeded in purifying a recombinant N(0)-like protein competent for RNA
      encapsidation in vitro. Our results showed the importance of RNA length for
      stable encapsidation and revealed that the nature of the 5' end of RNA does not
      explain the specificity of encapsidation. Finally, we showed that RNA
      encapsidation is crucial for the in vitro reconstitution of pseudo-viral
      factories. Together, our findings provide insight into RSV viral genome
      encapsidation specificity.

AB  - Nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) is the most serious form of spermatogenesis
      abnormalities in male infertility. Genetic factors are important to consider as
      elements leading to NOA. Although many pathogenic genes have been reported, the
      causative genes of NOA for many patients are still unknown. In this study, we
      found ten point mutations in the gene encoding homeodomain-interacting protein
      kinase 4 (HIPK4) in patients with NOA, and using in vitro studies we determined a
      premature termination point mutation (p. Lys490*, c.1468A>T) that can cause
      decreased expression of HIPK4. Our phosphoproteomic analysis of Hipk4(-/-) testes
      revealed phosphorylation of multiple proteins regulated by HIPK4 during
      spermiogenesis. We also confirmed that a substrate of HIPK4 with four
      down-regulated phosphorylation sites matching the xSPx motif is the known
      manchette-related protein RIMS-binding protein 3 (RIMBP3), which is required for 
      sperm head morphogenesis. Therefore, we conclude HIPK4 regulates the
      phosphorylation of manchette protein RIMBP3 and plays essential roles in sperm
      head shaping and male fertility.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2022.07.071 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gluten ingestion in celiac disease (CeD) patients can lead to 
      gastrointestinal symptoms and small intestinal mucosal injury METHODS: This
      gluten-challenge (GC) Phase 2 trial was double-blind, placebo-controlled, and
      assessed the efficacy and safety of a 1,200 mg dose of IMGX003 in CeD patients
      exposed to 2 g of gluten per day for 6 weeks. The change in the ratio of villus
      height to crypt depth (Vh:Cd) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints
      included densities of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and symptom severity.
      These endpoints were evaluated by ANCOVA. Additional endpoints included serology 
      and gluten-immunogenic peptides (GIP) in urine RESULTS: Fifty (50) patients were 
      randomized, and 43 patients completed (n=21 IMGX003, n=22 placebo). The mean
      DeltaVh:Cd (primary endpoint) for IMGX003 vs. placebo was -0.04 vs. -0.35 (p =
      .057). The mean DeltaIEL (secondary endpoint) for IMGX003 vs. placebo was 9.8 vs.
      24.8 (p = .018). The mean change (worsening) in symptom severity (secondary
      endpoint) for IMGX003 vs. placebo was 0.22 vs. 1.63 (abdominal pain, p = .231),
      0.96 vs. 3.29 (bloating, p = .204), and 0.02 vs. 3.20 (tiredness, p = .113). The 
      3 x 2-week trend-line significance for these symptoms, respectively, were p =
      .014, .030 and .002 CONCLUSION: IMGX003 reduced gluten-induced intestinal mucosal
      damage and symptom severity. CLINICALTRIALS: gov number NCT03585478.

TI  - The effects of inspiratory muscle training on inspiratory muscle strength, lung
      function and quality of life in adults with spinal cord injuries: a systematic
      review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2022.2107085 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the
      effectiveness of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on respiratory muscle
      strength, lung function and quality of life (QOL) in adults with spinal cord
      injuries (SCI). METHODS: Databases were searched up to June 2022; CENTRAL,
      CINAHL, MEDLINE, PEDRo, and PubMed. Following PRISMA reporting guidelines, two
      independent reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Study quality and
      levels of evidence were assessed. RESULTS: Following selection from 624 initial
      search results, six randomised controlled trials were identified, comprising 124 
      participants. Quality of Evidence was very low to moderate. Meta-analysis showed 
      that post intervention, IMT significantly improved maximal inspiratory pressure
      (MD 15.72 cmH2O, 95% CI 5.02, 26.41, p = 0.004) when compared with a control
      intervention. There was no significant benefit for physical QOL (SMD 0.12, 95% CI
      -1.01, 1.25, p = 0.84), mental QOL (SMD -0.2, 95% CI -1.72, 1.33, p = 0.80),
      maximal expiratory pressure (MD 5.19 cmH2O, 95% CI -4.16, 14.55, p = 0.80), or
      FEV1 (MD 0.26 L, 95% CI -0.19, 0.7, p = 0.26). Sensitivity analyses found larger 
      effects for studies with 8 week interventions (MD 17.5 cmH2O (95% CI 3.36 to
      31.66)) and spring loaded devices alone (MD 21.18 cmH2O, 95% CI 9.65 to 32.72).
      CONCLUSION: Moderate quality evidence suggests IMT improves respiratory strength 
      in adults with an SCI. The mental and physical QOL outcomes provided very low
      quality of evidence, with considerable heterogeneity between study results,
      leading to inconsistency. Further research is warranted to investigate medium and
      long-term impact of robust IMT protocols, accounting for patient motivation and
      adherence to IMT.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONInspiratory muscle training (IMT)
      significantly improves respiratory muscle strength in adults with spinal cord
      injuries-irrespective of time since injury, or degree of injury completeness.IMT 
      is a feasible, safe, and worthwhile intervention to implement with adults with
      spinal cord injuries and can be utilized in a variety of settings.IMT
      interventions that are 8 weeks long and utilize a spring-loaded inspiratory
      threshold device may generate the largest improvements in respiratory strength.

TI  - Screening accuracy of the 50g-glucose challenge test in twin compared with
      singleton pregnancies.
LID - dgac472 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac472 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The optimal 50g-glucose challenge test (GCT) cut-off for the diagnosis
      of gestational diabetes (GDM) in twin pregnancies is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To
      explore the screening accuracy of the 50g-GCT and its correlation with the risk
      of large for gestational age (LGA) newborn in twin compared to singleton
      pregnancies. DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study (2007-2017).
      SETTING: Ontario, Canada. POPULATION: Patients with a singleton
      (n=546,892[98.4%]) or twin (n=8,832[1.6%]) birth who underwent screening for GDM 
      using the 50g-GCT. METHODS: We compared the screening accuracy, risk of GDM, and 
      risk of LGA between twin and singleton pregnancies using various 50g-GCT
      cut-offs. RESULTS: For any given 50g-GCT result, the probability of GDM was
      higher (p=0.0067) while the probability of LGA was considerably lower in the twin
      compared with the singleton group, even when a twin-specific growth chart was
      used to diagnose LGA in the twin group (p<0.001). The estimated false positive
      rate (FPR) for GDM was higher in twin compared with singleton pregnancies
      irrespective of the 50g-GCT cut-off used. The cut-off of 8.2 mmol/L (148 mg/dL)
      in twin pregnancies was associated with an estimated FPR (10.7-11.1%) that was
      similar to the FPR associated with the cut-off of 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) in
      singleton pregnancies (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The screening performance of the
      50g-GCT for GDM and its correlation with LGA differ between twin and singleton
      pregnancies.

TI  - Effect of microbial inoculation and storage length on the fermentation profile

      concentrations.
LID - skac254 [pii]

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of microbial
      inoculation and storage length on the fermentation profile and nutrient
      composition of high-moisture corn (HMC) ensiled at two different dry matter (DM) 
      concentrations. High-moisture corn was harvested when kernel DM concentrations
      were approaching 65% as-fed, and either left undried (HMC65; 67.6% DM) or dried
      at 40 degrees C to approximately 70% DM (HMC70; 71.0% DM), and then ensiled in
      quadruplicate vacuum pouches untreated (CON) or after one of the following
      inoculant treatments: 6.36 x 10 5 cfu of Lentilactobacillus buchneri DSM 12856,
      Lactiplantibacillus plantarum DSM 12836, and Pediococcus acidilactici DSM 16243
      per g of HMC (LBLP); or 3.0 x 10 5 cfu of L. buchneri DSM 12856,
      Lentilactobacillus diolivorans DSM 32074, and P. acidilactici DSM 16243 per g of 
      HMC (LBLD). Vacuum pouches were allowed to ferment for 7, 14, 28, or 56 d. A
      three-way interaction was observed (P = 0.01) for the pH of HMC, where CON for
      HMC70 was greatest across storage lengths and HMC65 treatments generally had a
      lower pH than other treatments. Concentrations of total acids were greater (P =
      0.001) in HMC65 than HMC70 and greater (P = 0.001) in HMC treated with LBLP and
      LBLD than CON. An interaction between DM concentration, microbial inoculation,
      and storage length was observed (P = 0.05) for concentrations of acetic acid. At 
      14 d, acetic acid concentrations were greater in HMC65 treated with LBLD than
      other treatments. Likewise, at 56 d, concentrations of acetic acid were greatest 
      in HMC65 treated with LBLD, followed by HMC70 treated with LBLD. An interaction
      between DM concentration, microbial inoculation, and storage length was observed 
      (P = 0.05) for 7-h starch disappearance (starchD). Across all DM concentration
      and inoculant treatment combinations, starchD increased with increasing storage
      length. StarchD was also generally greater for HMC65 treatments compared to
      HMC70, with small differences among inoculants. Results suggest that microbial
      inoculation can improve fermentation of HMC by increasing the production of
      antifungal acetic acid, but that DM concentration at ensiling remains a primary
      determinant of HMC fermentability.

TI  - Patient Engagement by the Tobacco Quitline After Electronic Referrals.
LID - ntac190 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntac190 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Referrals through the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system provide
      an efficient evidence-based method to connect patients to the Tobacco Quitline.
      However, patients frequently do not respond to Quitline phone calls or accept
      services. The goal of this study was to characterize factors associated with
      successful engagement with Quitline following e-referrals by physicians in
      Maryland. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study with hierarchical data
      modeling. Data for 1790 patients e-referred in 2018-2019 by the University of
      Maryland Medical System were analyzed. Patients' engagement was assessed using a 
      Generalized Estimating Equation multivariable regression model for ordinal
      outcomes at two levels: picking up a phone call from Quitline (1-800-QUIT-NOW)
      and enrollment in tobacco cessation programs. RESULTS: Older age, female gender, 
      Black race, low socioeconomic status, and provider's skills were significantly
      associated with successful outcomes of Quitline referral. The engagement with
      Quitline was higher in Black non-Hispanic patients compared to other
      racial/ethnic groups (phone call response OR=1.99, 95% CI 1.35, 2.93 and service 
      acceptance OR=1.89, 95% CI 1.28, 2.79). Patients residing in socioeconomically
      deprived areas were more likely to respond to Quitline phone call compared to
      those from affluent neighborhoods (OR=1.52, 95% CI 1.03, 2.25). Patients referred
      by faculty/attending physicians were more likely to respond compared to those
      referred by residents (OR=1.23, 95% CI 1.04, 1.44, p=0.0141). CONCLUSIONS:
      Multiple factors impact successful engagement with Quitline. Additional means to 
      improve Quitline engagement success may include focused messaging on tobacco
      cessation benefits to patients, and skillful counselling by the provider.
      IMPLICATIONS: Implementation of the Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tool for
      electronic referrals to the Tobacco Quitline at the University of Maryland
      Medical System was successful in providing evidence-based free service to elderly
      patients and socioeconomically disadvantaged racial/ethnic minorities. The CDS
      also served to engage physicians in conversation about tobacco use and cessation 
      with every tobacco using patient. Curricular content for physicians in training
      should be enriched to expand tobacco use and treatment.

TI  - Artificial intelligence-based diagnosis of abnormalities in small-bowel capsule
      endoscopy.
LID - 10.1055/a-1881-4209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND : Further development of deep learning-based artificial intelligence
      (AI) technology to automatically diagnose multiple abnormalities in small-bowel
      capsule endoscopy (SBCE) videos is necessary. We aimed to develop an AI model, to
      compare its diagnostic performance with doctors of different experience levels,
      and to further evaluate its auxiliary role for doctors in diagnosing multiple
      abnormalities in SBCE videos. METHODS : The AI model was trained using 280 426
      images from 2565 patients, and the diagnostic performance was validated in 240
      videos. RESULTS : The sensitivity of the AI model for red spots, inflammation,
      blood content, vascular lesions, protruding lesions, parasites, diverticulum, and
      normal variants was 97.8 %, 96.1 %, 96.1 %, 94.7 %, 95.6 %, 100 %, 100 %, and
      96.4 %, respectively. The specificity was 86.0 %, 75.3 %, 87.3 %, 77.8 %, 67.7 %,
      97.5 %, 91.2 %, and 81.3 %, respectively. The accuracy was 95.0 %, 88.8 %, 89.2
      %, 79.2 %, 80.8 %, 97.5 %, 91.3 %, and 93.3 %, respectively. For junior doctors, 
      the assistance of the AI model increased the overall accuracy from 85.5 % to 97.9
      % (P < 0.001, Bonferroni corrected), comparable to that of experts (96.6 %, P >
      0.0125, Bonferroni corrected). CONCLUSIONS : This well-trained AI diagnostic
      model automatically diagnosed multiple small-bowel abnormalities simultaneously
      based on video-level recognition, with potential as an excellent auxiliary system
      for less-experienced endoscopists.

AB  - AIM: to assess if the use of an audiovisual intervention in the uptake room
      and/or in the scanning room, could help to reduce anxiety during [18F]FDG PET/CT 
      imaging. METHODS: We prospectively studied 120 patients referred for [18F]FDG
      PET/CT imaging. Patients were allocated in 4 groups of 30 patients depending on
      the use of the audiovisual intervention: (1) no audiovisual intervention; (2)
      audiovisual intervention only in the uptake room; (3) audiovisual intervention
      only in the scanning room; (4) audiovisual intervention in the uptake and the
      scanning rooms. In order to measure the anxiety levels of the patients before and
      after the scan, all patients answered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).
      RESULTS: The anxiety status across typical situations on a daily basis (STAI-T)
      of the 4 groups of patients was comparable with no significant differences. The
      mean State Anxiety (STAI-S) sum-score at prescan and postscan among groups was:
      (1) 17.5+/-8.7 vs. 17.3+/-8.6, p=0.834; (2) 17.4+/-10.5 vs. 15.8+/-9.6, p=0.110; 
      (3) 17.5+/-11.7 vs. 15.1+/-9.8, p= 0.013; (4) 17.4+/-9.7 vs. 14.9+/-8.1, p=
      0.009. The percentage of patients with reduction of the STAI-S score among groups
      1-4 was 17%, 47%, 50%, and 66%, respectively. The variation of the percentage of 
      patients with lower scores after intervention among groups was statistically
      significant (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Audiovisual intervention decreases anxiety
      levels of patients referred for PET/CT imaging. The results of our study support 
      a beneficial effect of the audiovisual intervention and its potential to
      alleviate the anxiety of oncological patients who undergo a PET/CT scan.

AB  - Germline PTEN variants (PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome [PHTS]) confer up to 85%
      lifetime risk of female breast cancer (BC). BCs arising in PHTS are clinically
      distinct from sporadic BCs, including younger age of onset, multifocality, and an
      increased risk of second primary BCs. Yet, there is no previous investigation
      into the underlying genomic landscape of this entity. We sought to address the
      hypothesis that BCs arising in PHTS have a distinct genomic landscape compared to
      sporadic counterparts. We performed and analyzed exome sequencing data from 44
      women with germline PTEN variants who developed BCs. The control cohort comprised
      of 497 women with sporadic BCs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We
      demonstrate that PHTS-derived BCs have a distinct somatic mutational landscape
      compared to the sporadic counterparts, namely second somatic hits in PTEN,
      distinct mutational signatures, and increased genomic instability. The PHTS group
      had a significantly higher frequency of somatic PTEN variants compared to TCGA
      (22.7% versus 5.6%; odds ratio [OR] 4.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.21 to
      10.98; p < 0.001) and a lower mutational frequency in PIK3CA (22.7% versus 33.4%;
      OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.22; p = 0.15). Somatic variants in PTEN and PIK3CA were
      mutually exclusive in PHTS (p = 0.01) but not in TCGA. Our findings have
      important implications for the personalized management of PTEN-related BCs,
      especially in the context of more accessible genetic testing.

AB  - Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) are a powerful approach to
      identify genes whose expression is associated with complex disease risk. However,
      non-causal genes can exhibit association signals due to confounding by linkage
      disequilibrium (LD) patterns and eQTL pleiotropy at genomic risk regions, which
      necessitates fine-mapping of TWAS signals. Here, we present MA-FOCUS, a
      multi-ancestry framework for the improved identification of genes underlying
      traits of interest. We demonstrate that by leveraging differences in
      ancestry-specific patterns of LD and eQTL signals, MA-FOCUS consistently
      outperforms single-ancestry fine-mapping approaches with equivalent total sample 
      sizes across multiple metrics. We perform TWASs for 15 blood traits using
      genome-wide summary statistics (average nEA = 511 k, nAA = 13 k) and
      lymphoblastoid cell line eQTL data from cohorts of primarily European and African
      continental ancestries. We recapitulate evidence demonstrating shared genetic
      architectures for eQTL and blood traits between the two ancestry groups and
      observe that gene-level effects correlate 20% more strongly across ancestries
      than SNP-level effects. Lastly, we perform fine-mapping using MA-FOCUS and find
      evidence that genes at TWAS risk regions are more likely to be shared across
      ancestries than they are to be ancestry specific. Using multiple lines of
      evidence to validate our findings, we find that gene sets produced by MA-FOCUS
      are more enriched in hematopoietic categories than alternative approaches (p =
      2.36 x 10(-15)). Our work demonstrates that including and appropriately
      accounting for genetic diversity can drive more profound insights into the
      genetic architecture of complex traits.

LID - pyac045 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyac045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subanesthetic ketamine infusions can elicit rapid and sustained
      antidepressant effects, yet the potential cognitive impact of ketamine has not
      been thoroughly examined. This study measured changes in objective and subjective
      cognitive function following repeated ketamine treatment. METHODS: Thirty-eight
      patients with treatment-resistant depression were administered cognitive
      assessments before and after undergoing 7 intravenous ketamine infusions (0.5
      mg/kg over 40 minutes) within a clinical trial examining the efficacy of single
      and repeated administrations. Depression severity and perceived concentration
      were evaluated with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the
      Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms Self-Report (QIDS-SR16). RESULTS:
      Twenty-three participants (60.5%) responded after repeated infusions (>/= 50%
      decrease in MADRS total scores). We measured significant improvements in several 
      cognitive domains including attention, working memory, verbal and visuospatial
      memory (effect sizes ranging from Cohen's d = 0.37-0.79). Cognitive changes were 
      attributed to reduction in depressive symptoms except for improvement in verbal
      memory which remained significant after adjustment for change in MADRS total
      score (P = .029, etap2 = 0.13). Only responders reported improvement in
      subjective cognitive function with repeated ketamine administration (MADRS item
      6, P < .001, d = 2.00; QIDS item 10, P < .001, d = 1.36). CONCLUSION: A short
      course of repeated ketamine infusions did not impair neurocognitive function in
      patients with treatment-resistant depression. Further research is required to
      understand the potential mediating role of response and remission on improved
      cognitive function accompanying ketamine treatment as well as to examine
      longer-term safety outcomes.

      longitudinally influenced by the physiological age effect on motor coordination. 
      To enable longitudinal quantitative interpretation of ataxia by SARA in children 
      with EOA, the EPNS ataxia working group has previously determined SARA-scores in 
      typically developing children (4-16 years of age). In toddlers, this information 
      is still lacking. We therefore aimed to investigate the feasibility and
      reliability of SARA-scores in typically developing toddlers. METHODS: In 57
      typically developing toddlers (2-4 years), we aimed to determine the: 1.
      feasibility of SARA-scores, 2. age-related pre-requisites to obtain SARA-scores
      in toddlers over all domains, 3. SARA-score reliability, 4. mathematical age
      connection of SARA-scores in toddlers and older children. RESULTS: In typically
      developing toddlers, the feasibility of SARA is strongly age-dependent (p <
      .000). After computing compensations for two age-related, unfeasible and
      therefore un-assessable kinetic subtasks and after allowing the videotaping of
      non-kinetic SARA sub-task performances at home, the SARA was fully reliably
      assessable in all (n = 57) toddlers (ICC = 0.732). From two to 16 years of age,
      SARA-scores were mathematically represented by one continuous, exponentially
      decreasing trend line approaching the adult-optimum at 16 years of age.
      CONCLUSION: In toddlers, SARA-scores are reliably assessable, by using two
      age-compensations and allowing the videotaping of SARA-performances partly at
      home. In children with EOA, these data enable longitudinal quantification and
      interpretation of quantitative ataxia-scores by SARA from 2 years of age
      throughout childhood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis (TRAS) is a recognized vascular
      complication after kidney transplantation. The overall risk predictors of TRAS
      are poorly understood. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with suspected
      TRAS (Doppler ultrasound PSV > 200 cm/s) who underwent angiographic study in a
      single center between 2007 and 2014. All patients with stenosis > 50% were
      considered with TRAS. Stenosis restricted in the body of the artery was also
      analyzed in a subgroup. RESULTS: 274 patients were submitted to a renal
      angiography and 166 confirmed TRAS. TRAS group featured an older population (46.3
      +/- 11.0 vs. 40.9 +/-14.2 years; p = 0.001), more frequent hypertensive
      nephropathy (30.1% vs. 15.7%; p = 0.01), higher incidence of Delayed Graft
      Function (DGF) (52.0% vs. 25.6%; p < 0.001) and longer Cold Ischemia Time (CIT)
      (21.5 +/- 10.6 vs. 15.7 +/- 12.9h; p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses, DGF (OR
      = 3.31; 95% CI 1.786.30; p < 0.0001) was independent risk factors for TRAS. DM
      and CIT showed a tendency towards TRAS. The compound discriminatory capacity of
      the multivariable model (AUC = 0.775; 95% CI 0.7180.831) is significantly higher 
      than systolic blood pressure and creatinine alone (AUC = 0.62; 95% CI
      0.558-0.661). In body artery stenosis subgroup, DGF (OR = 1.86; 95% CI 1.043.36; 
      p = 0.03) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) (OR = 2.44; 95% CI 1.314.60; p = 0.005) were
      independent risk factors for TRAS. CONCLUSION: In our transplant population, DGF 
      increased more than 3-fold the risk of TRAS. In the subgroup analysis, both DGF
      and DM increases the risk of body artery stenosis. The addition of other factors 
      to hypertension and renal dysfunction may increase diagnostic accuracy. TRAS

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Seasonal media reports often describe the dangers of pumpkin
      carving, yet little data exists regarding the actual incidence of hand injuries
      resulting from pumpkin carving. The purpose of this study is to describe,
      quantify, and trend ED encounters associated with pumpkin-related knife injuries.
      METHODS: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) was queried
      for pumpkin-related knife injuries from 2012 to 2021. Patient demographic and
      injury data was collected and analyzed to describe trends in incidence, patient
      demographics, and injury patterns associated with an ED encounter for a
      pumpkin-related knife injury. RESULTS: There were an estimated 20,579 (95% CI:
      17,738-23,420) pumpkin-related knife injuries from 2012 to 2021. The incidence of
      pumpkin-related knife injuries remained stable over time (R(2) = 0.195, P =
      0.201). Hand injuries comprised 87.6% of all injuries, with the thumb (33.5%) and
      index finger (25.0%) most commonly affected. Men and women were injured at
      similar rates (51.6% vs 48.4%). The most common demographic injured were 10 to
      19-year olds (31.5%) followed by children <10-years old (19.5%). Women ages 10 to
      19-years old were the most commonly injured subgroup (10.0% of all injuries).
      Most ED presentations occurred on Saturdays (16.5%) or Sundays (23.3%). The large
      majority occurred during the months of October (83.5%) followed by November
      (11.2%), with almost half of all cases (45.6%) occurring in the last week of
      October. Peak incidence of injury occurred on October 30th. CONCLUSION:
      Pumpkin-related knife injuries are a preventable cause of hand injury with
      predictably high-incidence in fall months. Additionally, our data suggests
      further precautions should be taken to prevent injury in pediatric patients.
      Understanding at-risk populations in addition to implementing public safety
      initiatives and education on safe pumpkin-carving techniques could prevent
      serious injuries in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To observe the changes in the bladder of fetal rats with
      myelomeningocele (MMC) induced by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) during the
      embryonic development stages. METHODS: The fetal rat model of MMC was induced by 
      intragastric administration of atRA to pregnant rats on embryonic day 10 (E10).
      Fetal rats were harvested at E16, E18, E20, and E21 for observation and further
      testing. Those with MMC were classified as the MMC group, while those without MMC
      as the RA group. The areas of MMC skin defect, the crown-rump length (CRL), and
      body weight in different groups were compared. The histopathological changes in
      the bladder were compared. The expression levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin
      (alphaSMA), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC), connexin 43 (Cx43), desmin,
      beta3 tubulin, and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in the bladder
      were investigated by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Pregnant 
      rats given intragastric administration with olive oil (OIL group) at E10 were set
      as the blank control group. RESULTS: A total of 415 fetal rats of different
      gestational ages were harvested with an MMC incidence of 56.05 % (139/248). The
      incidence rate increased with embryonic days (p < 0.001). Compared with the other
      two control groups, the CRL and bodyweight of MMC fetal rats were significantly
      delayed at E21 (p < 0.001). The expression levels of alphaSMA, SMMHC, Cx43,
      desmin, beta3 tubulin and VAChT in the bladder of MMC fetal rats were
      significantly decreased at E21 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In atRA-induced MMC fetal
      rats, there is neural, muscular, and stromal dysplasia in the bladder at an early
      gestational age. Further investigations on neurogenic bladder secondary to MMC
      are applicable using this animal model.

AB  - Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is considered a fatal complication of cyclophosphamide 
      (CP). Down-regulation of Nrf2 and induction of pro-inflammatory mediators are the
      main pathological factors. Recently, ameliorative potential of the angiotensin II
      (AII) type-1 (AT1) receptor blocker olmesartan (OLM) on oxidative stress and
      inflammatory cytokines was reported. The current study aims to investigate the
      possible protective effect of OLM on CP-induced HC in Wistar rats. The animals
      were divided into the control group (0.5% W/V carboxymethylcellulose, p.o.); OLM 
      group (20 mg/kg, p.o., for 21 days); CP group (a single dose of 100 mg/kg, i.p.);
      and the remaining groups that received CP i.p. with oral OLM 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg
      for 21 days, respectively. The bladder tissue was collected for histopathology,
      immunohistochemistry, ELISA, Western blot, and oxidative stress assay. The OLM at
      doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg attenuated increase in TNF-alpha, IL-6, NF-kB, iNOS, and
      COX-2 induced by CP. Additionally, it up-regulated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, bladder
      GSH content, and CAT and SOD activities. The data indicated that OLM inhibited
      ROS-induced NF-kB, which caused inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
      activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Hence, OLM holds great promise for
      preventing CP-induced HC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the trend of
      cancer-related death rates between 2009 and 2019 in Turkey for all cancers
      combined and the five cancer types with the highest mortality: lung, stomach,
      pancreas, breast, and colon cancers. METHODS: Cancer mortality data were obtained
      from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) and standardized by age using
      the World Health Organization (WHO) standard population ratios. The change in
      cancer-related mortality over the years was evaluated using Joinpoint Regression 
      Analysis (JRA). RESULTS: Total cancer-related deaths increased by 2.2% annually
      between 2009 and 2014 and decreased by 2.9% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p <
      0.05). Among men; lung cancer-related deaths increased by 2.4% annually between
      2009 and 2014 and decreased by 3.4% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p < 0.05),
      stomach cancer-related deaths decreased by 5.1% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p
      < 0.05), colon cancer-related deaths increased by 5.8% annually between 2009 and 
      2015 and decreased by 3.3% annually between 2015 and 2019 (p < 0.05), pancreatic 
      cancer-related deaths increased annually by 5.6% in 2009-2013 (p < 0.05). Among
      women; lung cancer-related deaths increased by 2.5% annually between 2009 and
      2016 (p < 0.05), stomach cancer-related deaths increased annually by 2.3% between
      2009 and 2014 and decreased annually by 4.5% between 2014 and 2019 (p < 0.05),
      colon cancer-related deaths increased by 2.5% annually between 2009 and 2017 (p <
      0.05), pancreatic cancer-related deaths increased by 7.4% annually between 2009
      and 2013 (p < 0.05) and breast cancer-related deaths increased by 2.2% annually
      between 2009 and 2019 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mortality data in Turkey are
      collected only by TURKSTAT, which raises concern regarding the incompletion of
      the data. While this might lead to underestimation, the trend shows that there
      has been a decrease in total cancer-related deaths in Turkey. Pancreatic cancer, 
      on the other hand, gains a higher proportion in cancer-related deaths in Turkey
      as in the world. Increasing deaths from lung and breast cancer in women remind of
      the importance of tobacco control interventions and cancer screening programs.

AB  - Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, like Polybrominated diphenyl ethers
      (PBDEs), is suspected of playing a role in the occurrence of breast cancer.
      Moreover, there is growing evidence that food chemical contaminants, especially
      lipophilic ones such as PBDEs, could interact with different components of the
      diet. The objective of the present study was to assess the association between
      dietary intake of PBDEs and breast cancer risk in the French E3N cohort study,
      and to investigate the potential modification of this association by vegetable
      oil consumption. The study included 67879 women. Intakes of eight PBDEs were
      estimated using food consumption data from a validated semi-quantitative food
      frequency questionnaire, and food contamination levels measured by the French
      Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES). Cox
      proportional hazards models were used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95%
      Confidence Intervals (CI) for the association between total PBDEs dietary intake 
      and breast cancer risk. Interaction measures for vegetable oil consumption were
      estimated on both additive and multiplicative scales. The women were followed for
      a maximum of 21.4 years, and 5 686 developed an incident breast cancer. A
      positive linear trend was highlighted between dietary intake of PBDEs in quintile
      groups and breast cancer risk, borderline with statistical significance (p-trend 
      = 0.06, HRQ5vsQ1 and 95% CI: 1.09 [0.99;1.20]). Interaction measures for
      vegetable oil consumption were significant in both additive and multiplicative
      scales. Higher effect sizes of the association were highlighted in high consumers
      of vegetable oil, i.e. >/=4.6 g/day (HRQ5vsQ1 and 95% CI: 1.23 [1.08; 1.40]), and
      almost no effect were found in low consumers (HRQ5vsQ1 and 95% CI: 0.97 [0.86;
      1.10]). Highlighting such interactions between nutrients and chemicals is crucial
      to develop efficient dietary recommendations to limit the negative health effects
      associated with exposure to food chemical contaminants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: While food insecurity is a global public health problem associated 
      with obesity, diabetes, hypertension and coronary heart disease, literature
      regarding the relationship between food insecurity and erectile dysfunction (ED) 
      is scarce. AIM: We aimed to determine the associations between food insecurity
      and ED in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. METHODS: Data was
      extracted from 3,891 participants (aged >/= 20 years) with ED in the 2001-2004
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Multivariable logistic
      regression analysis with sampling weights was conducted to evaluate the
      associations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Food security was assessed utilizing the
      Household Food Security Module. A single-question self-report from the
      Massachusetts Male Aging Study was utilized to evaluate ED status. RESULTS:
      Approximately 10.2% of individuals had food insecurity. Food insecurity was
      significantly associated with ED after full adjustment (odds ratio [OR] 1.56; 95%
      confidence interval [95% CI] 1.16-2.09; P = .003). Men with very low food
      insecurity had 59% higher risks of ED compared with those having high food
      security (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.13-2.27; P = .006). Moreover, the associations were
      stronger in the old people (age >/= 60) (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.26-3.66; P = .004).
      CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity might be associated with higher risks of developing 
      ED. Wang W, Chen J, Peng L, et al. Food Insecurity May be an Independent Risk

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data for selpercatinib [a selective REarranged during Transfection
      (RET) inhibitor] from a single-arm trial (LIBRETTO-001, NCT03157128) in
      RET-fusion-positive advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were
      used in combination with external data sources to estimate comparative efficacy
      [objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival, and overall survival
      (OS)] in first- and second-line treatment settings. METHODS: Patient-level data
      were obtained from a de-identified real-world database. Patients diagnosed with
      advanced/metastatic NSCLC with no prior exposure to a RET inhibitor and one or
      more prior line of therapy were eligible. Additionally, individual patient-level 
      data (IPD) were obtained from the pemetrexed + platinum arm of KEYNOTE-189
      (NCT03950674, first line) and the docetaxel arm of REVEL (NCT01168973,
      post-progression). Patients were matched using entropy balancing, doubly robust
      method, and propensity score approaches. For patients with unknown/negative RET
      status, adjustment was made using a model fitted to IPD from a real-world
      database. RESULTS: In first-line unadjusted analyses of the real-world control,
      ORR was 87.2% for LIBRETTO-001 versus 66.7% for those with RET-positive NSCLC (P 
      = 0.06). After adjustment for unknown RET status and other patient
      characteristics, selpercatinib remained significantly superior versus the
      real-world control for all outcomes (all P < 0.001 except unadjusted
      RET-fusion-positive cohort). Similarly, outcomes were significantly improved
      versus clinical trial controls (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest
      improvement in outcomes associated with selpercatinib treatment versus the
      multiple external control cohorts, but should be interpreted with caution. Data
      were limited by the rarity of RET, lack of mature OS data, and uncertainty from
      assumptions to create control arms from external data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the implementation of an antihypertensive pathway order set 
      to improve treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy and the postpartum
      period in the inpatient setting. STUDY DESIGN: A multi-disciplinary task force
      created a hypertensive pathway order set and provided staff training. The order
      set allowed providers to initiate a treatment algorithm, which then gave nurses
      guidelines to recheck blood pressures and progressively increase short-acting
      antihypertensive dosage if needed. Pregnant and postpartum patients documented to
      have >/=2 consecutive severe range blood pressures in the year prior (2017) and
      the year after (2019) implementation of the pathway were included. Primary
      outcomes included whether any antihypertensive was given, whether it was given
      for all instances of severe hypertension, and time to antihypertensive
      administration. RESULTS: A total of 566 patients with severe hypertension were
      included-304 in the pre-implementation year and 262 in the post-implementation
      year. Significantly more patients received an antihypertensive at least once (67 
      % versus 80 %, p < 0.01) and for all instances of severe hypertension (29 %
      versus 47 %, p < 0.01) in the post-intervention cohort. There was a significant
      improvement in time to antihypertensive administration (24 versus 10 min, p <
      0.01). CONCLUSION: This study evaluates the efficacy of an antihypertensive
      intervention in the Southeast United States, which is particularly significant
      given the region's higher rates of hypertension and hypertension-related
      mortality. This study provides confirmatory evidence that implementation of a
      standardized order set along with measuring compliance and staff education is

AB  - BACKGROUND: Casting is a common procedure in the treatment of extremity
      fractures, but it can lead to serious complications if applied improperly.
      However, there are few studies on the prevalence of cast-related complications.
      PURPOSE: To assess the frequency of cast-related complications and influencing
      factors in patients referred to medical centers affiliated with a University of
      Medical Sciences. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted on 120 patients with
      limb fractures in need of casting. The study was conducted from November 1, 2020,
      to June 1, 2021. A checklist was used to assess complications, and complications 
      were monitored by regular telephone contact. Each patient was followed up for 3
      months. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data.
      RESULTS: Pain, impaired mobility, numbness, swelling, and a burning sensation
      inside the cast were the most common complications in the first week after cast
      application and occurred in 94.2%, 72.5%, 60.8%, 60%, and 54.2% of patients,
      respectively. Patients whose casts were applied by a nurse experienced more pain 
      (p = 0.002), numbness (p = 0.02), and swelling (p = 0.05). The incidence of
      numbness was significantly higher in patients who were more active during
      convalescence (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the importance of cast-related
      complications, in-service training programs for casting staff are needed.
      Furthermore, patient education and follow-up should be taken more seriously.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine the refined estimates of the surgical
      effects on the short- and long-term prognoses of oldest-old patients (aged >/=80 
      years) with glioblastomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Surveillance,
      Epidemiology, and End Results registry, we identified the oldest-old patients
      with glioblastomas between 2005 and 2016. Propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier
      analysis, Cox regression analysis, and competing risk model were used to assess
      the curative efficacy of the surgical treatments. Stratification and interaction 
      analysis were performed to explore the potential interaction effects. The
      conditional survival rates were calculated to explore the longitudinal change in 
      the survival probability over time. RESULTS: This study enrolled 3309 patients
      with a median overall survival of 3 months. The overall survival differed
      significantly among the different surgical groups. Considering the gross total
      resection as reference, subtotal resection presented adjusted subdistribution
      hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.197 (1.052-1.362; p < 0.001);
      biopsy/partial resection, 1.242 (1.083-1.424; p = 0.002); and no surgery, 1.309
      (1.145-1.497; p < 0.006). Age >/= 83 years, widowed/other status, tumor size 4-5 
      cm, and temporal tumors showed significant interaction effects. The adjusted
      subdistribution hazard ratio of radical resection was 0.729 (0.645-0.825; p <
      0.001). Based on disease-specific survival, the 1-year survival rate was 18% and 
      26% for the non-radical and radical surgery groups, respectively. The 1-year
      conditional survival rates in the second year were 54% and 39% in the non-radical
      and radical surgery groups, respectively. The 3-year survival rates were 10% in
      both the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Radical surgery may have short-term benefits in the
      oldest-old patients with glioblastoma, with a significant increase in the 1-year 
      survival rate. However, its contribution in the long-term outcome is limited due 
      to decreased conditional survival rates from the second year after surgery.
      Prudent patient selection and improved postoperative management may be needed to 
      promote the therapeutic efficacy of tumor resection synergistically.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency may be a risk factor for thyroid disorder; however,
      the relationship between iron deficiency and thyroid disorder as well as
      mechanism involved remain unclear. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional
      study was conducted to analyze the correlation between iron status and thyroid
      hormone levels in pregnant women. A total of 2218 pregnant women were recruited, 
      and iron status and thyroid hormones were measured. Canonical correlation, Lasso 
      regression, and Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used
      to determine the association and related factors. RESULTS: There were 219 cases
      with iron deficiency anemia (IDA), 168 cases with iron deficiency (ID), and 1831 
      subjects with normal iron status. Compared with normal group, free
      triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) in ID group and IDA group had a
      significant decreasing trend (P < 0.05), with the lowest levels in IDA group.
      Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was significantly increased in ID group and IDA
      group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the proportion of hypothyroidism in both ID group and
      IDA group was higher than the normal group, meanwhile the proportion of
      hyperthyroidism was lower in both groups (P < 0.05). Serum ferritin (SF) and
      hemoglobin (Hb) were positively correlated with FT3 and FT4 but negatively
      correlated with TSH. Correlation analysis indicated that iron status was
      associated with thyroid hormone levels (P < 0.05). Lasso regression analysis
      showed that SF, Hb and other variables could be included in the prediction model 
      of FT4. The variables selected by Lasso model were used for ROC curve analysis,
      and the prediction accuracy was acceptable (AUC=0.778, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our
      study indicated that there is an association between iron status and thyroid
      hormone levels in pregnant women, and the level of FT4 may change with iron
      status. Our findings provide new ideas for regulating the thyroid hormone levels 
      to prevent thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy.

AB  - Studies conducted during the COVID-19 Pandemic have reported increased rates of
      mental illnesses including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) [1]. A common symptom of mental illness is change in Rapid Eye
      Movement (REM) sleep, the phase of sleep associated with dreaming and nightmares.
      The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of
      systemic stress on nightmares. In this study, we investigate whether the COVID-19
      pandemic affects nightmare frequency and content using a web-based survey within 
      the state of New Mexico. The survey returned 197 responses showing an increase in
      the quantity of both bad dreams and nightmares. Furthermore, significant changes 
      in nightmare themes were reported compared to relative rates prior to the
      pandemic (RR 1,42, p < 0.01; RR 5, p < 0.001). This novel data supports that
      increased stress from the COVID-19 pandemic has altered dream and nightmare
      content and frequency.

AB  - Essentially all grazing horses are infected with cyathostomin parasites. Adult
      cyathostomins reside in the large intestine of the horse and larval stages encyst
      within intestinal mucosa. Manual worm collection from aliquots of intestinal
      content is the current gold standard for retrieval and enumeration of luminal
      parasites, however, no research has been conducted to standardize specific
      parameters for processing and storage of samples. The aims of this study were (1)
      to evaluate the precision of current standard operating procedures for
      enumeration of luminal adult cyathostomin populations, (2) investigate the
      influence of chosen fixative, either 70 % ethanol or 10 % buffered formalin, as
      well as storage duration, immediately post necropsy vs. stored for eight weeks,
      on the magnitude and precision of worm counts, and (3) compare the luminal count 
      magnitude between the three intestinal segments (cecum, ventral colon, dorsal
      colon). Ten miniature horses were enrolled in this study for euthanasia and
      necropsy over a four-week period. Luminal worm counts were conducted for 2 %
      aliquots of the cecum, ventral colon, and dorsal colon and samples were allocated
      to the two fixatives and the two storage durations. Precision was evaluated by
      coefficient of variation (CV) and was 13.04 % for total cyathostomin counts. Mean
      CV for large intestinal segments ranged from 15.31 % to 52.50 % irrespective of
      fixative used or storage duration. cecum worm counts were significantly lower
      compared to the ventral colon (p = 0.008) and dorsal colon (p = 0.01). Fixative
      and storage duration were not statistically associated with count precision or
      magnitude. This study demonstrated moderate to high precision estimates for
      luminal cyathostomin worm counts but did not identify any effects of fixative and
      storage duration within the framework of the study. This is the first study to
      determine cyathostomin worm count precision, and results will be useful for power
      analyses in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of narrow-band imaging (NBI) for the
      post-treatment surveillance of patients with laryngeal cancers and to compare the
      diagnostic value of NBI with that of white light endoscopy (WLE). METHODS: We
      searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang Data, and CNKI databases.
      Study quality and potential bias were assessed by the updated Quality Assessment 
      of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool (QUADAS-2). Data analyses were performed
      with Meta-Disc. Publication bias was assessed by Deek's funnel plot asymmetry
      test. The protocol used in this article is in accordance with the PRISMA
      checklist. RESULTS: Seven studies including 628 lesions were included in this
      meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio for
      the NBI diagnosis of cancerous lesions were 0.92 (95 % CI: 0.84-0.96), 0.94 (95 %
      CI: 0.91-0.96), and 142.10 (95 % CI: 61.51-328.28), respectively. The area under 
      receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.97. Among the seven studies, three
      studies evaluated the diagnostic value of WLE, with a sensitivity of 0.53 (95 %
      CI: 0.38-0.69), a specificity of 0.94 (95 % CI: 0.90-0.97), and a diagnostic odds
      ratio of 14.75 (95 % CI: 1.72-126.87). The evaluation of heterogeneity,
      calculated per the diagnostic odds ratio, gave an I(2) of 0. No marked
      publication bias (p = 0.75) was found in our meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: NBI
      exhibits high diagnostic accuracy in the post-treatment follow-up of laryngeal
      cancer patients and is superior to that of traditional WLE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is diagnosed incidentally in some
      patients with minimal or no respiratory symptoms. The clinical features of such
      patients are unknown. Herein we aimed to clarify the prevalence, clinical course,
      and prognostic factors of patients who were incidentally diagnosed with IPF.
      METHODS: The files of consecutive patients with newly diagnosed IPF were
      retrospectively reviewed to determine the methods involved in their diagnosis,
      and their outcomes. RESULTS: Among a total of 107 patients with newly diagnosed
      IPF, 35 (32.7%) were diagnosed incidentally, including 18 undergoing annual
      health check-ups and 17 undergoing assessment for other medical problems. The
      median survival from the time of diagnosis was 4.9 years for the 35 patients
      diagnosed incidentally, which was comparable to the median survival of 3.9 years 
      for the 72 who were not diagnosed incidentally. The body mass index (BMI) was the
      sole independent predictor of survival (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence
      interval 0.65-0.93, p = 0.006) in patients diagnosed incidentally. CONCLUSIONS:
      Nearly one third of patients with IPF were diagnosed incidentally, and their
      survival was still poor. Identifying patients during the earliest stage of IPF,
      particularly those with a low BMI, is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular events commonly cause death in amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS) even in patients treated by noninvasive ventilation (NIV).
      OBJECTIVES: to evaluate autonomic function with the assessment of heart rate
      variability (HRV) in ALS patients treated by assist pressure control ventilation 
      (APCV) and assist control ventilation (ACV) during sleep. METHODS: Consecutive
      ALS patients underwent one polysomnography during APCV and one during ACV. HRV
      was analyzed both in the total sleep period (from first stage N1 to last
      awakening) and in a 5-minute period of stable stage N2. Time domain, frequency
      domain and nonlinear indexes of HRV were measured. RESULTS: Nineteen patients
      (age 62.0 +/- 8.7, 9F/10 M) were studied. The analysis did not reveal differences
      in blood gasses between NIV modalities, but a longer expiratory time (3.01+/-0.6 
      vs 2.8 +/- 0.6 s, respectively APCV vs ACV, p = 0.001) and a lower arousal index 
      (17.5 +/- 9.1 vs 23.1 +/- 13.9, p = 0.02) during APCV. HRV was indicative of
      higher vagal activity during APCV, especially in the 5-minute periods. In the
      total sleep periods, the HRV time domain indexes reflecting parasympathetic
      activity were positively correlated with the expiratory time and negatively with 
      the inspiratory/expiratory time ratio. Low frequencies were positively, and high 
      frequencies negatively, correlated with inspiratory time. HRV and sleep structure
      parameters were not correlated, except very low frequencies that were correlated 
      to the arousal index. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory influences on autonomic control
      can be preserved in ALS. The slower breathing pattern during APCV may help to
      maintain a higher vagal activity. Through this mechanism, in the long-term APCV
      could more beneficial to ALS patients than ACV.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is a common condition with high morbidity and mortality, causing 
      irreversible neuronal damage and seriously affecting neurological function. There
      has been no ideal effective treatment so far. The NX210 peptide is derived from
      the thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) sequence of SCO-spondin, and has been
      reported to exert various neurogenic properties. This study investigated whether 
      NX210 had therapeutic effects and possible underlying mechanisms against cerebral
      ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Therefore, primary embryonic rat cortical neurons and
      Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats that were subjected to oxygen-glucose
      deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and middle cerebral artery
      occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) injuries, respectively, were treated with or
      without NX210. We found that NX210 reduced OGD/R-induced cell viability loss and 
      cytotoxicity. NX210 decreased cerebral infarct volume and brain edema,
      ameliorated neurological dysfunction, attenuated oxidative stress damage, and
      diminished neuronal apoptosis in MCAO/R rats. Furthermore, western blot analysis 
      shown that treatment with NX210 up-regulated the expression of Integrin-beta1,
      phosphorylated-PI3K (p-PI3K) and phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt). The Integrin-beta1
      specific inhibitor, ATN-161, was used to identify pathways involved. The
      anti-oxidation activities and anti-apoptosis of NX210 was reversed by treatment
      with ATN-161. Overall, our results indicated that NX210 prevents oxidative stress
      and neuronal apoptosis in cerebral I/R via upregulation of the
      Integrin-beta1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These results indicated that NX210 may
      be a promising therapeutic candidate for ischemic stroke.

AB  - After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many office workers transitioned to
      working-from-home (WFH) which altered routine physical activity (PA). To
      understand how these workers' PA were affected throughout the pandemic, PA data
      collected in January, April, June, and December 2020 with an activity tracker and
      a validated survey were analyzed. Between January and December, it was found that
      step counts during the weekday decreased (p < 0.01), weekday heart rate was
      higher than weekends (p < 0.01), activity-tracker and self-reported PA decreased 
      (p < 0.01), and sitting time increased (p < 0.01). To understand the agreement
      between the objective and subjective METs, Bland-Altman analyses were completed
      and demonstrated an acceptable level of agreement. Findings show decreased level 
      of PA amongst WFH office workers and that the activity tracker and survey are
      reliable methods of recording WFH PA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in medial meniscus extrusion (MME) due to abnormal
      biomechanical stress leads to knee osteoarthritis (OA) progression. MME
      evaluation during walking is a key method of detecting dynamic changes in the
      meniscus, and in combination with motion analysis, can provide a deeper
      understanding of the mechanisms involved in the increase of MME. OBJECTIVE: To
      validate the feasibility of MME dynamic evaluation in combination with a motion
      analysis system based on the correlation between the increase in MME and
      biomechanical factors. METHODS: Twenty-three knees from 23 patients with mild to 
      moderate knee OA were analysed in this study. The medial meniscus during walking 
      was evaluated by ultrasound. The increase in MME was calculated as the difference
      between the minimum and maximum MME during walking. A three-dimensional motion
      analysis system was synchronised with the ultrasound and then, biomechanical
      factors such as knee moment and ground reaction force were evaluated. RESULTS:
      The wave patterns of the mediolateral and vertical components of ground reaction 
      forces and knee adduction moment were similar to those in the MME based on a high
      cross-correlation coefficient (>0.8). The increase in MME was significantly
      correlated with the peak value of the knee adduction moment (r = 0.54, P =
      0.0073) but not with the mediolateral and vertical components of the ground
      reaction force. CONCLUSION: The findings show that knee adduction moment is
      correlated with an increase in MME during walking and indicates the validity and 
      feasibility of the dynamic evaluation of MME in combination with a motion
      analysis system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The anterolateral complex has been demonstrated to assist with
      rotational stability and prevention of anterior tibial translation during the
      pivot shift. In this study the Segond fracture is used as a surrogate for an
      anterolateral complex injury to determine if there is an association between
      Segond fracture and increased posterior tibial slope. METHODS: Patients' charts
      and radiographs were analyzed retrospectively for the presence of Segond
      fractures on injury radiographs. These patients, the Segond cohort, were then age
      and gender matched to a control cohort. Demographic as well MRI measurements of
      medial and lateral posterior tibial slope and lateral-to-medial slope asymmetry
      were collected for each cohort. Secondary outcome of anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction failure data was also collected. RESULTS: The Segond group
      demonstrated a statistically significantly greater lateral posterior tibial slope
      (8.42 degrees versus 6.55 degrees , P = 0.003) as well as medial posterior tibial
      slope (6.57 degrees versus 5.34 degrees degrees, P = 0.045). There was no
      significant differences between lateral-to-medial asymmetry (2.18 degrees versus 
      1.83 degrees , P = 0.246). CONCLUSION: Patients with Segond fractures at the time
      of anterior cruciate ligament injury have increased medial and lateral posterior 
      tibial slope. This may relate to increased rotational and translational
      instability associated with anterolateral complex injuries. Surgeons treating
      these patient may use this information to counsel their patients on the risks of 
      associated pathology at the time of arthroscopy such as lateral meniscal
      posterior root tears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate axial load resistance of
      the tibia depending on the thickness of tibial tuberosity osteotomy in medial
      open-wedge distal tuberosity proximal tibial osteotomy (OWDTO). The hypothesis is
      that a thin tibial tuberosity osteotomy shows high axial load resistance of the
      tibia. METHODS: The OWDTO model was constructed from imitation bones of the
      tibia. Distal tibial tuberosity osteotomy was performed with thicknesses of 7,
      14, and 21 mm (n = 5 for each group). Cyclic axial-load fatigue tests were
      performed to investigate the strain at five measurement points on the OWDTO
      model. An axial-load failure test was also performed to investigate the maximum
      strain for failure. RESULTS: The 7-mm OWDTO model showed a significantly lower
      stain range than the 14-mm model at the middle part of the lateral hinge (P =
      0.0263, mean difference: -852.6 muepsilon), posterior part (P = 0.0465, mean
      difference: -1040.0 muepsilon), posterior tibial cortex (P < 0.0001, mean
      difference: -583.4 muepsilon), and plate (P = 0.0029, mean difference: -121.6
      muepsilon). There were no significant differences in the strain at the tibial
      tuberosity between the groups. The axial load for complete failure was
      significantly higher in the 7-mm model than in the 21-mm model (P = 0.0010, mean 
      difference: 2577.0 N). The failure points were at the lateral hinges.
      CONCLUSIONS: Thinner distal tibial tuberosity osteotomy is more resistant to
      axial load and may be recommended for the prevention of tibial and lateral hinge 
      fractures after OWDTO.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autopsy studies have provided valuable insights into the
      pathophysiology of COVID-19. Controversies remain about whether the clinical
      presentation is due to direct organ damage by SARS-CoV-2 or secondary effects,
      such as overshooting immune response. SARS-CoV-2 detection in tissues by RT-qPCR 
      and immunohistochemistry (IHC) or electron microscopy (EM) can help answer these 
      questions, but a comprehensive evaluation of these applications is missing.
      METHODS: We assessed publications using IHC and EM for SARS-CoV-2 detection in
      autopsy tissues. We systematically evaluated commercially available antibodies
      against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins in cultured cell lines and COVID-19 autopsy
      tissues. In a multicentre study, we evaluated specificity, reproducibility, and
      inter-observer variability of SARS-CoV-2 IHC. We correlated RT-qPCR viral tissue 
      loads with semiquantitative IHC scoring. We used qualitative and quantitative EM 
      analyses to refine criteria for ultrastructural identification of SARS-CoV-2.
      FINDINGS: Publications show high variability in detection and interpretation of
      SARS-CoV-2 abundance in autopsy tissues by IHC or EM. We show that IHC using
      antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid yields the highest sensitivity and
      specificity. We found a positive correlation between presence of viral proteins
      by IHC and RT-qPCR-determined SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (N= 35; r=-0.83, p-value 
      <0.0001). For EM, we refined criteria for virus identification and provide
      recommendations for optimized sampling and analysis. 135 of 144 publications
      misinterpret cellular structures as virus using EM or show only insufficient
      data. We provide publicly accessible digitized EM sections as a reference and for
      training purposes. INTERPRETATION: Since detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human autopsy
      tissues by IHC and EM is difficult and frequently incorrect, we propose criteria 
      for a re-evaluation of available data and guidance for further investigations of 
      direct organ effects by SARS-CoV-2. FUNDING: German Federal Ministry of Health,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are metabolites of arachidonic acid 
      that may impact atherosclerosis, and animal experimental studies suggest EETs
      protect cardiac function. Plasma EETs are mostly esterified to phospholipids and 
      part of an active pool. To address the limited information about EETs and CVD in 
      humans, we conducted a prospective study of total plasma EETs (free + esterified)
      and diabetes-related CVD in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). METHODS: We
      measured 4 EET species and their metabolites, dihydroxyepoxyeicosatrienoic acids 
      (DHETs), in plasma samples from 892 CHS participants with type 2 diabetes. We
      determined the association of EETs and DHETs with incident myocardial infarction 
      (MI) and ischemic stroke using Cox regression. FINDINGS: During follow-up (median
      7.5 years), we identified 150 MI and 134 ischemic strokes. In primary,
      multivariable analyses, elevated levels of each EET species were associated with 
      non-significant lower risk of incident MI (for example, hazard ratio for 1 SD
      higher 14,15-EET: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.72-1.02; p=0.08). The EETs-MI associations
      became significant in analyses further adjusted for DHETs (hazard ratio for 1 SD 
      higher 14,15-EET adjusted for 14,15-DHET: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63-0.91; p=0.004).
      Elevated EET levels were associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke in
      primary but not secondary analyses. Three DHET species were associated with
      higher risk of ischemic stroke in all analyses. INTERPRETATION: Findings from
      this prospective study complement the extensive studies in animal models showing 
      EETs protect cardiac function and provide new information in humans. Replication 
      is needed to confirm the associations. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health.

AB  - Environmental pollution induced by heavy metals has been identified as a leading 
      threat in the modern era. Woody tree species may play a crucial role in the
      removal of heavy metals from soil and air, thus minimizing pollution potential.
      The present study was designed to evaluate the phytoremediation potential of six 
      tree species; Azadirachta indica, Cassia fistula, Conocarpus erectus, Eucalyptus 
      camaldulensis, Morus alba, and Populus deltoids, respectively, in the industrial 
      and residential areas of Faisalabad based on the concentrations of lead (Pb),
      zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and copper (Cu) in their leaves and barks in winter
      (2018) and summer (2019) seasons. The seasonal contents of heavy metals in both
      the leaves and barks of these trees decreased in the order of: Zn > Pb > Cu > Cd 
      at both study sites. The highest heavy metal contents were recorded in the leaves
      and barks of trees grown in the industrial areas as compared to residential
      areas, with leaves and barks having higher contents of heavy metals in the summer
      than winter. The tree species exhibited significantly different capacity for
      heavy metal accumulation, with the accumulation of Cd decreased in the order of: 
      E. camaldulensis > M. alba > C. erectus > A. indica > P. deltoids > C. fistula,
      and while the order varied for different heavy metals. Overall, M. alba, E.
      camaldulensis and A. indica performed well in accumulating the targeted heavy
      metals from the ambient environment. Among the six tree species grown commonly in
      Faisalabad city, M. alba, E. camaldulensis, and A. indica are recommended for the
      industrial and residential areas due to their phytoremediation capacity for heavy
      metals.

AB  - TUBB2A tubulinopathy is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder with developmental
      delay, epilepsy, and less frequent malformations of cortical development compared
      to other tubulinopathies. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a male 
      subject harboring the heterozygous de novo TUBB2A variant c.[743C>T]
      (p.[Ala248Val]) were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using
      the CytoTune-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Invitrogen). Generated iPSCs
      showed a normal karyotype, expression of pluripotency markers, spontaneous in
      vitro differentiation in all three germ layers, and are a suitable human disease 
      model to analyze pathomechanisms underlying TUBB2A tubulinopathy and potential
      therapeutic targets.

      practices in Nairobi's informal settlements.

AB  - Host to one billion people around the world, informal settlements are especially 
      vulnerable to COVID-19 lockdown measures as they already lack basic services such
      as water, toilets, and secure housing. Additionally, many residents work in
      informal labor markets that have been affected by the lockdowns, resulting in
      further reductions in access to resources, including clean water. This study uses
      a cross-sectional design (n = 532) to examine the vulnerabilities of households
      to employment and business disruptions, water access and hygiene practices during
      the COVID-19 lockdowns between April and June 2020 in three informal settlements 
      in Nairobi, Kenya. We used survey questions from the Household Water Insecurity
      Experience Scale (HWISE) to investigate the relationship between employment and
      business disruptions, water access, and hygiene practices (i.e., hand washing,
      body washing, clothes washing, and being able to use or drink clean water). Of
      the sampled households, 96% were forced to reduce work hours during the
      lockdowns, and these households had 92% lower odds of being able to afford water 
      than households who did not experience a work hour reduction (OR = 0.08, p <
      .001). Household challenges in affording water were likely due to a combination
      of reduced household income, increased water prices, and pre-existing poverty,
      and were ultimately associated with lower hygiene scores (Beta = 1.9, p < .001). 
      Our results highlight a compounding tragedy of reduced water access in informal
      settlements that were already facing water insecurities at a time when water is a
      fundamental requirement for following hygiene guidelines to reduce disease burden
      during an ongoing pandemic. These outcomes emphasize the need for targeted
      investments in permanent water supply infrastructures and improved hygiene
      behaviors as a public health priority among households in informal settlements.

TI  - A Placebo-controlled double-blinded test of the biodiversity hypothesis of
      immune-mediated diseases: Environmental microbial diversity elicits changes in
      cytokines and increase in T regulatory cells in young children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: According to the biodiversity hypothesis of immune-mediated diseases,
      lack of microbiological diversity in the everyday living environment is a core
      reason for dysregulation of immune tolerance and - eventually - the epidemic of
      immune-mediated diseases in western urban populations. Despite years of intense
      research, the hypothesis was never tested in a double-blinded and
      placebo-controlled intervention trial. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to perform the first
      placebo-controlled double-blinded test that investigates the effect of
      biodiversity on immune tolerance. METHODS: In the intervention group, children
      aged 3-5 years were exposed to playground sand enriched with microbially diverse 
      soil, or in the placebo group, visually similar, but microbially poor sand
      colored with peat (13 participants per treatment group). Children played twice a 
      day for 20 min in the sandbox for 14 days. Sand, skin and gut bacterial, and
      blood samples were taken at baseline and after 14 days. Bacterial changes were
      followed for 28 days. Sand, skin and gut metagenome was determined by high
      throughput sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene. Cytokines were measured from
      plasma and the frequency of blood regulatory T cells was defined as a percentage 
      of total CD3 +CD4 + T cells. RESULTS: Bacterial richness (P < 0.001) and
      diversity (P < 0.05) were higher in the intervention than placebo sand. Skin
      bacterial community, including Gammaproteobacteria, shifted only in the
      intervention treatment to resemble the bacterial community in the enriched sand
      (P < 0.01). Mean change in plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration and IL-10 
      to IL-17A ratio supported immunoregulation in the intervention treatment compared
      to the placebo treatment (P = 0.02). IL-10 levels (P = 0.001) and IL-10 to IL-17A
      ratio (P = 0.02) were associated with Gammaproteobacterial community on the skin.
      The change in Treg frequencies was associated with the relative abundance of skin
      Thermoactinomycetaceae 1 (P = 0.002) and unclassified Alphaproteobacteria (P <
      0.001). After 28 days, skin bacterial community still differed in the
      intervention treatment compared to baseline (P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This is the 
      first double-blinded placebo-controlled study to show that daily exposure to
      microbial biodiversity is associated with immune modulation in humans. The
      findings support the biodiversity hypothesis of immune-mediated diseases. We
      conclude that environmental microbiota may contribute to child health, and that
      adding microbiological diversity to everyday living environment may support
      immunoregulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of maternal breastfeeding and maternal pain
      pre- and post-lingual frenulum release procedures in infants with ankyloglossia. 
      METHODS: Infants under 4 months of age with tongue-tie who were actively
      breastfeeding, and their mothers (mother-infant dyads) were recruited. Infants'
      ankyloglossia severity was evaluated using the Coryllos(R) ankyloglossia
      tongue-tie grading scale. Each mother completed a pre-procedure questionnaire
      where breastfeeding efficiency was evaluated using the LATCH(R) criteria. Each
      mother also reported a numeric score of pain with feeding, breastfeeding time,
      and a perceived feeding efficiency score. After the tongue-tie release procedure,
      each mother completed a post-procedure questionnaire within a 1-week to 1-month
      window to assess the change in breastfeeding efficiency using the LATCH(R)
      criteria, breastfeeding pain, breastfeeding time, and perceived breastfeeding
      efficiency. RESULTS: 41 mother-infant dyads participated in the study. No
      surgical complications occurred during or post-procedure. All dyads reported
      improved (40) or equal (1) LATCH(R) scores: with a mean improved LATCH(R) score
      of 3.2 points (p < 4^10(-15), 95% CI 2.6, 3.7.). The mean improved maternal
      perception of feeding was 3.3 points (p < 6^10(-10),95% CI 2.6, 4.0.), the mean
      decreased maternal pain was 4.0 points (p < 1^10(-14), 95% CI 3.3, 4.8), and the 
      mean decreased maternal feeding time was 0.80 points (p = 0.002, 95% CI 0.5,
      1.1.). CONCLUSION: Lingual frenulum release procedures appear to consistently
      improve breastfeeding efficiency and decrease maternal pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 80% of
      lung cancer diagnoses across the world. Despite recent appreciable improvements
      in treatment plans for patients with NSCLC, the prognosis for those with the
      cancer still remains poor. Recently, a growing number of studies have shown that 
      N-myristoyltransferases (NMTs) may be critical in carcinogenesis, however, the
      functional and clinical significance of this pathway in NSCLC remains unclear and
      requires further research. METHODS: Initially, we evaluated the expression levels
      of NMT1 or NMT2 in a clinical cohort comprising of 303 paired primary NSCLC
      tissues and matched normal mucosae by using ELISA. We subsequently performed a
      tissue microarray analysis (TMA) to confirm its expression pattern in an
      independent validation cohort (n = 78). Then, we used a publicly available KM
      plotter database (n = 1921) to evaluate the prognostic impact of NMT1 and NMT2 in
      NSCLC. Lastly, a series of in-vitro molecular/cellular and animal experiments
      were performed for mechanistic understanding of the role of
      N-myristoyltransferases in NSCLC. RESULTS: Our ELISA data revealed that the
      expression level of NMT1 and NMT2 was down-regulated in tumor tissues (n = 303, P
      < 0.0001), which was confirmed in an independent validation cohort by TMA (n =
      78, P = 0.014 for NMT1 and P < 0.0001 for NMT2). On the other hand, patients with
      low expression of NMT1 or NMT2 had shorter overall survival (P = 0.013, HR = 0.85
      for NMT1; P = 0.00059, HR = 0.8, for NMT2). Mechanistically, we revealed that the
      interaction and co-localization of NMT1 and NMT2 in NSCLC, and N-terminus of NMT1
      and NMT2 was observed to be crucial for their interaction as well as for their
      catalytic activity. Moreover, we found that NMT1 can significantly promote the
      expression of NMT2 by enhancing its stability. We corroborated these findings by 
      performing functional assays in which the knockout of NMT1 and NMT2 resulted in
      enhanced cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as increased
      tumorxenograftgrowth. In addition, we identified miR-182 as a novel regulator of 
      both NMT1 and NMT2. More specifically, the overexpression or inhibition of
      miR-182 modulated globe N-myristoylation level, contributed to phenotypic
      alterations in NSCLS cells. CONCLUSIONS: NMT1 and NMT2 can act as potential tumor
      suppressors in NSCLC, and the inhibition of miR-182 expression or therapeutic
      NMTs replenishment may be a promising treatment option for patients with NSCLC.

LID - 10.1016/j.prp.2022.154044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, several studies investigated the complex process
      called "reprogramming" of seminoma (S) cells. The accepted pathogenetic model is 
      a complex network including SOX2, SOX17, OCT3/4 and PRAME, which modulates the
      epigenetic transcription of numerous downstream genes and drives a divergent gene
      expression profile resulting in the transition from pure S (P-S) to S component
      (S-C) of mixed germ cell tumors of the testis (M-GCTT), and finally to embryonal 
      carcinoma (EC). Herein, we tested a large cohort of GCTT with SOX2 and PRAME to
      evaluate their expression in the evolutionary steps of GCTT and verify if the
      modulation in the expression of these two molecules could be relevant for the
      fate of GCTT. METHODS: We tested 43, 19 and 17 consecutive and retrospectively
      enrolled cases of GCTT, germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) and uninvolved
      background testes (UBT), respectively. SOX2 and PRAME expressions have been
      evaluated with H-score and compared by adopting the appropriate statistic tests
      (Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test). RESULTS: We found that SOX2 was more 
      expressed by nonseminomatous-GCTT (NS-GCTT) (p < 0.001) and EC (p < 0.001) rather
      than S; by contrast, PRAME showed an opposite expression profile being expressed 
      by S but not by NS-GCTT (p < 0.001) and EC (p < 0.001). S-C showed different
      expressions of SOX2 and PRAME compared to both P-S (p = 0.002 and <0.001,
      respectively) and EC (p < 0.001 and 0.042, respectively), with intermediate
      values between these latter two categories. GCNIS and UBT showed no expression of
      SOX2 (scattered positive Leydig cells) but high H-score levels of PRAME.
      CONCLUSIONS: SOX2 and PRAME are differentially expressed and specularly modulated
      during the "reprogramming" of S cells [P-S (high levels of PRAME, no
      expression/low levels of SOX2) --> S-C (intermediate levels of PRAME,
      intermediate levels of SOX2) --> EC (no expression/low levels of PRAME, high
      levels of SOX2)], therefore supporting a complex pathogenetic model where the
      interactions between these two molecules are crucial in determining the fate of
      GCTT.

      cornerstone of treatment; however, optimal factors regarding the extent of
      fibrosarcoma resection in localized versus regional disease is poorly understood.
      METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for
      patients who are 19 y old or younger with a diagnosis of fibrosarcoma from 1975
      to 2016. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed for disease-specific survival on
      clinical and pathologic variables. Multivariate analysis was performed based on
      significant predictors of disease-specific survival. RESULTS: There were 1290
      patients (median age 13 [7-17] y) identified with fibrosarcoma. The overall
      survival rate at 20 y was 93%. Radical resection was performed on 22%, 40%, and
      52% of patients with localized, regional, and distant Surveillance, Epidemiology,
      and End Results disease stage, respectively. Chemotherapy (P < 0.001), radiation 
      (P < 0.001), histology (P < 0.001), and stage (P = 0.004) were significant
      predictors of increased mortality using univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis. Most
      patients (86%) with localized or regional stage who underwent radiation had
      fibrosarcomas of nondermatofibrosarcoma histology (P < 0.001).
      Dermatofibrosarcoma subtype comprised most radical resections (41%). Excluding
      distant stage, nondermatofibroma histology (hazard ratio 16.94, 95% confidence
      interval 3.77-76.01) and regional stage (hazard ratio 8.15, 95% confidence
      interval 2.93-22.69) were independent prognostic factors of mortality (both P <
      0.001). Radical resection was not a significant independent prognostic indicator 
      of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Nondermatofibrosarcoma subtype is independently
      associated with increased mortality. Although surgery remains the mainstay of
      treatment, the extent of resection is not a predictor of survival for patients
      with the localized and regional stage of disease.

AB  - (piv)ZPhos, as an effective ligand in the Cu-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation
      of ketones and aminoboration of alkenes, is prepared efficiently from the
      corresponding triflate of P-chiral dihydrobenzoazaphosphole 1. However, the
      previous approach to 1 by chiral separation is time-consuming and costly,
      preventing its production and further application on a large scale. In this
      report, a practical method for the large-scale preparation of 1 was developed via
      chiral chemical resolution with (1S,2S)-diaminocyclohexane as an effective
      resolution reagent.

TI  - Psychophysiological Responses to Self-Selected Exercise Intensity Over the
      Menstrual Cycle: A Randomized Crossover Phase Trial.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/02701367.2022.2036316 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This study investigated the psychophysiological responses during
      self-selected exercise intensity over the course of the menstrual cycle (MC).
      Methods: Seventeen healthy women with regular MCs completed three randomized
      treadmill bouts of 30 min of self-selected exercise intensity during
      menstruation, mid-follicular, and late luteal phases. Anxiety, menstrual distress
      (i.e., pain, behavior change, autonomic reaction, fluid retention, and negative
      affect) and profile of mood (i.e., tension, depression, and anger) were measured 
      before exercise. Arousal, heart rate (HR), motivation, rating of perceived
      exertion and affective valence were measured before, during and after each
      exercise session. Results: Anger, anxiety, behavior change, pain, and negative
      affect were significantly greater (p < .05) during menstruation compared to the
      mid-follicular phase, whereas fluid retention, anger, behavior change, and
      autonomic reaction were greater (p < .05) during the late luteal phase compared
      with the mid-follicular phase. Participants felt more negative affective valence 
      and less motivation to start exercise during menstruation compared with other MC 
      phases. Average treadmill speed (5.8 +/- 1.1 vs 6.0 +/- 0.7 vs 5.9 +/- 0.7
      km/h(-1), p = .36) and %HRmax (74.9 +/- 3.2 vs 77.8 +/- 5.4 vs 77.4 +/- 7.1%, p =
      .40) did not differ between menstruation, mid-follicular, and late luteal phases.
      Also, noteworthy is that participants self-selected an intensity that exceeded
      the minimum levels recommended for health and cardiorespiratory fitness promotion
      (64-70% HRmax). Conclusions: Results of this study indicate that
      psychophysiological responses are negatively impacted mainly during menstruation 
      and the late luteal phase of the MC. These findings may be helpful for
      professionals who work to promote the initiation and maintenance of exercise in
      women.

TI  - Race Is Associated with Risk of Salvage Procedures and Postoperative
      Complications After Hip Procedures in Children with Cerebral Palsy.
LID - 10.1097/BPO.0000000000002216 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the many surgical interventions available for spastic hip
      dysplasia in children with cerebral palsy, a radical salvage hip procedure may
      still ultimately be required. The purpose of this study was to assess whether
      race is an independent risk factor for patients with cerebral palsy to undergo a 
      salvage hip procedure or experience postoperative complications for hip dysplasia
      treatment. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis utilizing the
      American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
      (NSQIP) Pediatric database from 2012 to 2019. International Classification of
      Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modifications (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM),
      and current procedural terminology (CPT) codes were used to identify patients
      with cerebral palsy undergoing hip procedures for hip dysplasia and to stratify
      patients into salvage or reconstructive surgeries. RESULTS: There was a total of 
      3906 patients with cerebral palsy between the ages of 2 and 18 years undergoing a
      procedure for hip dysplasia, including 1995 (51.1%) White patients, 768 (19.7%)
      Black patients, and 1143 (29.3%) patients from other races. Both Black (P=0.044) 
      and White (P=0.046) races were significantly associated with undergoing a salvage
      versus a reconstructive hip procedure, with Black patients having an increased
      risk compared to White patients [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.77, confidence
      interval (CI) 1.02-3.07]. Only Black patients were found to have an increased
      risk of any postoperative complication compared to White patients, with an
      adjusted OR of 1.26 (CI 1.02-1.56; P=0.033). Both White (P=0.017) and black
      (P=0.004) races were found to be significantly associated with medical
      complications, with Black patients having an increased risk (adjusted OR 1.43, CI
      1.12-1.84) compared to White patients. There were no significant findings between
      the race and risk of surgical site complications, unplanned readmissions, or
      reoperations. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patient race is an
      independent association for the risk of pediatric patients with cerebral palsy to
      both undergo a salvage hip procedure and to experience postoperative medical
      complications, with Black patients having an increased risk compared to White.
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III Retrospective Cohort Study.

LID - 10.1177/07334648221117524 [doi]
AB  - Depression is common within the first year of relocation to residential
      care/assisted living (RC/AL). Yet, few studies investigate the relationship
      between depression and relocation factors that might help identify at-risk
      residents, such as previous location. This study analyzed cross-sectional
      resident data (n = 2651) from the National Survey of Residential Care Facilities 
      to test: (1) group differences between residents relocating from acute/post-acute
      facilities (e.g., hospital, rehabilitation facility) and community-based
      residences, and (2) the relationship between previous location and depression
      within the first year of relocation. The 921 (35%) residents relocating directly 
      from acute/post-acute facilities were more likely to have depression (p < .001)
      and poorer outcomes on select health and psychosocial variables. After
      controlling for covariates, relocating directly from an acute/post-acute facility
      significantly related to depression (OR = 1.22). Findings highlight opportunities
      to improve routine screening and transitional care for this subpopulation of
      RC/AL residents at heightened risk for depression.

TI  - Preliminary evaluation of the effects of grapiprant compared with carprofen on
      acute pain and inflammation following ovariohysterectomy in dogs.
LID - 10.2460/ajvr.21.10.0162 [doi]
LID - ajvr.21.10.0162 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the analgesic efficacy of grapiprant to carprofen for the
      treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation in dogs following
      ovariohysterectomy. ANIMALS: 12 purpose-bred adult sexually intact female
      Beagles. PROCEDURES: Dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups:
      grapiprant (2 mg/kg, PO; n = 6) or carprofen (4.4 mg/kg, PO; n = 6), 1.5 hours
      prior to ovariohysterectomy (OVH) and every 24 hours afterward for 3 total doses.
      An ultrafiltration probe was placed within the OVH incision to collect
      interstitial fluid (ISF). Pain and inflammation were assessed by masked
      investigators via mechanical nociceptive threshold testing and the short form of 
      the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale before drug administration and at multiple time 
      points for 72 hours following dosing and surgery. ISF samples were collected at
      the same time points to assess prostaglandin E2 concentrations at the site of
      inflammation. RESULTS: In both groups, pain scale scores were highest in the
      immediate postoperative period and decreased over time. In both treatment groups,
      there were significant (P = 0.003) differences in mechanical nociceptive
      threshold results over time when compared with baseline, but there was no
      difference between groups. Prostaglandin E2 concentrations in ISF were higher in 
      dogs receiving grapiprant compared with carprofen (P < 0.001). One dog in the
      carprofen group required rescue analgesia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of this
      preliminary study suggested both carprofen and grapiprant may be effective for
      postoperative pain following OVH in dogs; however, additional studies are
      warranted to determine grapiprant's effectiveness in a larger and more diverse
      population of dogs.

TI  - Effect of repeated administration of a parenteral feline herpesvirus-1,
      calicivirus, and panleukopenia virus vaccine on select clinicopathologic,
      immunological, renal histologic, and immunohistochemical parameters in healthy
      adult cats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether hyperinoculation of cats with a feline
      herpesvirus-1, calicivirus, and panleukopenia virus (FVRCP) vaccine could be used
      as a model to study interstitial nephritis and to assess humoral and
      cell-mediated immune responses toward vaccinal alpha-enolase. ANIMALS: 6 healthy 
      young adult purpose-bred research cats. PROCEDURES: Baseline renal cortical
      biopsies, whole blood, serum, and urine were collected prior to administration of
      a commercial FVRCP parenteral vaccine. Vaccine hyperinoculation was defined as a 
      total of 8 vaccinations given at 2-week intervals over a 14-week period. Blood
      samples were collected immediately prior to each vaccination, and a second renal 
      biopsy was performed 2 weeks after hyperinoculation (week 16). Renal
      histopathology, renal alpha-enolase immunohistochemistry, and assays to detect
      humoral and cell-mediated immune reactions against Crandell-Rees feline kidney
      (CRFK) cell lysates and alpha-enolase were performed. An alpha-enolase
      immunoreactivity score for renal tubules and glomeruli based on signal intensity 
      was determined by a blinded pathologist. RESULTS: Hyperinoculation with the
      vaccine was not associated with clinicopathologic evidence of renal dysfunction, 
      and interstitial nephritis was not recognized by light microscopy in the time
      studied. The mean serum absorbance values for antibodies against CRFK antigen and
      alpha-enolase were significantly (P < 0.001) higher at weeks 4, 8, and 16 versus 
      week 0. Renal tubular and glomerular alpha-enolase immunoreactivity scores were
      higher at week 16 compared to baseline. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings suggested
      that systemic immunological reactions occurred and renal tissues were affected by
      vaccine hyperinoculation; however, short-term FVRCP vaccine hyperinoculation
      cannot be used to study interstitial nephritis in cats.

TI  - Effect of epitendinous suture augmentation to a double Krackow suture pattern for
      canine gastrocnemius tendon repair.
LID - 10.2460/ajvr.21.07.0100 [doi]
LID - ajvr.21.07.0100 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a double Krackow suture pattern (DK), with
      and without epitendinous suture augmentation (ES), in a canine gastrocnemius
      tendon (GT) model. SAMPLE: Paired GTs from 12 adult dog cadavers and 4 control
      GT. PROCEDURES: GTs were assigned to 2 groups (n = 12/group). Transverse tenotomy
      was performed and repaired with a DK or DK + ES. Yield, peak, and failure force, 
      stiffness, occurrence of 1-and 3-mm gapping, and failure mode were examined.
      RESULTS: Yield, peak, and failure loads were greater for DK + ES. Yield force was
      48% greater for DK + ES (mean +/- SD, 149.56 +/- 53.26 N) versus DK (101.27 +/-
      37.17 N; P = 0.017). Peak force was 45% greater for DK + ES P < 0.001). Failure
      force was 47% greater for DK + ES (193.752 +/- 31.43 N) versus DK (131.54 +/-
      22.28 N; P < 0.001). Construct stiffness was 36% greater for DK + ES (P = 0.04). 
      All 12 DK and 10 of 12 DK + ES repairs produced a 1-mm gap, with all DK and 4 DK 
      + ES repairs producing a 3-mm gap (P < 0.001). Loads required to create a 3-mm
      gap were significantly greater for DK + ES (P < 0.013). Suture breakage occurred 
      in all DK repairs, which differed from DK + ES, where suture breakage (7/12) and 
      tissue failure (5/12; P = 0.037) predominated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Augmentation
      of a primary DK repair with an ES significantly improved construct strength in
      canine GT constructs while increasing loads required to cause 1- and 3-mm gap
      formation, respectively. ES augmentation is a simple technique modification that 
      can be used to significantly increase construct strength, compared with DK alone.

LID - 10.2460/ajvr.21.07.0090 [doi]
LID - ajvr.21.07.0090 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the translation and angular rotation of the distal
      sesamoid bone (DSB) using computed tomography (CT) and medical modeling software.
      SAMPLE: 30 thoracic limbs from equine cadavers. PROCEDURES: Partial (n = 12),
      full (8), and matched full and subsequently transected (10) thoracic limbs were
      collected. Bone volume CT images were acquired in three positions: extension (200
      degrees metacarpophalangeal angle), neutral (180 degrees ), and maximal flexion
      (110 degrees ). Mean translation and angular rotation of each DSB were recorded. 
      Differences were determined with two-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's tests for
      pairwise comparisons; P value was set at < 0.05. RESULTS: Dorsal translation was 
      significant during extension (1.4 +/- 0.4 mm full limbs and 1.3 +/- 0.2 mm
      partial limbs, P < 0.001). Distal translation was significant during extension
      (1.9 +/- 0.4 mm full and 1.1 +/- 0.4 mm partial) and flexion (5.4 +/- 0.7 mm full
      and 6.22 +/- 0.6 mm partial, P < 0.001). Rotation was significant (P < 0.001)
      about the mediolateral axis during extension (17.1 degrees +/- 1.4 degrees ) and 
      flexion (2.6 degrees +/- 1.3 degrees ). Translation and rotation of the DSB were 
      significantly different (P < 0.001) between full and partial limbs. CLINICAL
      RELEVANCE: This study provides the first quantification of translation and
      angular rotation of the DSB within the equine hoof. Partial limbs had
      significantly reduced movement compared to full limbs, suggesting that
      transection of flexor tendons alters distal thoracic limb kinematics. Further
      studies are required to determine if pathologic changes in the podotrochlear
      apparatus have an impact in clinical lameness outcomes.

TI  - Revalidation of an ultra-short scale for the measurement of perceived job
      security in Latin America.
PG  - e002545
LID - 10.5867/medwave.2022.07.002545 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Due to the measures imposed by governments to reduce the spread of 
      this new virus, the economic sector was one of the most affected during the
      COVID-19 pandemic. Several labor sectors had to undergo a virtual adaptation
      process resulting in job instability and job loss. The objective of this study
      was to revalidate an ultra-short scale for measuring perceived job security in
      Latin America. Methods: A revalidation study was done on a short scale that
      measures worker's perceived security about losing or keeping their job in the
      near future. Results: The four items remained on the revalidated scale, where all
      four explained a single factor. The goodness-of-fit measures confirmed the
      single-factor model (chi: 7.06; df: 2; p = 0.29; mean square error: 0.015;
      goodness-of-fit index: 0.998; adjusted goodness-of-fit index: 0.991; comparative 
      fit index: 0.999; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.997; normalized fit index: 0.998;
      incremental fit index: 0.999; and root mean square error of approximation:
      0.036). The scale's reliability was calculated using McDonald's omega
      coefficient, obtaining an overall result of omega = 0.72. Conclusions: The scale 
      was correctly revalidated in Latin America, and the four items were kept in a
      single reliable factor.

TI  - Live-Cell RNA Imaging with Metabolically Incorporated Fluorescent Nucleosides.
LID - 10.1021/jacs.2c04142 [doi]
AB  - Fluorescence imaging is a powerful method for probing macromolecular dynamics in 
      biological systems; however, approaches for cellular RNA imaging are limited to
      the investigation of individual RNA constructs or bulk RNA labeling methods
      compatible primarily with fixed samples. Here, we develop a platform for
      fluorescence imaging of bulk RNA dynamics in living cells. We show that
      fluorescent bicyclic and tricyclic cytidine analogues can be metabolically
      incorporated into cellular RNA by overexpression of uridine-cytidine kinase 2. In
      particular, metabolic feeding with the tricyclic cytidine-derived nucleoside tC
      combined with confocal imaging enables the investigation of RNA synthesis,
      degradation, and trafficking at single-cell resolution. We apply our imaging
      modality to study RNA metabolism and localization during the oxidative stress
      response and find that bulk RNA turnover is greatly accelerated upon NaAsO2
      treatment. Furthermore, we identify cytoplasmic RNA granules containing RNA
      transcripts generated during oxidative stress that are distinct from canonical
      stress granules and P-bodies and co-localize with the RNA helicase DDX6. Taken
      together, our work provides a powerful approach for live-cell RNA imaging and
      reveals how cells reshape RNA transcriptome dynamics in response to oxidative
      stress.

TI  - Partial Breast Irradiation Versus Whole Breast Irradiation for Early Breast
      Cancer Patients in a Randomized Phase III Trial: The Danish Breast Cancer Group
      Partial Breast Irradiation Trial.
PG  - JCO2200451
LID - 10.1200/JCO.22.00451 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: On the basis of low risk of local recurrence in elderly patients with
      breast cancer after conservative surgery followed by whole breast irradiation
      (WBI), the Danish Breast Cancer Group initiated the noninferiority external-beam 
      partial breast irradiation (PBI) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
      NCT00892814). We hypothesized that PBI was noninferior to WBI regarding breast
      induration. METHODS: Patients operated with breast conservation for relatively
      low-risk breast cancer were randomly assigned to WBI versus PBI, and all had 40
      Gy/15 fractions. The primary end point was 3-year grade 2-3 breast induration.
      RESULTS: In total, 865 evaluable patients (434 WBI and 431 PBI) were enrolled
      between 2009 and 2016. Median follow-up was 5.0 years (morbidity) and 7.6 years
      (locoregional recurrence). The 3-year rate of induration was 9.7% for WBI and
      5.1% for PBI, P = .014. Large breast size was significantly associated with
      induration with a 3-year incidence of 13% (WBI) and 6% (PBI) for large-breasted
      patients versus 6% (WBI) and 5% (PBI) for small-breasted patients. PBI showed no 
      increased risk of dyspigmentation, telangiectasia, edema, or pain, and patient
      satisfaction was high. Letrozole and smoking did not increase the risk of
      radiation-associated morbidity. Sixteen patients had a locoregional recurrence
      (six WBI and 10 PBI), P = .28, 20 patients had a contralateral breast cancer, and
      eight patients had distant failure (five WBI and three PBI). A nonbreast second
      cancer was detected in 73 patients (8.4%), and there was no difference between
      groups. CONCLUSION: External-beam PBI for patients with low-risk breast cancer
      was noninferior to WBI in terms of breast induration. Large breast size was a
      risk factor for radiation-associated induration. Few recurrences were detected
      and unrelated to PBI.

TI  - Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities in Delay to Initiation of
      Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy.
PG  - OP2200104
LID - 10.1200/OP.22.00104 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Delays in initiation of radiotherapy may contribute to inferior
      oncologic outcomes that are more commonly observed in minoritized populations in 
      the United States. We aimed to examine inequities associated with delayed
      initiation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      National Cancer Database was queried to identify the 10 cancer sites most
      commonly treated with IMRT. Interval to initiation of treatment (IIT) was broken 
      into quartiles for each disease site, with the 4(th) quartile classified as
      delayed. Multivariable logistic regression for delayed IIT was performed for each
      disease site using clinical and demographic covariates. Differences in magnitude 
      of delay between subsets of patients stratified by race and insurance status were
      evaluated using two-sample t-tests. RESULTS: Among patients (n = 350,425) treated
      with IMRT between 2004 and 2017, non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, and Asian
      patients were significantly more likely to have delayed IIT with IMRT for nearly 
      all disease sites compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients. NHB, Hispanic,
      and Asian patients had significantly longer median IIT than NHW patients (NHB 87 
      days, P < .01; Hispanic 76 days, P < .01; Asian 74 days, P < .01; and NHW 67
      days). NHW, Hispanic, and Asian patients with private insurance had shorter
      median IIT than those with Medicare (P < .01); however, NHB patients with private
      insurance had longer IIT than those with Medicare (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Delays
      in initiation of IMRT in NHB, Hispanic, and Asian patients may contribute to the 
      known differences in cancer outcomes and warrant further investigation,
      particularly to further clarify the role of different insurance policies in
      delays in advanced modality radiotherapy.

TI  - Transient Inhibition of Trastuzumab-Tumor Binding to Overcome the "Binding-Site
      Barrier" and Improve the Efficacy of a Trastuzumab-Gelonin Immunotoxin.
LID - MCT-22-0192 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-22-0192 [doi]
AB  - We have recently shown that co-administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with
      anti-idiotypic distribution enhancers (AIDEs) that inhibit mAb binding to tumor
      antigens enabled increased intra-tumoral mAb distribution and increased efficacy 
      of an antibody-drug conjugate (trastuzumab emtansine, T-DM1). In the present
      work, a PK/PD model was applied to predict the impact of this optimization
      strategy on the within-tumor distribution and anti-tumor efficacy of
      trastuzumab-gelonin, where the released payload (gelonin) is expected to exhibit 
      negligible bystander activity. Immunofluorescence histology was used to
      investigate trastuzumab-gelonin distribution in solid tumors following dosing
      with or without co-administration of anti-trastuzumab AIDEs. Anti-tumor efficacy 
      of trastuzumab-gelonin, with or without co-administration of AIDEs, was also
      evaluated in tumor-bearing mice. Trastuzumab-gelonin efficiently induced
      cytotoxicity when applied to NCI-N87 cells in culture (IC50: 0.224+/-0.079 nM).
      PK/PD simulations predicted that anti-idiotypic single-domain antibodies AIDEs
      with dissociation rate constants between 0.03-0.2 hour-1 would provide optimal
      enhancement of trastuzumab-gelonin efficacy. LE8 and 1HE, anti-trastuzumab AIDEs,
      were selected for evaluation in vivo. Co-administration of trastuzumab-gelonin
      with the inhibitors increased the portion of tumor area that stained positive for
      trastuzumab-gelonin by 58% (p=0.0059). Additionally, LE8 or 1HE co-administration
      improved trastuzumab-gelonin efficacy in NCI-N87 xenograft bearing mice by
      increasing the percent increase in life span (%ILS) from 27.8% (for
      trastuzumab-gelonin administered alone) to 62.5% when administered with LE8
      (p=0.0007) or 83.3% (p=0.0007) when administered with 1HE. These findings support
      the hypothesis that transient, competitive inhibition of mAb-tumor binding can
      improve the intra-tumoral distribution and efficacy of immunotoxins when applied 
      for treatment of solid tumors.

TI  - The impact of temporary methotrexate discontinuation for 1 week versus 2 weeks on
      seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
LID - 10.1002/art.42318 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether discontinuing methotrexate (MTX) for 1 week after
      seasonal influenza vaccination is non-inferior to discontinuing for 2 weeks in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: In this prospective randomized 
      parallel-group multi-center non-inferiority trial study, RA patients on a stable 
      dose of MTX were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 to hold MTX for 1 week or 2 
      weeks after receiving the quadrivalent 2021-2022 seasonal influenza vaccine
      containing H1N1, H3N2, B-Yamagata, and B-Victoria strains. The primary outcome
      was the proportion of patients with a satisfactory vaccine response, which was
      defined as >/=4-fold increase in hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers
      against two or more of the four vaccine strains 4 weeks after vaccination.
      RESULTS: The modified intention-to-treat population included 90 patients in the 1
      week MTX hold group and 88 patients in the 2 week MTX hold group. The MTX dose in
      the 1 week hold and the 2 week hold groups were 12.6 +/- 3.4 and 12.9 +/- 3.3
      mg/week, respectively. The proportion of satisfactory vaccine responses did not
      differ between the groups (68.9% vs. 75.0%, p = 0.364). The seroprotection rate
      and the fold increase in antibody titers to each of the four influenza antigens
      were similar between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Temporarily discontinuing MTX for 1
      week is non-inferior to MTX discontinuation for 2 weeks after vaccination to
      induce a satisfactory vaccine response to a seasonal influenza vaccine in
      patients with RA on a stable dose of MTX. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Effectiveness of exergaming-based interventions for mobility and balance
      performance in older adults with Parkinson's disease: systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
LID - afac175 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afac175 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: exergaming-based interventions (EbIs) have been proposed to improve
      older adults' mobility and balance performance. However, the effectiveness of
      such interventions for older adults with Parkinson's disease (OAPD) remains
      unclear. METHODS: seven databases (Web of Science, Medline, Academic Search
      Premier, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO, PsychARTICLE and PubMed) were searched up to 
      7 April 2022. We assessed mobility and balance performance between EbIs groups
      and control groups or traditional physical training interventions (TPTIs) groups 
      by comparing the outcomes of the Timed Up and Go (TUG), 6-Minute Walk Test
      (6MWT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), gait velocity, stride length and Functional
      Gait Assessment (FGA). RESULTS: we scanned 1,190 articles and meta-analysed 19
      trials (sample size = 781). In general, the results revealed statistical
      differences between EbIs groups and TPTIs groups in the TUG [mean difference (MD)
      = -1.030 s; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -2.029 to -0.031; P = 0.043; high
      quality of evidence], 6MWT (MD = 63.483 m; 95% CI = 9.542 to 117.425; P = 0.021; 
      moderate quality of evidence), BBS (MD = 2.129; 95% CI = -1.293 to 2.965; P <
      0.001; high quality of evidence) and FGA (MD = 2.099 95% CI = -0.306 to 3.893; P 
      = 0.022; moderate quality of evidence). No significant difference was discovered 
      between EbIs groups and TPTIs groups in enhancing gait velocity and stride
      length. CONCLUSIONS: EbIs are statistically better than TPTIs in improving OAPD's
      performance in TUG, 6MWT, BBS and FGA, whereas only the change between EbIs and
      TPTIs in 6MWT can reach the value of minimal clinically important difference.
      Further studies are needed to better assess the effectiveness of exergaming-based
      interventions.

TI  - Understanding the Reactivity of Combination Reactions of Intramolecular Geminal
      Group 13 Element/Phosphorus and Gallium/Group 15 Element Frustrated Lewis Pairs
      with CS2.
LID - 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c00259 [doi]
AB  - The reactions of CS2 captured by intramolecular geminal G13/P-based (G13 = group 
      13 elements) and Ga/G15-based (G15 = group 15 elements) frustrated Lewis pairs
      have been theoretically examined by using density functional theory (DFT)
      computations. With regard to the nine FLP-related compounds, our DFT calculated
      results reveal that only Al/P-Rea and Ga/P-Rea can kinetically and
      thermodynamically precede the energetically feasible combination reactions with
      CS2 to form the five-membered heterocyclic adducts. Our activation strain model
      analyses on the nine aforementioned model molecules indicate that the atomic
      radius of the Lewis acceptor (G13) and the Lewis donor (G15) plays a role in
      controlling their barrier heights to obtain good orbital overlaps among
      G13/P-Rea, Ga/G15-Rea, and CS2. Our theoretical observations based on the energy 
      decomposition analysis-natural orbitals for chemical valence (EDA-NOCV) approach 
      strongly indicate that the donor-acceptor bonding (i.e., singlet-singlet bonding)
      rather than the electron-sharing bonding (i.e., triplet-triplet bonding) plays a 
      central role in determining the bonding conditions of the transition states,
      G13/P-TS and Ga/G15-TS. In addition, the theoretical evidence obtained by the
      frontier molecular orbital theory and EDA-NOCV analyses reveals that the best
      description for the bonding natures of the combination reactions of
      intramolecular geminal G13/P-Rea and Ga/G15-Rea with CS2 is the lone pair(G15)
      --> p-pi*(C) interaction rather than the p-pi*(G13) <-- p-pi(S) interaction.
      Moreover, our present DFT computations concerning the calculated structures and
      corresponding relative energetics of the stationary points connected with the
      aforementioned sophisticated approaches are in accordance with the Hammond
      postulate.

TI  - Evaluating Operator Training Performance Using Recurrence Quantification Analysis
      of Autocorrelation Transformed Eye Gaze Data.
PG  - 187208221116953
LID - 10.1177/00187208221116953 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to investigate the relationship between gaze
      behaviour dynamics and operator performance. BACKGROUND: Individuals differ in
      their approach when learning a new task often resulting in performance disparity.
      During training some individuals learn the structure and dynamics of the task and
      develop a systematic approach, whereas others may achieve the same result albeit 
      with increased perceived workload, or indeed some may fail to achieve superior
      performance levels. Previous research has shown that comparing gaze of experts
      with novices can provide unique insights into cognitive functioning of superior
      performers. METHODS: Twenty-five individuals participated in a computer-based
      simulation task. The concept of coefficient of variation (CoV) of task scores was
      used to compute the participants' consistency of performance. Based on CoV, the
      cohort was split into two performance categories. The temporal patterns in
      participants gaze data were transformed using autocorrelation, and recurrence
      quantification analysis (RQA) was employed to analyse and quantify the patterns. 
      RESULTS: A Mann-Whitney U analysis demonstrated significantly (p < .01) higher
      determinism, entropy and laminarity in the superior group compared to the
      moderate group. Pearson's correlation revealed a significant (p < .01) negative
      correlation between the consistency of task performance (CoV) and the RQA
      measures. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that eye gaze dynamics can be used
      as an objective measure of performance. Participants classified as superior
      performers consistently demonstrated a systematic gaze activity which were in
      line with the task structure. APPLICATION: The methods presented here are
      applicable to observe and evaluate operators' strategic distribution of gaze.
      Specifically, for tactical monitoring and decision making in task environments
      where spatial locations of elements-of-interest vary continuously.

TI  - Real-world effectiveness of caplacizumab vs standard of care in immune thrombotic
      thrombocytopenic purpura.
LID - bloodadvances.2022008028 [pii]
LID - 10.1182/bloodadvances.2022008028 [doi]
AB  - Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy
      caused by anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies. Caplacizumab is approved for adults with an
      acute episode of iTTP in conjunction with PEX and immunosuppression. The
      objective of this study is to analyze and compare the safety and efficacy of
      caplacizumab versus the standard of care and assess the effect of the concomitant
      use of rituximab. A retrospective study from the Spanish TTP Registry of patients
      treated with caplacizumab vs those who did not receive it was conducted. A total 
      of 155 iTTP patients (77 caplacizumab, 78 no caplacizumab) were included.
      Patients initially treated with caplacizumab had fewer exacerbations (4.5% vs
      20.5% p<0.05) and less refractoriness (4.5% vs 14.1% p<0.05) than those that were
      not treated. Time to clinical response was shorter when caplacizumab was used as 
      initial treatment vs caplacizumab used after refractoriness or exacerbation. The 
      multivariate analysis showed that its use in the first 3 days after plasma
      exchange (PEX) was associated with a lower number of PEX (OR 7.5, CI 2.3-12.7;
      p<0.05) and days of hospitalization (OR 11.2, CI 5.6-16.9; p<0.001) compared to
      standard therapy. There was no difference in time to clinical remission in
      patients treated with caplacizumab compared to the use of rituximab. No severe
      adverse event was described in the caplacizumab group. In summary, caplacizumab
      reduced exacerbations and refractoriness compared to standard of care regimens.
      When administered within the first 3 days after PEX it also provided a faster
      clinical response, reducing hospitalization time and the need for PEX.

TI  - Effect of atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) on chlorine adapted Salmonella enterica
      on spring onion.
LID - 10.1111/lam.13799 [doi]
AB  - One of the main drawbacks of chlorine disinfectants is the emergence of chlorine 
      adapted (CA) or resistant microbial cells. This research aimed to investigate the
      effect of chlorine adaptation on resistance of Salmonella enterica upon
      atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) application at different voltages (6, 8, and 11 kV)
      and times (5, 10, and 15 min). Due to higher conversion efficiency and reduced
      dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) power consumption, this method was used for
      cold plasma generation in this study. A higher lethality effect was observed from
      a higher voltage and longest times (11 kV-15 min) on CA S. enterica than non-CA
      (p<0.05). Still, it induced higher percentages of injured cells in CA (58.77%)
      than non-CA (0.61%) (p<0.05). The highest ACP effect on the inactivation of the
      indigenous natural flora of onion leaves was observed at the lowest voltage
      (p<0.05). More than 3 log CFU/g reduction (p<0.05) was observed at 6 kV after 5
      and 10 min. ACP reduced CA and non-CA S. enterica cells on onion leaf surface to 
      a lower extent than pure treated cells in broth media. Nevertheless similar to
      broth media, a high percentage of injury (61.03%) was induced on CA cells at
      higher voltage (11 kV-10 min) compared to non-CA (2.15%) (p<0.05). Biofilm
      results revealed ACP application (6 kV-5 min) reduced average ODs in CA and
      non-CA cells (p<0.05). Chlorine adaptation and ACP treatment influenced the
      antibiotic resistance pattern according to applied voltage, time, and antibiotic 
      type. The finding showed despite highest lethality of high voltages and long
      times (11 kV-15 min), given the high percentages of injured cells, lower voltages
      may offer acceptable inactivation of pathogenic bacteria with lower injury
      induction. In conclusion, ACP has the potential ability to eliminate CA cells of 
      S. enterica, which is predominant in fresh-cut vegetable outbreaks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize the gross and histological lesions
      associated with air pollution in the lungs of dogs from various locations in
      Trinidad. ANIMALS: 56 fresh lungs were obtained from already euthanized adult
      dogs collected from different locations in Trinidad at the Trinidad and Tobago
      Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. PROCEDURES: Lung specimens were
      examined grossly and tissue samples were taken for routine histologic
      examination. RESULTS: Histological examination showed that 51.8% of the dogs had 
      evidence of anthracosis. Dogs with anthracosis had greater median lesion scores
      compared to dogs without anthracosis (P = .022). There was no association between
      the presence of anthracosis and any other lesion in this study (P > .05).
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There was evidence that dogs with anthracosis had a greater
      degree of nonspecific lung histologic lesions. Using the dog as a sentinel model 
      for human exposure in Trinidad, our findings indicate that environmental air
      pollution may also have an effect on the respiratory health of the human
      population. It is important for the public to be aware of air pollution, and the 
      government of Trinidad and Tobago should develop an intervention protocol along
      with veterinary and human medical epidemiologists to reduce air pollution in the 
      country.

TI  - Sex differences and adherence of patients treated with wearable
      cardioverter-defibrillator: insights from an international multicenter register.
LID - 10.1111/jce.15648 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Treatment with the wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) may protect
      against sudden cardiac death (SCD) as a bridging therapy until a
      cardioverter-defibrillator may be implanted. We analyzed in a multicenter setting
      a consecutive patient cohort wearing WCD to explore sex differences. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We analyzed 708 consecutive patients, 579 (81.8%) from whom were males
      and 129 (18.2%) females (age, 60.5+/-14 vs. 61.6+/-17 years old; p=0.44). While
      the rate of ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) as a cause of prescription of WCD was
      significantly higher in males as compared to females (42.7% vs. 26.4%; p=0.001), 
      females received it more frequently due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM)
      (55.8% vs. 42.7%); p=0.009). The wear time of WCD was equivalent in both groups
      (21.1+/-4.3 hours/days in males vs. 21.5+/-4.4 hours/days in females; p=0.27; and
      62.6+/-44.3 days in males vs. 56.5+/-39 days in females; p=0.15). Mortality was
      comparable in both groups at 2-year-follow-up (6.8% in males vs. 9.7% in females;
      p=0.55). Appropriate WCD shocks and the incidence of ICD implantations were
      similar in both groups (2.4% in males vs. 3.9% in females; p=0.07) (35.1% in
      males vs. 31.8% in females; p=0.37), respectively. In age tertile analysis,
      compliance was observed more in 73-91 years old group as compared to 14-51 years 
      old group (87.8% vs. 68.3%; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Compliance for wearing WCD was 
      excellent regardless of sex. Furthermore, mortality and the incidence of ICD
      implantations were comparable in both sexes. Appropriate WCD shocks were similar 
      in both sexes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Converting a Monolayered NbSe2 into an Ising Superconductor with Nontrivial Band 
      Topology via Physical or Chemical Pressuring.
LID - 10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c02422 [doi]
AB  - Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides possessing superconductivity and
      strong spin-orbit coupling exhibit high in-plane upper critical fields due to
      Ising pairing. Yet to date, whether such systems can become topological Ising
      superconductors remains to be materialized. Here we show that monolayered NbSe2
      can be converted into Ising superconductors with nontrivial band topology via
      physical or chemical pressuring. Using first-principles calculations, we first
      demonstrate that a hydrostatic pressure higher than 2.5 GPa can induce a p-d band
      inversion, rendering nontrivial band topology to NbSe2. We then illustrate that
      Te-doping can function as chemical pressuring in inducing nontrivial topology in 
      NbSe2-xTex with x >/= 0.8, due to a larger atomic radius and stronger spin-orbit 
      coupling of Te. We also evaluate the upper critical fields within both
      approaches, confirming the enhanced Ising superconductivity nature, as
      experimentally observed. Our findings may prove to be instrumental in material
      realization of topological Ising superconductivity in two-dimensional systems.

TI  - Impact of atrioventricular junction ablation and CRT-D on long-term mortality in 
      patients with left ventricular dysfunction, permanent, refractory atrial
      fibrillation and narrow QRS: results of a propensity matched analysis.
LID - 10.1111/jce.15645 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In patients with symptomatic permanent atrial fibrillation (PEAF)
      and narrow QRS, atrio-ventricular junction ablation (AVJA) plus cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) is superior to medical therapy in reducing heart 
      failure (HF) hospitalization and all-cause mortality. To compare the mortality of
      a population of patients with HF, reduced EF (rEF) and PEAF treated with AVJA
      plus CRT with that of a contemporary cohort of patients in sinus rhythm (SR) with
      similar baseline characteristics. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective,
      multicentre, observational study, all-cause mortality in a group of consecutive
      patients undergoing AVJA and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)
      combined with CRT implantation for HFrEF, narrow QRS, and PEAF with uncontrolled 
      ventricular rate was compared with that of a contemporary cohort of patients in
      SR undergoing ICD implantation (not combined with CRT) for HFrEF and narrow QRS. 
      Individual 1:1 propensity matching of baseline characteristics was performed. A
      total of 824 patients were enrolled. Propensity matching yielded 107 matched
      pairs. After a median follow-up of 52 months, all-cause mortality was similar in 
      patients treated with AVJA plus CRT and in the control group (p=0.434). In AVJA
      plus CRT patients, mortality was significantly lower than in control group
      patients with a history of paroxysmal/persistent AF (n=45, p=0.020), and similar 
      to that of patients without a history of AF (n=62, p=0.459). CONCLUSIONS: After
      adjustment for patient characteristics, the long-term prognosis of patients with 
      HFrEF, narrow QRS and PEAF who underwent AVJA plus CRT was similar to that of a
      population of patients in SR with similar characteristics. This article is

TI  - Spatial distributions of salt-based ions, a case study from the Hunshandake Sandy
      Land, China.
PG  - e0271562
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271562 [doi]
AB  - Soil water soluble base ion salt-based ion concentrations are critical parameters
      for estimating soil buffer capacity and vegetation productivity. Ionic content
      clearly covaries with the distribution of plant communities. Previous studies on 
      salt-based ions in soils focused primarily on ion migration and its relationships
      with vegetation growth. Few studies have sought to characterize larger scale
      spatial distribution of salt-based ions or correlation with climatic and plant
      community characteristics. This study used ion chromatography to analyze the
      salt-based ion content (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+) of surface soils from the
      Hunshandake sandy lands. Statistical methods were used interpret spatial
      variation. Results showed that the average content of salt-based ions in
      Hunshandake sandy land was 86.57 mg/kg. Average values ranked as Ca2+ > Na+ > K+ 
      > Mg2+ but concentrations also exhibited uneven spatial distributions. Horizontal
      spatial variation in Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ ions showed these ions gradually decrease
      from northwest to southeast. Potassium ions (K+) showed no obvious spatial
      variation trends. Ions varied significantly across different soil layers but
      their average concentrations ranked as K+>Na+>Ca2+>Mg2+ (from shallow to deep).
      The 20-30 cm soil layer contained the highest salt ion concentrations. Of the
      four base ions, only K+ ions appeared in surface samples. In terms of water
      soluble base ion available salt-based ions, Ca2+ occurred in the highest
      concentrations along the north and west side of the study area. K+ ions occurred 
      in the highest concentrations along the south and east sides of the study area.
      Na+ concentrations did not show a consistent spatial pattern. Statistical
      analysis detected significant correlations of normalized ion concentration
      parameters (Ca2+/CECT, K+/CEC, effective water soluble base ion salt-based ions) 
      and the total species number, average species number and total biomass of the
      plant communities (P <0.05). This study can help inform understanding of soil
      water transport in sandy areas and provide a reference for interpreting
      ecosystems in arid regions.

      stimulated by hexavalent chromium.
PG  - e0272528
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272528 [doi]
AB  - Over exploitation of mineral resources has increasingly caused serious heavy
      metal contamination such as chromium (Cr). Cr(VI), the pathogenicity factor, is
      one of common environmental contaminants and widely known health hazards to
      living organisms. Therefore, it is urgent to control the polluted soil. Up to
      now, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of Cr response in
      Pseudomonas sp. Cr13. In this study, transcriptome and differentially expressed
      genes in Pseudomonas sp. Cr13 strain was characterized by a comparison between
      Cr(VI)-treated sample and control sample using transcriptome sequencing approach.
      In total, 2974 genes were annotated, including 1245 (1154 down-regulated genes
      and 91 up-regulated genes) differentially expressed genes (DEGs). All DEGs could 
      be assigned to 29 pathways, of which pathways related to amino acid metabolism,
      carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism and signal transduction mechanism were
      significantly enriched in Pseudomonas sp. Cr13. A possible mechanism for Cr
      toxicity response might be an active efflux which utilized a heavy metal
      translocating P-type ATPase to lower the intracellular Cr concentration. The
      down-regulated genes related to the antioxidant defense system had a key role in 
      Cr reduction, such as SodA, Gst, osmC, BtuE, KatE, csdA and AhpC. The proteins
      that were visibly up-regulated, were likely to involve in alleviating Cr(VI)
      stress, and the significantly down-regulated genes such as MarR, Lrp, FhlA, GntR,
      HrcA, LysR family genes, were likely to reduce Cr(VI) induced oxidative stress.
      In addition, real-time quantitative PCR was used to analyze the expression
      patterns of some Cr responsive genes. This study reported the first
      identification of Cr responsive genes, and inferred the underlying regulatory
      mechanisms of response to Cr(VI) stress in Pseudomonas sp. Cr13.

TI  - Influenza A virus elicits peri-vascular adipose tissue inflammation and vascular 
      dysfunction of the aorta in pregnant mice.

AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) infection during pregnancy initiates significant aortic
      endothelial and vascular smooth muscle dysfunction, with inflammation and T cell 
      activation, but the details of the mechanism are yet to be clearly defined. Here 
      we demonstrate that IAV disseminates preferentially into the perivascular adipose
      tissue (PVAT) of the aorta in mice. IAV mRNA levels in the PVAT increased at 1-3 
      days post infection (d.p.i) with the levels being ~4-8 fold higher compared with 
      the vessel wall. IAV infection also increased Ly6Clow patrolling monocytes and
      Ly6Chigh pro-inflammatory monocytes in the vessel wall at 3 d.p.i., which was
      then followed by a greater homing of these monocytes into the PVAT at 6 d.p.i.
      The vascular immune phenotype was characteristic of a "vascular storm"- like
      response, with increases in neutrophils, pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative
      stress markers in the PVAT and arterial wall, which was associated with an
      impairment in endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. IAV also
      triggered a PVAT compartmentalised elevation in CD4+ and CD8+ activated T cells. 
      In conclusion, the PVAT of the aorta is a niche that supports IAV dissemination
      and a site for perpetuating a profound innate inflammatory and adaptive T cell
      response. The manifestation of this inflammatory response in the PVAT following
      IAV infection may be central to the genesis of cardiovascular complications
      arising during pregnancy.

TI  - Effectiveness of exercise intervention during pregnancy on high-risk women for
      gestational diabetes mellitus prevention: A meta-analysis of published RCTs.
PG  - e0272711
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272711 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed at investigating the preventive role of exercise intervention
      during pregnancy, in high-risk women for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, and Scopus for randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated exercise interventions during pregnancy
      on women at high risk for GDM. Data were combined with random effects models.
      Between study heterogeneity (Cochran's Q statistic) and the extent of study
      effects variability [I2 with 95% confidence interval (CI)] were estimated.
      Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of population, intervention, and study
      characteristics. We also evaluated the potential for publication bias. RESULTS:
      Among the 1,508 high-risk women who were analyzed in 9 RCTs, 374 (24.8%) [160
      (21.4%) in intervention, and 214 (28.1%) in control group] developed GDM. Women
      who received exercise intervention during pregnancy were less likely to develop
      GDM compared to those who followed the standard prenatal care (OR 0.70, 95%CI
      0.52, 0.93; P-value 0.02) [Q 10.08, P-value 0.26; I2 21% (95%CI 0, 62%]. Studies 
      with low attrition bias also showed a similar result (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.51, 0.97; 
      P-value 0.03). A protective effect was also supported when analysis was limited
      to studies including women with low education level (OR 0.55; 95%CI 0.40, 0.74;
      P-value 0.0001); studies with exercise intervention duration more than 20 weeks
      (OR 0.54; 95%CI 0.40, 0.74; P-value 0.0007); and studies with a motivation
      component in the intervention (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.50, 0.96; P-value 0.03). We could
      not exclude large variability in study effects because the upper limit of I2
      confidence interval was higher than 50% for all analyses. There was no conclusive
      evidence for small study effects (P-value 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: Our study might
      support a protective effect of exercise intervention during pregnancy for
      high-risk women to prevent GDM. The protective result should be corroborated by
      large, high quality RCTs.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the value of computed tomography-guided percutaneous
      lung biopsy (CT-PLB) combined with rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) in the
      diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs). Methods: A total of 108
      patients who diagnosed with PPLs by chest CT examination were prospectively
      collected and randomly divided into ROSE group (n = 56) and No-ROSE group (n =
      52). Both groups received CT-PLB and pathological examination. The smear
      submitted for ROSE was stained using Diff Quik dye. The accuracy, sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV),
      number of punctures, puncture time and incidence of complications were compared
      between the two groups. Results: The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and
      NPV of the ROSE group were 89.29%, 87.50%, 91.67%, 93.33%, and 84.62%,
      respectively. The number of punctures in the ROSE group was significantly lower
      than that in the No-ROSE group (P < .05). The incidence of pneumothorax and
      hemoptysis in the ROSE group were lower than those in the No-ROSE group, but
      there was no statistical difference between the two groups (P > .05). ROSE has
      good concordance with routine pathological examination in the diagnosis of
      unidentified PPLs (Kappa = 0.786, P < .01). Conclusions: CT-PLB combined with
      ROSE is a safe and effective method for the diagnosis of PPLs.

TI  - Factor associated with anthropometric failure among under-five Bengali children: 
      A comparative study between Bangladesh and India.
PG  - e0272634
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272634 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Child undernutrition is a burden and the leading cause of child
      mortality in low-and middle-income countries like Bangladesh and India.
      Currently, this issue is a matter of great concern, inasmuch as achieving the
      Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study intends to determine the factors 
      of child undernutrition using a single composite index of anthropometric failure 
      (CIAF) among the Bengali population. METHODS: Unit level data on 14055 under 5
      children were extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18
      (BDHS) and the 4th National Family Health Survey of India (NFHS-4). To understand
      child undernutrition and generate CIAF, data on height-for-age (stunting),
      weight-for-height (wasting), and weight-for-age (underweight) were used by WHO
      guidelines. These three undernutrition indicators were combined into a single
      undernutrition indicator called anthropometric failure (anth-failure) using the
      CIAF concept. Explanatory factors of anth-failure included data on maternal
      health, socio-demographic and birth-related variables. Differences of frequency
      were determined by Z-proportional and Chi-square tests; predictors of
      anth-failure were determined by binary logistic regression. Cut off point of
      p-value was taken as 0.05 to test the significance. RESULTS: Inter-country
      disparities were revealed, about half of Bengali children in India and two-fifths
      in Bangladesh being prone to anth-failure. Stunting and underweight were more
      prevalent in both countries than wasting. Maternal undernutrition, lack of
      maternal education, and poor wealth index were common factors of anth-failure for
      both countries. Children in Bangladesh developed anth-failure after the end of
      breastfeeding period, indicating a lack of nutritious food. Lack of antenatal
      care was another significant factor in Bangladesh. In India, the first child
      suffered from anth-failure due to lack of maternal education. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study provides a better understanding of multifactorial impact on child
      undernutrition. It is proposed that the emphasis should be on initiatives that
      improve maternal education and nutrition, child food security, boost household
      wealth index, and enhance mothers' access to health care. The study strongly
      recommends that the governments of Bangladesh and India invest financially in
      preventing child malnutrition, which will contribute to achieving the first four 
      SDGs.

TI  - Comparing the effect of childbirth preparation courses delivered both in-person
      and via social media on pregnancy experience, fear of childbirth, birth
      preference and mode of birth in pregnant Iranian women: A quasi-experimental
      study.
PG  - e0272613
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272613 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Rates of cesarean section in Iran are unnecessarily high
      largely due to fear of childbirth (FOC), yet this may be reduced through
      education. Iranian women are keen to obtain information about pregnancy and birth
      online though sources may not be reliable. Consequently, the present study aimed 
      to compare the effect of childbirth preparation courses delivered both online via
      the social media platform 'Telegram' and in-person on pregnancy experience, FOC, 
      birth preference, and mode of birth. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study
      included 165 primiparous pregnant women referred to the prenatal clinic in
      Tehran, Iran. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants, who were
      subsequently divided into three groups; (A) social media-based educational
      intervention (n = 53); (B) in-person educational intervention (n = 52), and (C) a
      control group who received no prenatal education (n = 50). During the 18th and
      20th weeks of pregnancy, demographic questions along with the pregnancy
      experience scale (PES), and version A of the Wijma delivery expectancy/experience
      questionnaire (WDEQA) were completed. In the 36th and 38th weeks of pregnancy,
      the PES and WDEQA questionnaires, as well as birth preference form were further
      completed. Mode of birth was recorded in the first few days of postpartum. The
      Fisher's exact test, along with ANOVA and Chi-square tests were used to determine
      associations between variables. A paired t-test was used to examine within-group 
      comparisons. The Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used to investigate the
      intervening effect of economic status. RESULTS: Post intervention, the mean score
      of pregnancy experience and FOC did not differ significantly between the three
      groups. Also, 86.8% of participants in group A, 90.4% of participants in group B,
      and 62% of participants in the control group preferred to give birth vaginally,
      which was statistically significant (p = 0.001). Moreover, 66% of participants in
      group A, 61.5% of participants in group B, and 50% of participants in the control
      group ultimately gave birth vaginally. None of the participants in group A
      underwent an elective cesarean section, while this rate was 7.7% and 24% for
      groups B and control, respectively (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Despite the
      non-significant differences identified between the three groups in terms of
      pregnancy experience and FOC, prenatal education delivered via social media may
      be usefully offered to Iranian women keen to receive education flexibly online.

TI  - Patient-reported factors associated with avoidance of in-person care during the
      COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a national survey.
PG  - e0272609
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a substantial decline in in-person care in inpatient
      and outpatient settings during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Avoidance of needed
      in-person care may contribute to an avoidable decline in patient health and an
      increase in mortality. While several systems and behavioral theories have been
      put forward to explain the decline, there is a lack of studies informed by
      patients' own experiences. The current study applied a socio-ecological model
      encompassing patient, environmental, and institutional-related variables to
      examine patient-reported factors associated with avoidance of in-person care.
      METHODS: Between October and December 2020, a total of 3840 persons responded to 
      a nationwide online questionnaire that was administered using ResearchMatch and
      Facebook. Self-reported avoidance of in-person care among those who needed it was
      the main outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify
      factors associated with avoidance of needed care. FINDINGS: Out of a total of
      3372 respondents who reported that they needed in-person care during the early
      phase of the pandemic, 257 (7.6%) avoided it. Patient-related variables
      associated with avoiding needed care included younger age (odds ratio (OR), 1.46,
      95% CI 1.11 to 1.94, p<0.01; <45 y/o vs 45+), inability to afford care (OR =
      1.65, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.34, p<0.01), and greater COVID-related stress (OR = 1.36, 
      CI 1.01 to 1.83, p<0.05). More frequent discussions about COVID with family and
      friends was the only significant environment-related avoidance of care variable
      (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.01-1.91, p < .05). Institution-related care avoidance
      variables included a negative patient healthcare experience rating (OR 1.83, 95% 
      CI 1.38 to 2.42, p<0.001), poor awareness of the institution's safety protocol
      (OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.51, p<0.01), and low ratings of the institution's
      effectiveness in communicating their safety protocol (OR = 3.45, 95% CI 1.94 to
      6.12, p<0.001). The final model predicted 11.9% of the variance in care
      avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that care avoidance of in-person
      care during the initial phase of the pandemic was influenced by a patient's
      demographics as well as environmental and healthcare institutional factors.
      Patients' previous experiences and their awareness of healthcare systems' safety 
      protocols are important factors in care avoidance.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272369 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze ocular biometric changes following unilateral cataract
      surgery in children. METHODS: A total of 57 children aged under 13 years who
      underwent unilateral cataract surgery were analyzed. Groups were classified
      according to their age at surgery: group I (age <3), II (3</= age <6), III (6</= 
      age <9), and IV (age >/=9). The myopic shift, axial growth, and corneal curvature
      changes were compared between the pseudophakic eyes and the fellow phakic eyes.
      RESULTS: During 7.81 +/- 4.39 years, the overall myopic shift (D) and the rate of
      myopic shift (D/year) were significantly higher at -3.25 +/- 3.21 D and -0.45 +/-
      0.44 D/year in the pseudophakic eyes than -1.78 +/- 2.10 D and -0.22 +/- 0.29
      D/year in the fellow phakic eyes (P = 0.01, 0.004). Group I (-1.14 +/- 0.66 vs
      -0.02 +/- 0.45 D/year) and group II (-0.63 +/- 0.37 vs -0.31 +/- 0.29 D/year)
      showed significantly higher rate of myopic shift in the pseudophakic eyes than in
      the phakic eyes. The rate of myopic shift in the pseudophakic eyes decreased in
      the older age groups (P = 0.001). There was no significant between-eye difference
      in the changes in axial length and keratometric values postoperatively.
      CONCLUSION: Following unilateral cataract surgery, a significant postoperative
      myopic shift was noticed in the pseudophakic eyes compared to the fellow phakic
      eyes in groups under 6 years old. Postoperative myopic shift and the resultant
      anisometropia should be considered when selecting the optimal power of IOL in
      young children requiring unilateral cataract surgery.

AB  - High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing has become an increasing
      important strategy in primary cervical cancer screening in recent years. It
      warrants the evaluation of molecular-based HPV tests for accuracy and efficacy of
      screening. The performance of Roche Cobas 4800 HPV test was validated and
      compared with Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) high-risk HPV DNA test for primary
      screening in a large Chinese screening cohort. Of 6345 women screened, overall
      agreement between Cobas and HC2 was 92.23% (95% CI: 91.57-92.89). The inter-assay
      agreement was correlated with the severity of underlying biology, with an
      increasing concordance found in samples with more severe abnormalities. Most of
      the discordant samples had the test signal strength closer to the test limits of 
      the detection than concordant samples, reflecting a low viral load and infection 
      of a cluster of low-risk HPV in these samples. The Cobas test demonstrated
      significantly higher specificity in identifying CIN2+/CIN3+ cases than HC2 test
      (66.46% vs 43.67% and 65.42% vs 42.86%, p<0.001), with comparable sensitivity in 
      clinical evaluation. Increased specificity of Cobas test would accent women
      having the highest risk of developing CIN2+, with the potential to reduce
      unnecessary colposcopy referral in a screening population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: With fragile health care systems, sub-Saharan Africa countries like
      Ethiopia are facing a complex epidemic, and become difficult to control the noble
      coronavirus. The use of COVID-19 preventive measures is strongly recommended.
      This study aimed to assess the adherence of COVID-19 mitigation measures and
      associated factors among health care workers. METHODS: A facility-based
      cross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers at referral
      hospitals in the Amhara regional state of Ethiopia from May 15 to June 10; 2021. 
      It was a web-based study using an online questionnaire. STATA 14.2 was used for
      data analysis. Variables with a p-value<0.05 at 95% confidence level in
      multivariable analysis were declared as statistically significant using binary
      logistic regression. RESULT: Adherence to COVID-19 mitigation measures was 50.24%
      in the current study. The odd of adherence of participants with a monthly income 
      of >/=12801birr was 15% whereas the odds of adherence of participants who
      hesitate to take the COVID 19 vaccine were 10% as compared to those who don't
      hesitate. Participants who had undergone COVID-19 tests adhered 6.64 times more
      than their counterparts. Those who believe adequate measurements are taken by the
      government adhered 4.6 times more than those who believe not adequate.
      Participants who believe as no risk of severe disease adhered 16% compared to
      those with fear of severe disease. Presence of households aged >60years adhered
      about 7.9 times more than with no households aged>60. Participants suspected of
      COVID-19 diagnosis adhered 5.7 times more than those not suspected. CONCLUSION:
      In this study, a significant proportion of healthcare workers did not adhere to
      COVID-19 mitigation measures. Hence, giving special attention to healthcare
      workers with a monthly income of >/=12801 birr, being hesitant towards COVID-19
      vaccine, being aged 26-30, and perceiving no risk of developing a severe
      infection is crucial to reduce non-adherence.

      microbiome, and metabolites in lambs.
PG  - e0272310

AB  - Antibiotics were once used in animal production to improve productivity and
      resistance to pathogenic microbiota. However, due to its negative effects, the
      search for a new class of substances that can replace its efficacy has become one
      of the urgent problems to be solved. Plant essential oils (EOs) as a natural feed
      additive can maintain microbiota homeostasis and improve animal performance.
      However, its specific mechanism of action needs to be further investigated.
      Therefore, we added different doses of essential oil of Zanthoxylum bungeanum
      (EOZB) to the diets of Small Tail Han Sheep hybrid male lambs (STH lambs) to
      evaluate the effect of EOZB on rumen enzyme activity, rumen microbiology, and its
      metabolites in STH lambs. Twenty STH lambs were randomly divided into four groups
      (n = 5/group) and provided with the same diet. The dietary treatments were as
      follows: basal diet (BD) group; BD+EOZB 5 ml/kg group; BD+EOZB 10 ml/kg group;
      BD+EOZB 15 ml/kg group. We found that EOZB 10 ml/kg helped to increase rumen
      pectinase (P<0.05) and lipase (P<0.05) activities. Microbial 16S rRNA gene
      analysis showed that EOZB significantly altered the abundance of rumen microbiota
      (P<0.05). LC/GC-MS metabolomic analysis showed that the addition of EOZB produced
      a total of 1073 differential metabolites, with 58 differential metabolites
      remaining after raising the screening criteria. These differential metabolites
      were mainly enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, choline metabolism in
      cancer, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, and
      protein digestion and absorption. Correlation analysis showed that some rumen
      microbiota were significantly correlated with differential metabolite and enzyme 
      activities.

AB  - PURPOSE: Beliefs that the risks from a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh the risks from
      getting COVID-19 and concerns that the vaccine development process was rushed and
      lacking rigor have been identified as important drivers of hesitancy and refusal 
      to get a COVID-19 vaccine. We tested whether messages designed to address these
      beliefs and concerns might promote intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine. METHOD: 
      We conducted an online survey fielded between March 8-23, 2021 with US Veteran (n
      = 688) and non-Veteran (n = 387) respondents. In a between-subjects experiment,
      respondents were randomly assigned to a control group (with no message) or to
      read one of two intervention messages: 1. a fact-box styled message comparing the
      risks of getting COVID-19 compared to the vaccine, and 2. a timeline styled
      message describing the development process of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.
      RESULTS: Most respondents (60%) wanted a COVID-19 vaccine. However, 17% expressed
      hesitancy and 23% did not want to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The fact-box styled
      message and the timeline message did not significantly improve vaccination
      intentions, F(2,358) = 0.86, p = .425, [Formula: see text] = .005, or reduce the 
      time respondents wanted to wait before getting vaccinated, F(2,306) = 0.79, p =
      .453, [Formula: see text] = .005, compared to no messages. DISCUSSION: In this
      experimental study, we did not find that providing messages about vaccine risks
      and the development process had an impact on respondents' vaccine intentions.
      Further research is needed to identify how to effectively address concerns about 
      the risks associated with COVID-19 vaccines and the development process and to
      understand additional factors that influence vaccine intentions.

AB  - In this study, we sequenced a bacteria isolate Pandoraea sp. 892iso isolated from
      a Phytophthora rubi strain which is an important plant pathogenic oomycete,
      identified through genome and combined the data with existing genomic data from
      other 28 the genus of Pandoraea species. Next, we conducted a comparative genomic
      analysis of the genome structure, evolutionary relationships, and pathogenic
      characteristics of Pandoraea species. Our results identified Pandoraea sp. 892iso
      as Pandoraea sputorum at both the genome and gene levels. At the genome level, we
      carried out phylogenetic analysis of single-copy, gene co-linearity, ANI (average
      nucleotide identity) and AAI (average amino acid identity) indices, rpoB
      similarity, MLSA phylogenetic analysis, and genome-to-genome distance calculator 
      calculations to identify the relationship between Pandoraea sp. 892iso and P.
      sputorum. At the gene level, the quorum sensing genes ppnI and ppnR and the
      OXA-159 gene were assessed. It is speculated that Pandoraea sp. 892iso is the
      endosymbiont of the Oomycetes strain of Phytophthora rubi.

TI  - Manipulation of the MoO2/MoSe2 Heterointerface Boosting High Rate and Durability 
      for Sodium/Potassium Storage.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c08080 [doi]
AB  - The main challenge for sodium/potassium ion storage is to find the suitable host 
      materials to accommodate the larger-sized Na(+)/K(+) and conquer the sluggish
      chemical kinetics. Herein, by selenation of polyoxometalate in electrospinning
      fiber, a novel MoO2/MoSe2 heterostructure embedded in one-dimensional (1D)
      N,P-doped carbon nanofiber (MoO2/MoSe2@NPC) is rationally constructed to show
      distinct enhancement of rate performance and cycle life for sodium ion batteries 
      (SIBs) and potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The 1D skeleton of MoO2/MoSe2@NPC
      decreases the diffusion pathway of Na(+)/K(+), and the doping of N/P heteroatoms 
      in carbon fiber creates abundant active sites and provides good reachability for 
      Na(+)/K(+) transportation. MoSe2 nanosheets grow in the bulk phase of MoO2 via in
      situ local phase transformation to achieve effective and firm heterointerfaces.
      Especially, the exposure extent of heterointerfaces can be controlled by
      treatment temperature during the preparation process, and the optimized
      heterointerfaces result in an ideal synergic effect between MoO2 and MoSe2. DFT
      calculations confirm that the internal electric field in the heterogeneous
      interface guides the electron transfer from MoO2 to MoSe2, combined with strong
      adsorption capacity toward sodium/potassium, facilitating ion/electron transfer
      kinetics. It is confirmed that the MoO2/MoSe2@NPC anode for SIBs delivers 382 mA 
      h g(-1) under 0.1 A g(-1) upon 200 cycles; meanwhile, a reversible capacity of
      266 mA h g(-1) is maintained even under 2 A g(-1) after 2000 cycles. For PIBs, it
      can reach up to 216 mA h g(-1) in the 200th cycle and still retain 125 mA h g(-1)
      after 2000 cycles under 1 A g(-1). This study opens up a new interface
      manipulation strategy for the design of anode materials to boost fast Na(+)/K(+) 
      storage kinetics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the survival and complications of neoadjuvant
      chemoradiation (NCRT) versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) for esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature
      search of the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, Wanfang
      Data, CBM, and VIP databases from inception to November 2021. Meta-analyses were 
      performed using RevMan (version 5.3) and Stata version 15.0. RESULTS: A total of 
      18 studies were included, which involved 3137 patients, The results of the
      metaanalysis showed that the pathological complete remission rate (odds ratio
      [OR] = 5.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.85-9.50, p<0.00001) and complete
      tumor resection rate (OR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.57-3.41, p<0.0001) in the NCRT group
      were significantly better than those in the NCT group. Our meta-analysis results 
      showed that 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates (1-year overall survival [OS]: OR =
      1.51, 95% CI: 1.11-2.05, p = 0.009; 3-year OS: OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.36-2.21,
      p<0.0001; 5-year OS: OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.30-1.99, p<0.00001) in the NCRT group
      were significantly higher than those in the NCT group. NCRT can lead a
      significant survival benefit compared with NCT and there was no significant
      difference between the two neoadjuvant treatments in terms of postoperative
      complications. CONCLUSION: The use of NCRT in the treatment of patients with ESCC
      patients showed significant advantages in terms of survival and safety relative
      to the use of NCT.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary
      hypertension. The diagnosis of PA currently requires multiple complicated
      measures. The aims of this study were to identify easy-to-obtain clinical and
      biochemical predictors, and to create predictive model to facilitate the
      identification of a patient at high risk of having PA. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      This 2-year retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care medical
      center. A total of 305 patients who had been tested for plasma aldosterone
      concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were identified. Patients
      with incomplete results of PAC and PRA and those who had an established diagnosis
      of Cushing's syndrome or pheochromocytoma were excluded. Logistic regression
      analysis was used to identify significant predictors and to create predictive
      model of PA. RESULTS: PA was diagnosed in 128 of the patients (41.96%).
      Significant predictive factors for PA were age >60 years (OR 2.12, p = 0.045),
      female (OR 1.65, p<0.001), smoking (OR 2.79, p<0.001), coronary artery disease
      (OR 2.29, p<0.001), obstructive sleep apnea (OR 1.50, p = 0.017), systolic blood 
      pressure >160 mmHg (OR 1.15, P<0.001), serum potassium <3 mEq/L (OR 3.72, p =
      0.030), fasting blood glucose >126 mg/dL (OR 0.48, p = 0.001) and estimated
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (OR 1.79, p = 0.001).
      Predictive model was created with a total score ranged from 0 to 42. A score
      above 7.5 indicated a higher probability of having PA with a sensitivity of 72%
      and a specificity of 70%. The diagnostic performance of the predictive model
      based on area under the curve was 71%. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and biochemical 
      predictive factors including predictive model identified in this study can be
      employed as an additional tool to help identify patients at risk of having PA and
      could help reduce the number of screening and confirmation tests required for PA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumothorax has been increasingly observed among patients with
      coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, specifically in those patients who
      develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this study, we sought to
      determine the incidence and potential risk factors of pneumothorax in critically 
      ill adults with COVID-19. METHOD: This retrospective cohort study included adult 
      patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to one of the
      adult intensive care units of a tertiary, academic teaching hospital from May
      2020 through May 2021. RESULTS: Among 334 COVID-19 cases requiring ICU admission,
      the incidence of pneumothorax was 10% (33 patients). Patients who experienced
      pneumothorax more frequently required vasopressor support (28/33 [84%] vs.
      191/301 [63%] P = 0.04), were more likely to be proned (25/33 [75%] vs. 111/301
      [36%], P<0.001), and the presence of pneumothorax was associated with prolonged
      duration of mechanical ventilation; 21 (1-97) versus 7 (1-79) days, p<0.001 as
      well as prolonged hospital length of stay (29 [9-133] vs. 15 [1-90] days,
      P<0.001), but mortality was not significantly different between groups.
      Importantly, when we performed a Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) model of
      multivariate parameters, we found that administration of tocilizumab
      significantly increased the risk of developing pneumothorax (HR = 10.7; CI
      [3.6-32], P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Among 334 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 
      the incidence of pneumothorax was 10%. Presence of pneumothorax was associated
      with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay.
      Strikingly, receipt of tocilizumab was associated with an increased risk of
      developing pneumothorax.

TI  - Online searches of children's oseltamivir in public primary and specialized care:
      Detecting influenza outbreaks in Finland using dedicated databases for health
      care professionals.
PG  - e0272040
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272040 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health care professionals working in primary and specialized care
      typically search for medical information from Internet sources. In Finland,
      Physician's Databases are online portals aimed at professionals seeking medical
      information. As dosage errors may occur when prescribing medication to children, 
      professionals' need for reliable medical information has increased in public
      health care centers and hospitals. Influenza continues to be a public health
      threat, with young children at risk of developing severe illness and easily
      transmitting the virus. Oseltamivir is used to treat children with influenza. The
      objective of this study was to compare searches for children's oseltamivir and
      influenza diagnoses in primary and specialized care, and to determine if the
      searches could aid detection of influenza outbreaks. METHODS: We compared
      searches in Physician's Databases for children's oral suspension of oseltamivir
      (6 mg/mL) for influenza diagnoses of children under 7 years and laboratory
      findings of influenza A and B from the National Infectious Disease Register.
      Searches and diagnoses were assessed in primary and specialized care across
      Finland by season from 2012-2016. The Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) calculated
      seasonal starts and ends, and paired differences in the mean compared two
      indicators. Correlation was tested to compare seasons. RESULTS: We found that
      searches and diagnoses in primary and specialized care showed visually similar
      patterns annually. The MEM-calculated starting weeks in searches appeared mainly 
      in the same week. Oseltamivir searches in primary care preceded diagnoses by -1.0
      weeks (95% CI: -3.0, -0.3; p = 0.132) with very high correlation (tau = 0.913).
      Specialized care oseltamivir searches and diagnoses correlated moderately (tau = 
      0.667). CONCLUSION: Health care professionals' searches for children's
      oseltamivir in online databases linked with the registers of children's influenza
      diagnoses in primary and specialized care. Therefore, database searches should be
      considered as supplementary information in disease surveillance when detecting
      influenza epidemics.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268712 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Available but insufficient evidence shows that changes may occur in the 
      immune system following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present study
      aimed at evaluating immunological changes in patients with severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia compared with the
      control group. METHOD: The present study was performed on 95 patients with
      COVID-19 (32 severe and 63 moderate cases) and 22 healthy controls. Relationship 
      between immune cells, disease severity and lung involvement was assessed. Binary 
      logistic regression and ROC curve tests were used for statistical analysis.
      RESULTS: A significant decrease was observed in CD20+ cell counts of the
      patients. To differentiate patients from healthy individuals, the cutoff point
      for the CD4+ cell count was 688 /muL, sensitivity 0.96, and specificity 0.84. An 
      increase in CD4+ cells reduces the odds of severe disease (odds ratio = 0.82, P =
      0.047) and death (odds ratio = 0.74, P = 0.029). CD4+ cells play a pivotal role
      in the severity of lung involvement (P = 0.03). In addition to CD4+ cells, Fc
      gamma receptor III (FcgammaRIII) (CD16) also played a significant prognosis (odds
      ratio = 0.55, P = 0.047). In severe cases, C-reactive protein, Blood urea
      nitrogen, and Creatine phosphokinase levels, as well as neutrophil counts, were
      significantly higher than those of moderate ones whereas lymphocyte count in
      severe cases was lower than that of moderate ones. CONCLUSION: The number of
      total T-cells and B-cells in patients with COVID-19 was lower than that of
      controls; however, their NK cells increased. FcgammaRIII and CD4+ cells are of
      great importance due to their association with COVID-19 prognosis.

PG  - e0272149
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272149 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this meta-analysis study, the main objective was to determine the 
      accuracy of S-detect in effectively distinguishing malignant thyroid nodules from
      benign thyroid nodules. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and
      CBM databases from inception to August 1, 2021. Meta-analysis was conducted using
      STATA version 14.0 and Meta-Disc version 1.4 softwares. We calculated summary
      statistics for sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), positive and negative
      likelihood ratio (LR+/LR-), diagnostic odds ratio(DOR), and receiver operating
      characteristic (SROC) curves. Cochran's Q-statistic and I2 test were used to
      evaluate potential heterogeneity between studies. A sensitivity analysis was
      performed to evaluate the influence of single studies on the overall estimate. We
      also performed meta-regression analyses to investigate the potential sources of
      heterogeneity. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 17 studies meeting the
      requirements of the standard were used. The number of benign and malignant
      nodules analyzed and evaluated in this paper was 1595 and 1118 respectively. This
      paper mainly completes the required histological confirmation through s-detect.
      The pooled Sen and pooled Spe were 0.87 and 0.74, respectively, (95%CI =
      0.84-0.89) and (95%CI = 0.66-0.81). Furthermore, the pooled LR+ and negative LR- 
      were determined to be 3.37 (95%CI = 2.53-4.50) and 0.18 (95%CI = 0.15-0.21),
      respectively. The experimental results showed that the pooled DOR of thyroid
      nodules was 18.83 (95% CI = 13.21-26.84). In addition, area under SROC curve was 
      determined to be 0.89 (SE = 0.0124). It should be pointed out that there is no
      evidence of bias (i.e. t = 0.25, P = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: Through this
      meta-analysis, it can be seen that the accuracy of s-detect is relatively high
      for the effective distinction between malignant thyroid nodules and benign
      thyroid nodules.

TI  - Near-infrared spectroscopy estimation of combined skeletal muscle oxidative
      capacity and O2 diffusion capacity in humans.
LID - 10.1113/JP283267 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: We determined post-exercise recovery kinetics of quadriceps muscle
      oxygen uptake (mVO2 ) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in humans
      under conditions of both non-limiting (HIGH) and limiting (LOW) O2 availability, 
      for comparison with biopsy variables. The mVO2 recovery rate constant in HIGH O2 
      availability was hypothesized to reflect muscle oxidative capacity (kHIGH ); and 
      the difference in k between HIGH and LOW O2 availability (k) was hypothesized to 
      reflect muscle O2 diffusing capacity. kHIGH was correlated with phosphorylating
      oxidative capacity of permeabilized muscle fiber bundles (r = 0.80). k was
      negatively correlated with capillary density (r = -0.68) of biopsy samples. NIRS 
      provides non-invasive means of assessing both muscle oxidative and oxygen
      diffusing capacity in vivo. ABSTRACT: The final steps of the O2 cascade during
      exercise depend on the product of the microvascular-to-intramyocyte PO2
      difference and muscle O2 diffusing capacity (DmO2 ). Non-invasive methods to
      determine DmO2 in humans are currently unavailable. Muscle oxygen uptake (mVO2 ) 
      recovery rate constant (k), measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) using
      intermittent arterial occlusions, is associated with muscle oxidative capacity in
      vivo. We reasoned that k would be limited by DmO2 when muscle oxygenation is low 
      (kLOW ), and hypothesized that: i) k in well-oxygenated muscle (kHIGH ) is
      associated with maximal O2 flux in fiber bundles; and ii) k (kHIGH -kLOW ) is
      associated with capillary density (CD). Vastus lateralis k was measured in 12
      participants using NIRS after moderate exercise. The timing and duration of
      arterial occlusions were manipulated to maintain tissue saturation index (TSI)
      within a 10% range either below (LOW) or above (HIGH) half-maximal desaturation, 
      assessed during sustained arterial occlusion. Maximal O2 flux in phosphorylating 
      state was 37.7+/-10.6 pmol.s(-1) .mg(-1) ( approximately 5.8 ml.min(-1) .100g(-1)
      ). CD ranged 348 to 586 mm(-2) . kHIGH was greater than kLOW (3.15+/-0.45 vs
      1.56+/-0.79 min(-1) , p<0.001). Maximal O2 flux was correlated with kHIGH (r =
      0.80, p = 0.002) but not kLOW (r = -0.10, p = 0.755). Deltak ranged -0.26 to
      -2.55 min(-1) , and correlated with CD (r = -0.68, p = 0.015). mVO2 k reflects
      muscle oxidative capacity only in well-oxygenated muscle. k, the difference in k 
      between well- and poorly-oxygenated muscle, was associated with CD, a mediator of
      DmO2 . Assessment of muscle k and k using NIRS provides a non-invasive window on 
      muscle oxidative and O2 diffusing capacity. Abstract figure legend NIRS probe was
      positioned on vastus lateralis muscle and used to assess both muscle oxidative
      and oxygen diffusing capacity in vivo by intermittent arterial occlusions. Timing
      and duration of each occlusion were manipulated to maintain tissue saturation

LID - 10.1111/idh.12612 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the common practices of dental implant maintenance among
      dental hygiene professionals (DHP) in Israel (IL) and Germany (GE). METHODS: An
      online questionnaire was developed by the Periodontology Departments of Tel Aviv 
      (IL) and Frankfurt University (GE) to address demographics, training, prevention,
      and treatment of peri-implant diseases. The questionnaire was distributed by DHP 
      associations via social media. RESULTS: The responses of 376 DHPs (IL: 169; GE:
      207) were analyzed. Most participants were female (IL: 168/99%; GE: 203/98%), had
      received education (IL: 179/97%; GE: 207/97%), and were working in their home
      countries (IL: 182/99%; GE: 211/99%). Peri-implant probing was not performed by
      22% of DHPs in IL and 5% in GE. Of the DHPs who used probes, 49% used metal
      probes in IL, while 40% used plastic probes in GE (p < 0.001). A majority of DHPs
      performed peri-implant instrumentation (IL: 168/99%; GE: 190/92%). Most DHPs from
      IL did not use devices other than hand and/or sonic/ultrasonic instruments for
      peri-implant cleaning (IL: 130/77%; GE 5/2%); in GE, the use of airflow (IL:
      31/18%; GE: 199/96%) is popular (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most DHPs in IL and GE 
      perform peri-implant probing and debridement. However, there are some distinct
      differences between the two countries regarding the choice of instruments and
      treatment regimens.

TI  - A Simultaneous Gesture Classification and Force Estimation Strategy Based on
      Wearable A-mode Ultrasound and Cascade Model.
LID - 10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3196926 [doi]
AB  - The existing Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) based on gesture recognition using
      surface electromyography (sEMG) have made significant progress. However, the sEMG
      has inherent limitations as well as the gesture classification and force
      estimation have not been effectively combined. There are limitations in
      applications such as prosthetic control and clinical rehabilitation, etc. In this
      paper, a grasping gesture and force recognition strategy based on wearable A-mode
      ultrasound and two-stage cascade model is proposed, which can simultaneously
      estimate the force while classifying the grasping gesture. This paper experiments
      five grasping gestures and four force levels (5-50%MVC). The results demonstrate 
      that the performance of the proposed model is significantly better than that of
      the traditional model both in classification and regression (p<0.001).
      Additionally, the two-stage cascade regression model (TSCRM) used the Gaussian
      Process regression model (GPR) with the mean and standard deviation (MSD) feature
      obtains excellent results, with normalized root-mean-square error (nRMSE) and
      correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.1049+/-0.0374 and 0.9461+/-0.0354,
      respectively. Besides, the latency of the model meets the requirement of
      real-time recognition (T<15ms). Therefore, the research outcomes prove the
      feasibility of the proposed recognition strategy and provide a reference for the 
      field of prosthetic control, etc.

TI  - Decomposition model of hybrid variation-sparse representation for medical image
      fusion and denoising.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2022.3196710 [doi]
AB  - Medical image fusion technology integrates the contents of medical images of
      different modalities, thereby assisting users of medical images to better
      understand their meaning. However, the fusion of medical images corrupted by
      noise remains a challenge. To solve the existing problems in medical image fusion
      and denoising algorithms related to excessive blur, unclean denoising, gradient
      information loss, and color distortion, a novel medical image fusion and
      denoising algorithm is proposed. First, a new image layer decomposition model
      based on hybrid variation-sparse representation and weighted Schatten p-norm is
      proposed. The alternating direction method of multipliers is used to update the
      structure, detail layer dictionary, and detail layer coefficient map of the input
      image while denoising. Subsequently, appropriate fusion rules are employed for
      the structure layers and detail layer coefficient maps. Finally, the fused image 
      is restored using the fused structure layer, detail layer dictionary, and detail 
      layer coefficient maps. A large number of experiments confirm the superiority of 
      the proposed algorithm over other algorithms. The proposed medical image fusion
      and denoising algorithm can effectively remove noise while retaining the gradient
      information without color distortion.

TI  - The use of the normal tissue non-complication probability (NTCP0) in the safety
      evaluations as a new alternative of assessing the side-effects of the radiation
      oncology treatments.
PG  - 1-21
LID - 10.1080/09553002.2022.2110299 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To encourage the use of the NTCP0 for evaluating safety as a new
      alternative of assessing the S-Es of the radiation oncology treatments; and the
      use of the "NTCP0cal" methodology that calculates/estimates NTCP0. METHOD:
      Revisions of studies related to use of the NTCP in the evaluations of S-Es.
      Development of the first version of the Matlab application of our methodology,
      which provides three options, two of them employ the well-known aspects of a
      phenomenological model, or the relationship with the TNTCP; where NTCP0 =
      100%-TNTCP; and the third option determines NTCP0 from an assumed NTCP discrete
      probabilistic distribution from the binomial distribution, where one of its
      parameters is automatically defined from a databased of the Disease locations Vs.
      Late complications. RESULT: As result of revisions of some QUANTEC studies, we
      can say that: 1) The majority of current NTCP models are DVH-based; 2) The risk
      of toxicity is the way of evaluating the S-Es of the radiation oncology
      treatments; and 3) The NTCP are used mainly for evaluations of individual or
      principal complications or Endpoints of the radiation treatments. The "NTCP0cal" 
      Matlab application developed in this study has three calculation options. Two of 
      the options provide additional graphical information about the distributions.
      CONCLUSIONS: The NTCP0 is a new radiobiological concept, its introduction let to 
      correct some current P + and UTCP formulations, and will allow evaluating S-Es in
      whatever activity involving ionizing radiation, like radiation treatments; and
      its phenomenological model function of dose prescribed (D = n*d) will allow
      calculating values of NTCP0 for a range of dose per fraction (d) in a treatment
      with a determined number of fractions (n), or for range of n for a constant d.
      The DVH is irrelevant for this model. For whatever radiation treatment given to a
      population of similar patients under similar circumstances, the NTCP0 is
      calculated as ratio of the number of patients without acute/late complications
      and total of them. When this number is unknown, then NTCP0 can be obtained using 
      the "NTCP0cal" application.

TI  - Can ultrasound help to overcome uncertainty in clinical joint assessment in
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis?
LID - 10.55563/clinexprheumatol/5lk4x2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Assessment of active synovitis is crucial for the management of
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). We aimed to investigate the correlation of
      musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) and clinical examination results and relate
      them to arthritis relapse rate. METHODS: JIA patients with questionable presence 
      of active arthritis (Q-joints) and controls (JIA and healthy children) were
      recruited. MSUS of Q-joints, active joints and their inactive counterparts was
      performed at study entry. Standard disease activity parameters were prospectively
      recorded. RESULTS: Of 481 joints of 138 JIA patients, 99 joints (20.6%) of 58
      patients had one or more Q-joints with 54/99 (54.5%) having MSUS features of
      active disease. Clinically inactive joints had lower proportion of MSUS synovitis
      (78/253, 30.8%) while MSUS activity was present in 114/129 (88.4%) of clinically 
      active joints and in 2/105 (1.9%) joints of 36 healthy controls. Within the
      15-month follow-up 23/99 (22%) Q-joints and 31/253 (12%) clinically inactive
      joints relapsed. Joints with subclinical synovitis relapsed more frequently than 
      MSUS inactive ones (p<0.001). The relapse rate was higher in MSUS-active Q-joints
      (19/23, 82%) than in clinically inactive ones (16/31, 52%) with MSUS synovial
      hypertrophy as the main relapse predictor in multivariate analysis. Ankle and
      knee joints relapsed most frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledgement of joints with
      questionable synovitis may contribute to the assessment of disease activity in
      JIA. Presence of MSUS synovitis carries a clinically meaningful risk of disease
      recurrence in these joints. In clinical practice, our findings encourage timely
      MSUS assessment of the joints in question, especially in patients without any
      other features of active disease.

      antioxidant (catalase; CAT), in blood samples of individuals chronically exposed 
      to high indoor radon concentrations in Indonesia (Tande-Tande sub-village,
      Mamuju, West Sulawesi). Moreover, we also investigated the occurrence of a
      radio-adaptive response (RAR) in Tande-Tande sub-village inhabitants using the G2
      MN assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The frequencies of dicentric (DC), acentric
      (AF), ring (R) and translocation (Tr) chromosomes in Tande-Tande inhabitants were
      compared to those in people living in a reference area with low levels of indoor 
      radon levels (Topoyo village, Indonesia). The number of MN per 1000 binucleated
      cells (BNC) and CAT concentration per total protein were quantified and compared 
      between groups. Lastly, we irradiated (2 Gy) phytohemagglutinin-stimulated
      samples in vitro and measured the frequency of MN to verify the occurrence of a
      RAR in Tande-Tande sub-village inhabitants. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The
      frequencies of DC, AF and Tr did not differ between Tande-Tande inhabitants and
      control subjects (p = 0.350, 0.521, 0.597). The frequency of MN in Tande-Tande
      inhabitants was significantly lower than that in the control group (p = 0.006).
      Similarly, CAT concentration in Tande-Tande inhabitants was also significantly
      lower than that in the control population (p < 0.001). Significant negative
      correlations were identified for MN number and CAT concentration versus indoor
      radon concentration, annual effective dose, or cumulative dose both within groups
      and when all data were analyzed together. Our findings indicate that, despite the
      high indoor radon levels, Tande-Tande inhabitants are not under oxidative stress,
      since this group had lower CAT concentration and MN frequency than those in the
      control group. The negative correlation between MN frequency and indoor radon
      concentration, annual effective dose, and cumulative dose suggests the occurrence
      of a radio-adaptive response (RAR) phenomenon in Tande-Tande sub-village
      inhabitants. This interpretation is also supported by the results of the G2 MN
      assay, which revealed lower MN frequencies after in vitro irradiation of samples 
      from Tande-Tande sub-village inhabitants than those in samples from the control
      group (p = 0.0069, for cumulative MN frequency; p=0.0146, for radiation-induced
      MN only).

TI  - Predictors of disease activity in gout: a 12-month analysis of the ATTACk
      (Achieving improvement in the management of crystal-induced arthritis)
      multicentre cohort study.
LID - 10.55563/clinexprheumatol/eh0jcp [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gout treatment is largely suboptimal in clinical practice. We aimed
      to assess the predictors of disease-activity at 12 months in a real-life setting.
      METHODS: Consecutive patients referred to Rheumatology Units for suspected acute 
      crystal-induced arthritis were enrolled in a multicentre-cohort study. Only
      patients with clinical diagnosis of gout were eligible. Disease-activity was
      evaluated by the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) on a visual analogue
      scale (VAS, 0=unsatisfactory, 100=satisfactory) at 0 (T0) and 12 months (T12),
      and the composite score called Gout Activity Score (GAS) calculated on the number
      of arthritic attacks (flare count), serum uric acid (sUA), cumulative number of
      tophi, VAS (T12), PtGA (T12). Multivariate linear regression model was performed 
      to assess predictors of gout disease-activity at T12 with PASS and GAS as
      outcomes. RESULTS: 201 patients had gout (diagnosis on synovial fluid in 45%,
      tophi in 26%, mean sUA 7.4+/-1.9 mg/L, 85% with urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in
      progress/initiated at T0); mean age 63+/-13 years, 88% men, median (interquartile
      range) disease duration 2.9 years (0.7-9.4). Follow-up visits were performed in
      113 (56%) patients at T12. Mean PASS observed at T0 and at T12 were 38+/-27 and
      74+/-23, respectively, whereas GAS at T12 was 10+/-8. A significant association
      was observed between the presence of tophi and PASS at T12 (-15.3, 95% CI -25.5, 
      -5.2; p=0.003) and GAS at T12 (+4.0, 95% CI 0.6,7.4; p=0.02), adjusted for age,
      sex, disease duration, sUA <6 mg/dL, tender joint count, PASS at T0, ULT).
      CONCLUSIONS: The baseline presence of tophi may predict high disease-activity at 
      T12, thus worsening GAS and patients' pain perception.

TI  - Airway acidification impaired host defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      infection by promoting type 1 interferon beta response.
PG  - 1-37
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2022.2110524 [doi]
AB  - AbstractAirway microenvironment played an important role in the progression of
      chronic respiratory disease. Here we showed that standardized pondus hydrogenii
      (pH) of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of bronchiectasis patients was
      significantly lower than that of controls and was significantly correlated with
      bronchiectasis severity index (BSI) scores and disease prognosis. EBC pH was
      lower in severe patients than that in mild and moderate patients. Besides, acidic
      microenvironment deteriorated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) pulmonary
      infection in mice models. Mechanistically, acidic microenvironment increased P.
      aeruginosa outer membrane vesicles (PA_OMVs) release and boosted it induced the
      activation of interferon regulatory factor3 (IRF3)-interferonbeta (IFN-beta)
      signaling pathway, ultimately compromised the anti-bacteria immunity. Targeted
      knockout of IRF3 or type 1 interferon receptor (IFNAR1) alleviated lung damage
      and lethality of mice after P. aeruginosa infection that aggravated by acidic
      microenvironment. Together, these findings identified airway acidification
      impaired host resistance to P. aeruginosa infection by enhancing its induced the 
      activation of IRF3-IFN-beta signaling pathway. Standardized EBC pH may be a
      useful biomarker of disease severity and a potential therapeutic target for the
      refractory P. aeruginosa infection. The study also provided one more reference
      parameter for drug selection and new drug discovery for bronchiectasis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate change in health behaviors and anxiety one year after
      the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: University students (n = 525)
      and faculty/staff (n = 136) surveyed in February-April 2021. METHODS:
      Cross-sectional survey on health behaviors and anxiety before and during the
      pandemic. Comparison by time and between groups using paired t-tests and
      chi-square tests. RESULTS: Diet quality of students did not differ comparing
      before to during the pandemic while diet quality improved among faculty/staff (p 
      = 0.001). Physical activity decreased among students (p < 0.0001). Sedentary time
      and prevalence of symptomatic anxiety increased among both students and
      faculty/staff (all p < 0.05). Unhealthy changes in lifestyle and anxiety were
      more pronounced among those who reported a less healthy diet or weight gain
      during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on
      physical activity, sedentary time, and anxiety have persisted approximately one
      year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in a university population.

TI  - Efficacy of telerehabilitation for spine pain during the Coronavirus pandemic
      lockdown: a retrospective propensity score-matched analysis.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/17483107.2022.2107718 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite increased usage of telemedicine to deliver treatment during the 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the efficacy of telerehabilitation 
      for spine pain is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of
      telerehabilitation on pain and disability in patients with spine pain treated
      during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare the results to in-clinic rehabilitation.
      MATERIALS & METHODS: In this propensity score-matched analysis, 428 patients with
      spine pain who underwent telerehabilitation during the 6 months of COVID-19
      pandemic lockdown and 428 patients who underwent in-clinic multimodal
      rehabilitation treatment during the 6-month period prior to lockdown were
      compared. Propensity score matching was done based on gender, age, pre-treatment 
      pain, and disability. Post-treatment numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), Oswestry
      or Neck disability index (ODI or NDI), and minimal clinical important difference 
      (MCID) achieved for NPRS and ODI/NDI scores were compared between the 2 groups.
      RESULTS: Post-treatment, the mean NPRS (mean difference - 1, p < 0.0001) and
      ODI/NDI (mean difference - 5.8, p < 0.0001) scores, were significantly lower in
      the telerehabilitation group when compared to control group. Similarly, the
      percentage of patients who achieved MCID of >/= 2 for NPRS (mean difference - 6%,
      p = 0.0007) and MCID of >/= 10 for ODI/NDI (mean difference - 7.5%, p = 0.005)
      scores were significantly higher in the telerehabilitation group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Telerehabilitation achieved significant reduction in pain and disability among
      patients with spine pain, better than in-clinic rehabilitation. These encouraging

TI  - Suspected Interstitial Lung Disease in COPDGene.
LID - 10.1164/rccm.202203-0550OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: While interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), specific patterns of
      incidentally-detected abnormal density on computed tomography (CT), have been
      associated with abnormal lung function and increased mortality, it is unclear if 
      a subset with incidental interstitial lung disease (ILD) accounts for these
      adverse consequences. OBJECTIVES: To define the prevalence and risk factors of
      suspected ILD and assess outcomes. METHODS: Suspected ILD was evaluated in the
      COPDGene cohort, defined as ILA and at least one additional criterion: definite
      fibrosis on CT, FVC less than 80% predicted, or DLCO less than 70% predicted.
      Multivariable linear, longitudinal, and Cox proportional hazards regression
      models were used to assess associations with St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ), Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), supplemental oxygen use,
      respiratory exacerbations, and mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 4361 
      participants with available data, 239 (5%) had evidence for suspected ILD while
      204 (5%) had ILA without suspected ILD. In multivariable analyses, suspected ILD 
      was associated with increased SGRQ score (mean difference [MD] 3.8points; 95%
      confidence interval [CI] 0.6-7.1; P=0.02), reduced 6MWT (MD -35m; 95%CI
      -56m,-13m; P=0.002), greater supplemental oxygen use (odds ratio [OR] 2.3; 95%CI 
      1.1-5.1; P=0.03) and severe respiratory exacerbations (OR 2.9; 95%CI 1.1-7.5;
      P=0.03), and higher mortality (hazard ratio 2.4; 95%CI 1.2-4.6; P=0.01) compared 
      to ILA without suspected ILD. Risk factors associated with suspected ILD included
      self-identified black race (OR 2.0; 95%CI 1.1-3.3; P=0.01) and pack-years smoking
      history (OR 1.2; 95%CI 1.1-1.3; P=0.0005). CONCLUSION: Suspected ILD is present
      in half of those with ILA in COPDGene and is associated with exercise decrements 
      and increased symptoms, supplemental oxygen use, severe respiratory
      exacerbations, and mortality.

TI  - Skin Pigmentation is Negatively Associated with Circulating Vitamin D
      Concentration and Cutaneous Microvascular Endothelial Function.
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00309.2022 [doi]
AB  - Darkly-pigmented individuals are at greatest risk of vitamin D
      insufficiency/deficiency, which may result in microvascular endothelial
      dysfunction via reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and/or increased
      oxidative stress and inflammation. We investigated the associations between skin 
      pigmentation (M-index; skin reflectance spectrophotometry), serum vitamin D
      concentration [25(OH)D], circulating inflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and 
      IL-10) concentrations, and the NO contribution to local heating-induced cutaneous
      vasodilation (%NO-mediated vasodilation) in a diversely pigmented cohort of
      healthy, young adults. An intradermal microdialysis fiber was placed in the
      forearms of 33 healthy adults (14M/19W; 18-27 yrs; M-index, 30-81 a.u.) for local
      delivery of pharmacological agents. Lactated Ringer's solution was perfused
      through the fiber during local heating-induced (39 degrees C) cutaneous
      vasodilation. After attaining stable elevated blood flow, 15mM
      N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; nitric oxide synthase inhibiter) was 
      infused at all sites to quantify %NO-mediated vasodilation. Red cell flux was
      measured (laser-Doppler flowmetry; LDF) and cutaneous vascular conductance
      (CVC=LDF/MAP) was normalized to maximal (%CVCmax; 28mM sodium nitroprusside+43
      degrees C). Serum [25(OH)D] and circulating cytokines were analyzed by ELISA and 
      multiplex assay, respectively. M-index was negatively associated with [25(OH)D]
      (r=-0.57, p<0.0001) and %NO-mediated vasodilation (r=-0.42, p=0.02). Serum
      [25(OH)D] was positively related to %NO (r=0.41, p=0.02). There was a negative
      curvilinear relation between [25(OH)D] and circulating IL-6 (r=-0.56, p<0.001)
      but not TNF-alpha or IL-10 (p>/=0.14). IL-6 was not associated with %NO-mediated 
      vasodilation (p=0.44). These data suggest that vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency
      may contribute to reduced microvascular endothelial function in otherwise
      healthy, darkly-pigmented young adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by reduced muscle mass and
      function. It is well-recognized as a complication in chronic diseases such as
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, little is known about sarcopenia 
      in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study aimed to
      investigate the clinical characteristics of sarcopenia and the association
      between quality of life and sarcopenia in patients with IPF. METHODS: In this
      pilot cross-sectional study, 56 Japanese outpatients with IPF (49 men) were
      enrolled prospectively. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the criteria of the
      Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019. Its associations with clinical
      parameters including age, pulmonary functions, physical performance, and
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were examined. RESULTS: The frequency of
      sarcopenia was 39.3% (n = 22) in this cohort. There were significant differences 
      in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (p = .005), modified Medical Research
      Council score (p = .004), and Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale depression
      score (p = .030) between the sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic groups. On
      multivariate regression analysis, 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was an independent
      factor associated with sarcopenia (odds ratio 1.241, 95% confidence interval
      1.016-1.515, p = .034). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia was associated with PROs and
      physical performance in patients with IPF.

AB  - ObjectiveThe Survey for Memory, Attention, and Reaction Time (SMART) was recently
      introduced as a brief (<5 min), self-administered, web-based measure of cognitive
      performance in older adults. The purpose of this study was threefold: (1) to
      develop preliminary norms on the SMART; (2) to examine the relationship between
      demographic variables (i.e. age, sex, education), device type used, and SMART
      performance; and (3) to assess user attitudes of the SMART. Method A sample of
      1,050 community-dwelling adults (M age =59.5 (15.2), M education = 16.5 (2.1),
      67.1% female, 96% white) was recruited from an ongoing web-based research cohort.
      Participants completed the SMART, which consists of four face-valid cognitive
      tasks assessing visual memory, attention/processing speed, and executive
      functioning. SMART performance outcome metrics were subtest completion time (CT),
      click count, and total CT. Participants provided demographic information and
      completed a survey of user attitudes toward the SMART (i.e. usability,
      acceptability). Results Older age was the only demographic variable associated
      with slower SMART total CT (r = .60, p <.001). Education was not associated with 
      SMART CT or click counts overall (p > .05). Male sex was generally associated
      with longer SMART CT (p < .001, partial eta squared = .14) on all sub-tests.
      Regarding acceptability, 97.3% indicated willingness to take the SMART again,
      with more than half willing to complete it on a weekly basis. Conclusion The
      preliminary normative data on the SMART indicates that it is a feasible and
      well-accepted web-based cognitive assessment tool that can be administered on
      multiple device platforms.

      practical approach to evaluate PD practice ability of the patients and to
      identify berries to self-care PD. METHODS: A structural form was designed
      comprising measures of physical, cognitive, and operational abilities which were 
      required to perform manual PD independently. The evaluation was jointly conducted
      by a PD nurse, a nephrologist and a close family member of the patient. Patients 
      who met all the requirements were deemed as capable of performing PD
      independently (self-care PD) and others were deemed as needing an assistant
      (assisted PD). RESULTS: The evaluation form was applied in 280 prevalent PD
      patients and 33.9% of them were assessed as needing assisted PD, mainly due to
      physical (62.1%) or operational (66.3%) disabilities. The evaluation result was
      consistent with current dialysis status in 79.3% patients and it matched better
      in patients who performed PD with the help of an assistant (93.0 vs. 76.8%, p =
      0.014). Patients who were evaluated as having barriers to self-care PD but still 
      performed PD without an assistant were older and demonstrated higher prevalence
      of diabetic nephropathy and PD-related infection, lower education level, and
      lower serum albumin (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The PD practice ability assessment
      form is useful to identify patients with barriers to self-care PD. It provides
      objective information to the patients and their family to choose feasible PD
      practice modality, self-care, or assisted PD.

TI  - The possible association of proton pump inhibitor use with acute cholangitis in
      patients with choledocholithiasis: a multi-center study.
PG  - 1-5

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gallstone disease is common worldwide and can lead to severe
      complications, including cholangitis; thus, it is important to identify
      modifiable risk factors for cholangitis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are
      commonly prescribed to treat gastroenterological disorders. We aimed to explore
      whether PPI use is associated with an increased risk of acute cholangitis in
      patients with gallstone disease. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study
      included all patients arriving to the hospital over a 10-year period with various
      presentations of choledocholithiasis. We compared active PPI use in two groups:
      those with cholangitis (group A) vs. without cholangitis (group B). RESULTS:
      Overall, 811 patients were included, 161 in group A and 650 in group B. The
      average age +/- standard deviation (SD) in groups A and B was 74.5 +/- 20.6 vs.
      61.6 +/- 20.9 years, respectively. PPI use in group A was higher vs. group B
      (42.9% vs. 29.1%, p = 0.001). On univariate analysis, male gender (OR 1.47, 95%
      confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.08), age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05), ischemic
      heart disease (IHD) (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.07-2.64), hyperlipidemia (OR 1.59, 95% CI 
      1.11-2.29), hypertension (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.28-2.57) and PPI use (OR 1.83, 95% CI
      1.28-2.61), all were associated with acute cholangitis. On multivariate analysis,
      only PPI use kept its association after adjustment for age (OR 1.64, 95% CI
      1.2-3.7). CONCLUSIONS: Active PPI use was associated with a higher rate of
      cholangitis among patients with choledocholithiasis. We advocate considering this
      risk before prescribing PPIs to patients with gallstones. TRIAL REGISTRATION

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Esophageal variceal bleeding is a common reason for
      hospitalization in patients with cirrhosis. The main objective of this study was 
      to analyze the effects of gender differences on outcomes in hospitalizations
      related to Esophageal variceal bleeding in the United States. METHODS: A
      retrospective observational cohort study was performed using the National
      Inpatient Sample (NIS) database for all hospitalizations with a discharge
      diagnosis of esophageal varices with hemorrhage from 2016 to 2019. The primary
      outcome was in-hospital mortality, while secondary outcomes included rate of
      early endoscopy (defined as less than 1 day), AKI, blood transfusion, sepsis, ICU
      admission and TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt). We also
      compared the length of stay and total hospitalization charges. RESULTS: We
      identified a total of 166,760 patients with variceal bleeding of which 32.7% were
      females. In-hospital mortality was higher in males, 9.91%, compared to females,
      8.31% (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.88, p-value=.008, when adjusted for
      confounding factors). The odds of undergoing an EGD, length of stay, or total
      hospitalization charges did not differ between the two groups. Compared to men,
      women had lower odds of receiving TIPS (aOR = 0.83, p-value=.002). CONCLUSION:
      Women hospitalised with esophageal variceal bleeding are at a lower risk of death
      compared to males. Further research is needed to elucidate the factors associated
      with this lower risk.

TI  - Serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 as a potential biomarker for
      diagnosis and prognosis of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 2153-2166
LID - 10.1080/07853890.2022.2104921 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) has been
      reported to be related to the risk of some cancers. Here we focussed on serum
      IGFBP3 as a possible biomarker of diagnosis and prognosis for oesophageal
      squamous carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was
      used to measure the serum IGFBP3 level in the training cohort including 136 ESCC 
      patients and 119 normal controls and the validation cohort with 55 ESCC patients 
      and 42 normal controls. The receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) was
      used to assess the diagnosis value. Cox proportional hazards model was applied to
      select factors for survival nomogram construction. RESULTS: Serum IGFBP3 levels
      were significantly lower in early-stage ESCC or ESCC patients than those in
      normal controls (p < .05). The specificity and sensitivity of serum IGFBP3 for
      the diagnosis of ESCC were 95.80% and 50.00%, respectively, with the area under
      the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.788 in the training cohort. Similar results were
      observed in the validation cohort (88.10%, 38.18%, and 0.710). Importantly, serum
      IGFBP3 could also differentiate early-stage ESCC from controls (95.80%, 52.54%,
      0.777 and 88.10%, 36.36%, 0.695 in training and validation cohorts,
      respectively). Furthermore, Cox multivariate analysis revealed that serum IGFBP3 
      was an independent prognostic risk factor (HR = 2.599, p = .002). Lower serum
      IGFBP3 level was correlated with reduced overall survival (p < .05). Nomogram
      based on serum IGFBP3, TNM stage, and tumour size improved the prognostic
      prediction of ESCC with a concordance index of 0.715. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated
      that serum IGFBP3 was a potential biomarker of diagnosis and prognosis for ESCC. 
      Meanwhile, the nomogram might help predict the prognosis of ESCC. Key
      MessageSerum IGFBP3 showed early diagnostic value in oesophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma with independent cohort validation. Moreover, serum IGFBP3 was
      identified as an independent prognostic risk factor, which was used to construct 
      a nomogram with improved prognosis ability in oesophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma.

PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/08820139.2022.2108325 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Defects in apoptotic cell clearance is a pathogenic factor in
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study screened potential pathogenic
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to anti-apoptosis from an SLE
      family and explored their contribution to SLE susceptibility in Chinese women.
      METHODS: Four SNPs (IKBKE rs15672, BANK1 rs12640056, BANK1 rs6842661, and NFKBIA 
      rs1957106) with potential SLE susceptibility were analyzed for clinical
      characteristics between 567 patients with SLE and 345 healthy control subjects.
      RESULTS: IKBKE rs15672 G/A and BANK1 rs12640056C/T polymorphisms were associated 
      with SLE susceptibility (rs15672 A vs G, P = 0.028, OR = 1.25, 95% CI =
      1.02-1.52; rs12640056 T vs C, P = 0.015, OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.64-0.95,
      respectively). In addition, patients with AA+GA genotypes of IKBKE rs15672 had
      higher positive rates of anti-SSB antibodies (q = 0.008) and lower positive rates
      of anti-RIB antibodies (q = 0.024) than those with the GG genotype. There were no
      significant differences in BANK1 rs12640056 between different genotypes and
      clinical characteristics. CONCLUSION: IKBKE rs15672 G/A and BANK1 rs12640056C/T
      polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to SLE in Chinese women. This
      highlights the important role of these two SNPs in this disease and suggests that
      multiple genes from these pathways are candidates for functional studies and
      therapeutic targets.

      mobile-bearing HINTEGRA prosthesis, with a mean follow-up of 83.5 months (range, 
      36 to 182 months), and subsequently divided them into 2 groups: the osteolysis
      group (79 ankles) and non-osteolysis group (171 ankles). Clinical and
      radiographic outcomes were compared between the 2 groups, and a bivariable
      logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predisposing factors for
      the development of osteolysis. RESULTS: In the osteolysis group (31.6% of the 250
      ankles), the mean time of detection was 28.8 months postoperatively. Forty of
      these ankles were closely monitored without surgical treatment. Another 29 ankles
      underwent bone grafting and exchange of the polyethylene inlay, and the remaining
      10 ankles underwent revision TAA or arthrodesis. All clinical outcome variables
      were significantly lower in patients with osteolysis, compared with those without
      osteolysis, at the final follow-up (p < 0.05). In the investigation of
      predisposing factors, only rheumatoid arthritis was identified as having a
      significant association with an increased prevalence of osteolysis (p = 0.030).
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the prevalence of periprosthetic
      osteolysis after TAA was considerable and that the development of osteolysis
      negatively affected the clinical outcome. Therefore, the prevention and
      appropriate treatment of osteolysis are crucial for the satisfactory long-term
      survival of TAA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for
      Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - Objective: The efficacy of effort appraisal exercise action plans was tested
      among underactive and inactive university students (N = 221). Methods: Students
      were randomized across three conditions (information, action planning, or
      realistic effort action planning (REAP)) and participated in psychoeducational
      small-group sessions. Students returned after a three-week pedometer tracking
      period and at two and six months to assess self-reported exercise. Results:
      Greater three-week step averages were observed for the action planning and REAP
      conditions compared to the information condition. The information condition
      showed small-sized exercise increases at two and six months (d = .26, d = .35, ps
      < .05); the action planning condition showed a small-sized increase at six months
      (d = . 36, p < 05); and the REAP condition showed medium-sized increases at two
      and six months (d = .40, d = . 46, ps < .05). Conclusions: The findings provide
      initial evidence showing exercise action plans for college students might be
      improved with explicit appraisals of prior effort and persistence.

      and in-vivo assessments.
PG  - 1-23

AB  - The DPP-4 inhibition is an interesting target for the development of antidiabetic
      agents which promotes the longevity of GPL-1(Glucagon-like peptide 1). The
      current study was intended to assess DPP-4(Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4) inhibition
      mediated antidiabetic effect of phytocompounds of an aqueous fruit extract of
      Withania coagulans (Stocks) Dunal by in-vitro, in-silico and in-vivo approaches. 
      The phytoconstituents screening was executed by LCMS (Liquid Chromatography with 
      tandem mass spectrometry). The in-vitro and in-vivo, DPP-4 assays were performed 
      by using available kits. The in-vitro DPP-4 activity was inhibited up to 68.3% by
      the test extract. Accordingly, in-silico determinations of molecular docking,
      molecular dynamics and pharmacokinetics were performed between the target enzyme 
      DPP-4 and leading phytocompounds. The molecular dynamics authenticated the
      molecular docking data by crucial parameters of cytosolic milieu by the potential
      energy, RSMD (Root Mean Square Deviation), RSMF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation),
      system density, NVT (Number of particles at fixed volume, ensemble) and NPT
      (Number of particles at fixed pressure, ensemble). Accordingly, ADMET predictions
      assessed the druggability profile. Subsequently, the course of the test extract
      and the sitagliptin (positive control), instigated significant (p </= 0.001)
      ameliorations in HOMA indices and the equal of antioxidants in
      nicotinamide-streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetic animal model.
      Compassionately, the histopathology represented increased pancreatic cellular
      mass which caused in restoration of histoarchitectures. It has been concluded
      that phytoconstituents in W. coagulans aqueous fruit extract can regulate DPP-4, 
      resulting in improved glucose homeostasis and enhanced endocrinal pancreatic
      cellular mass.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

TI  - Consumer Perspectives on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Technology and
      Automation in Crisis Support Services: Mixed Methods Study.
PG  - e34514
LID - 10.2196/34514 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), have the
      potential to enhance service responsiveness and quality, improve reach to
      underserved groups, and help address the lack of workforce capacity in health and
      mental health care. However, little research has been conducted on the
      acceptability of AI, particularly in mental health and crisis support, and how
      this may inform the development of responsible and responsive innovation in the
      area. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the level of support for the use of
      technology and automation, such as AI, in Lifeline's crisis support services in
      Australia; the likelihood of service use if technology and automation were
      implemented; the impact of demographic characteristics on the level of support
      and likelihood of service use; and reasons for not using Lifeline's crisis
      support services if technology and automation were implemented in the future.
      METHODS: A mixed methods study involving a computer-assisted telephone interview 
      and a web-based survey was undertaken from 2019 to 2020 to explore expectations
      and anticipated outcomes of Lifeline's crisis support services in a nationally
      representative community sample (n=1300) and a Lifeline help-seeker sample
      (n=553). Participants were aged between 18 and 93 years. Quantitative descriptive
      analysis, binary logistic regression models, and qualitative thematic analysis
      were conducted to address the research objectives. RESULTS: One-third of the
      community and help-seeker participants did not support the collection of
      information about service users through technology and automation (ie, via AI),
      and approximately half of the participants reported that they would be less
      likely to use the service if automation was introduced. Significant demographic
      differences were observed between the community and help-seeker samples. Of the
      demographics, only older age predicted being less likely to endorse technology
      and automation to tailor Lifeline's crisis support service and use such services 
      (odds ratio 1.48-1.66, 99% CI 1.03-2.38; P<.001 to P=.005). The most common
      reason for reluctance, reported by both samples, was that respondents wanted to
      speak to a real person, assuming that human counselors would be replaced by
      automated robots or machine services. CONCLUSIONS: Although Lifeline plans to
      always have a real person providing crisis support, help-seekers automatically
      fear this will not be the case if new technology and automation such as AI are
      introduced. Consequently, incorporating innovative use of technology to improve
      help-seeker outcomes in such services will require careful messaging and
      assurance that the human connection will continue.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of nafamostat mesilate anticoagulation in blood purification 
      treatment of critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1263-1279
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2022.2105233 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nafamostat mesilate (NM), a broad-spectrum and potent serine protease
      inhibitor, can be used as an anticoagulant during extracorporeal circulation, as 
      well as a promising drug effective against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
      We conducted a systematic meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NM
      administration in critically ill patients who underwent blood purification
      therapy (BPT). METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Web of Science and PubMed were
      comprehensively searched from inception to August 20, 2021, for potential
      studies. RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven
      observational studies with 2723 patients met the inclusion criteria. The
      meta-analysis demonstrated that conventional therapy (CT) significantly increased
      hospital mortality compared with NM administration (RR = 1.25, p = 0.0007). In
      subgroup analyses, the in-hospital mortality of the NM group was significantly
      lower than that of the anticoagulant-free (NA) group (RR = 1.31, p = 0.002). The 
      CT interventions markedly elevated the risk ratio of bleeding complications by
      45% (RR = 1.45, p = 0.010) compared with NM interventions. In another subgroup
      analysis, NM used exhibited a significantly lower risk of bleeding complications 
      than those of the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) used (RR = 4.58, p =
      0.020). The filter lifespan was decreased significantly (MD = -10.59, p < 0.0001)
      in the NA groups compared with the NM groups. Due to the poor quality of the
      included RCTs, these results should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSION:
      Given the better survival outcomes, lower risk of bleeding, NM anticoagulation
      seems to be a safe and efficient approach for BPT patients and could yield a
      favorable filter lifespan. More multi-center RCTs with large samples are required
      for further validation of this study.

TI  - A Nutritional Blend Suppresses the Inflammatory Response from Bronchial
      Epithelial Cells Induced by SARS-CoV-2.
PG  - 1-15
LID - 10.1080/19390211.2022.2103607 [doi]
AB  - Even after virus elimination, numerous sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) persist. Based on accumulating evidence, large amounts of
      proinflammatory cytokines are released to drive COVID-19 progression, severity,
      and mortality, and their levels remain elevated after the acute phase of
      COVID-19, playing a central role in the disease' sequelae. In this manner,
      bronchial epithelial cells are the first cells hyperactivated by severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to massive cytokine
      release, triggering the hyperactivation of leukocytes and other cells, and
      mediating COVID-19 sequelae. Therefore, proinflammatory cytokine production is
      initiated by the host. This in vitro study tested the hypothesis that
      ImmuneRecov, a nutritional blend, inhibits the SARS-CoV-2-induced hyperactivation
      of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). BEAS-2B (5x10(4)/mL/well) cells
      were cocultivated with 1 ml of blood from a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient for 4 h, 
      and the nutritional blend (1 microg/mL) was added in the first minute of
      coculture. After 4 h, the cells were recovered and used for analyses of
      cytotoxicity with the (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium
      bromide) (MTT) assay and the expression of the IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNAs.
      The supernatant was collected to measure cytokine levels. SARS-CoV-2 incubation
      resulted in increased levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 in BEAS-2B cells (p < 0.001).
      Treatment with the nutritional blend resulted in reduced levels of the
      proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6 (p < 0.001) and increased levels of
      the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (p < 0.001). Additionally, the nutritional
      blend reduced the expression of the IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNAs in

TI  - The value of postoperative HLA-DR expression and high mobility group box 1 level 
      in predictive diagnosis of sepsis in percutaneous nephrolithotomy surgery.
PG  - 1338-1344
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2022.2107541 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the value of postoperative human leukocyte antigen-DR
      (HLA-DR) expression and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) level in predictive
      diagnosis of postoperative sepsis for patients with percutaneous nephrolithotomy 
      (PCNL) surgery. METHODS: The present prospective observational study included 387
      patients with renal calculus who received PCNL surgery from January 2017 to
      October 2020 in our hospital. After exclusion criteria, 33 patients with sepsis
      and 78 patients with no sepsis remained. All patients received PCNL surgery.
      Sepsis definition is according to the third international consensus definitions
      for sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3). The data of the HMGB1, c-reactive protein
      (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT) and HLA-DR expression were
      collected within admission and 24 h and 72 h after surgery. Postoperative HMGB1
      levels and HLA-DR expression at 24 h and 72 h were respectively compared between 
      the two groups using t test. ROC cure was used to analyze the value of
      postoperative HLA-DR expression and HMGB1 level in predictive diagnosis of
      sepsis. RESULTS: The positive rate of urine culture and the time of
      hospitalization time in patients with sepsis were significantly higher than those
      in patients with no sepsis. Sepsis group had higher levels of HMGB1 at post-24 h 
      ((93.07 +/- 11.37) ng/mL vs (75.41 +/- 4.85) ng/mL), p < 0.05) and 72 h ((96.58
      +/- 12.12) ng/mL vs (81.16 +/- 8.86) ng/mL), p < 0.05) than nosepsis group.
      Meanwhile, sepsis group had lower expression of HLA-DR at post-24 h ((50.01 +/-
      7.42) % vs (69.32 +/- 10.58) %), p < 0.05) and 72 h ((54.85 +/- 9.45) % vs (69.98
      +/- 11.00) %), p < 0.05) than non-sepsis group. ROC analysis showed that the
      HLA-DR expression at postoperative 24 h had highest predictive value in the
      diagnosis of sepsis, the AUC of HLA-DR was 0.934, cutoff value 56.19%, with
      sensitivity 89.7%, specificity 81.8%. CONCLUSION: Postoperative HLA-DR and HMGB1 
      can both be used as a predictive diagnosis of sepsis for patients with renal
      calculus received PCNL surgery. HighlightsSepsis group had higher levels of high 
      mobility group box 1 at post-24 h and 72 h than nosepsis group.Sepsis group had
      lower expression of HLA-DR at post-24 h and 72 h than nosepsis

TI  - Oncologic outcomes of salvage surgery and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in 
      recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A single-institution
      retrospective study.
LID - 10.1002/hed.27162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival outcomes in recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
      (HNSCC) are poor. This study aimed to compare survival outcomes between salvage
      surgery and immunotherapy in patients with recurrent advanced HNSCC. METHODS:
      Patients with advanced stage (stage III or IV) recurrent HNSCC following
      treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy were included. Survival was estimated 
      using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was used for multivariate
      logistic regression. RESULTS: Two-year overall survival after salvage surgery was
      68.6% and after immunotherapy patients was 24.6%. Multivariate logistic
      regression showed that salvage surgery was associated with improved survival
      without statistical significance (hazard ratio [HR] 0.12, p = 0.25). Subgroup
      analysis of patients with oral cavity/oropharyngeal cancer noted improved
      survival with salvage surgery over immunotherapy (HR 0.006, p = 0.01) and
      decreased survival with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 5 (HR 6.4, p =
      0.02). CONCLUSION: Our retrospective single-institutional data suggest that
      resectable advanced stage recurrent HNSCC may have improved survival with salvage
      surgery in appropriately selected patients, but larger prospective studies are
      required.

TI  - Preoperative serum hepatitis B virus DNA was a risk factor for hepatocellular
      carcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation.
PG  - 2213-2221
LID - 10.1080/07853890.2022.2107233 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumour characteristics and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT)
      criteria are risks for recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In Asia,
      most HCC is caused by chronic hepatitis B infection. Whether hepatitis B virus
      DNA (HBV DNA) is a risk factor for HCC recurrence after OLT is not clear.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we classified patients into
      groups of detectable and undetectable HBV DNA, non-HCC recurrence, and recurrence
      and performed analyses on differed characteristics between groups and risk
      factors for HCC recurrence after OLT. RESULTS: Among patients who underwent OLT
      for HCC, 117 were secondary to CHB infection. CHB was not a risk, but advanced
      tumour characteristics were risk factor for HCC recurrence. In patients with
      CHB-HCC, 24 (20.5%) of 117 patients had HCC recurrence. Compared to patients with
      HBV DNA undetectable (n = 75), patients with detectable HBV DNA (n = 42) had
      higher AFP concentration (p < .001), higher proportion of macrovascular invasion 
      (p = .014), greater tumour diameter (p < .001), poorer TNM stage (p = .017), and 
      higher proportion of extended OLT criteria (p = .011) and HCC recurrence (p =
      .036). Preoperative HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL was an independent risk factor for HCC
      recurrence (OR = 8.35, 95% CI 1.40, 50.00, p = .020). HBV DNA detectable was not 
      a risk for HCC-related death. CONCLUSION: Individuals with preoperative
      undetectable HBV DNA had advanced tumour characteristics and a higher proportion 
      of HCC recurrence. Antiviral treatment for HCC should be performed, and HBV DNA
      undetectable should be obtained before OLT. But for an urgent OLT, preoperative
      detectable HBV DNA may not affect long-term survival.KEY MESSAGESPatients with
      HBV DNA detectable had advanced tumour characteristics, a higher proportion of
      extended OLT criteria, and HCC-recurrence.HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL was a risk factor
      for HCC recurrence.HBV DNA detectable was not a risk for HCC related death;
      extended OLT criteria affected long-term survival.

PG  - 1-30
LID - 10.1080/02713683.2022.2110597 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: miRNAs can regulate inflammatory pathways. The purpose of this work was 
      to determine if inflammatory-related tear film miRNAs are associated with
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) in human non-Sjogren's Syndrome dry eye disease
      (DED) participants. METHODS: Five DED and 5 non-DED human participants were
      recruited. Tears samples were collected by washing the ocular surface of both
      eyes with phosphate buffered saline, pooling samples from the right and left
      eyes, and purifying EVs from the samples with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000
      precipitation procedure. Samples were directly analyzed via ELISA or transmission
      electron microscopy (TEM), or RNA was isolated first from the EVs and evaluated
      with RNA-Seq. RESULTS: EVs were identified in the tear film of both groups using 
      TEM and ELISA. Following EV purification and RNA isolation, RNA-Seq determined
      that there were 126 EV miRNAs differentially expressed between the two groups
      when comparing their RNA cargoes. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis found 9 upregulated
      miRNAs that were associated with inflammation (miR-127-5p, miR-1273h-3p,
      miR-1288-5p, miR-130b-5p, miR-139-3p, miR-1910-5p, miR-203b-5p, miR-22-5p, and
      miR-4632-3p; all p < 0.049; fold regulation range =1.43 to 1.67). CONCLUSION:
      This study determined that EVs are present in the tear film and that tear EVs
      contain miRNAs that may be associated with DED inflammatory pathways.

TI  - Longitudinal Clinical and Cognitive Changes Along the Alzheimer Disease Continuum
      in Down Syndrome.
PG  - e2225573
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25573 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the main medical problem in adults with
      Down syndrome (DS). However, the associations of age, intellectual disability
      (ID), and clinical status with progression and longitudinal cognitive decline
      have not been established. Objective: To examine clinical progression along the
      AD continuum and its related cognitive decline and to explore the presence of
      practice effects and floor effects with repeated assessments. Design, Setting,
      and Participants: This is a single-center cohort study of adults (aged >18 years)
      with DS with different ID levels and at least 6 months of follow-up between
      November 2012 and December 2021. The data are from a population-based health plan
      designed to screen for AD in adults with DS in Catalonia, Spain. Individuals were
      classified as being asymptomatic, having prodromal AD, or having AD dementia.
      Exposures: Neurological and neuropsychological assessments. Main Outcomes and
      Measures: The main outcome was clinical change along the AD continuum. Cognitive 
      decline was measured by the Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults With
      Down Syndrome and the modified Cued Recall Test. Results: A total of 632 adults
      with DS (mean [SD] age, 42.6 [11.4] years; 292 women [46.2%]) with 2847
      evaluations (mean [SD] follow-up, 28.8 [18.7] months) were assessed. At baseline,
      there were 436 asymptomatic individuals, 69 patients with prodromal AD, and 127
      with AD dementia. After 5 years of follow-up, 17.1% (95% CI, 12.5%-21.5%) of
      asymptomatic individuals progressed to symptomatic AD in an age-dependent manner 
      (0.6% [95% CI, 0%-1.8%] for age <40 years; 21.1% [95% CI, 8.0%-32.5%] for age
      40-44 years; 41.4% [95% CI, 23.1%-55.3%] for age 45-49 years; 57.5% [95% CI,
      38.2%-70.8%] for age >/=50 years; P < .001), and 94.1% (95% CI, 84.6%-98.0%) of
      patients with prodromal AD progressed to dementia with no age dependency.
      Cognitive decline in the older individuals was most common among those who
      progressed to symptomatic AD and symptomatic individuals themselves. Importantly,
      individuals with mild and moderate ID had no differences in longitudinal
      cognitive decline despite having different performance at baseline. This study
      also found practice and floor effects, which obscured the assessment of
      longitudinal cognitive decline. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found an
      association between the development of symptomatic AD and a high risk of
      progressive cognitive decline among patients with DS. These results support the
      need for population health plans to screen for AD-related cognitive decline from 
      the fourth decade of life and provide important longitudinal data to inform
      clinical trials in adults with DS to prevent AD.

TI  - Hepcidin-to-Ferritin Ratio as an Early Diagnostic Index of Iron Overload in
      beta-Thalassemia Major Patients.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/03630269.2022.2083969 [doi]
AB  - Hepcidin (HEPC) hormone production is expected to be elevated in cases
      accompanying iron overload, but the opposite impact of ineffective erythropoiesis
      in beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) patients overrides this effect. The role of
      the HEPC-to-ferritin (FER) ratio and its components in iron metabolism along with
      their diagnostic cutoff values, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in beta-TM
      patients with iron overload, were examined in this study. This was a 1:1
      case-control study with 120 participants, ages ranging from 2 to 30 years of both
      sexes, who were assigned into two groups: 60 beta-TM patients with iron overload,
      and a control group, comprising 60 healthy individuals matched by gender and age.
      In the present study, we found slightly elevated serum HEPC concentration (21.9
      ng/mL) compared to the controls (9.9 ng/mL), which was not statistically
      significant (p =0.1), and the median HEPC-to-FER ratio of the cases was
      significantly lower than the controls, with the median case-control difference of
      (-0.366; p < 0.001). Our results revealed a statistically significant impact (p <
      0.001) of mean age on the serum HEPC level with the inverse linear correlation of
      (-0.487, p < 0.001). The area under the curve of the HEPC-to-FER ratio was 0.999 
      and the optimum cutoff value was 0.046 ng/mL (p < 0.001) with 100.0% sensitivity 
      and 98.3% specificity. In conclusion, we found that serum HEPC-to-FER ratio, with
      an accuracy of 99.2%, may serve as an excellent index for the diagnosis of iron
      overload in beta-TM patients differentiating them from nonthalassemic controls.

TI  - Impact of Prediabetes on Cardiac Function Among Primary Care Patients.
LID - 10.1089/met.2021.0006 [doi]
AB  - Background: Prediabetes is a novel risk factor recently associated with changes
      in the left ventricle. Our aim is to determine if prediabetes is associated with 
      heart failure (HF) and structural heart disease. Methods: We conducted a
      cross-sectional study and performed screening echocardiograms to consecutive
      primary care patients. We calculated the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) within 3 months
      of the echocardiogram and classified patients as having normal glucose, low-risk 
      or high-risk prediabetes or diabetes. Our primary outcome was HF defined as an
      ejection fraction (EF) <50% and HF with preserved EF. Our secondary outcome was
      structural heart disease defined as having either a large atrium, left
      ventricular hypertrophy, or low EF. Results: We included 15,056 patients who
      underwent a screening echocardiogram and had a recorded HbA1c. Only 2794 patients
      had a normal blood glucose, 4201 had low-risk prediabetes, 2499 had high-risk
      prediabetes, and the remainder had diabetes. The adjusted odds ratio (ORs) of HF 
      for low-risk prediabetes, high-risk prediabetes and diabetes were 1.38
      [confidence interval (95% CI) 1.07-1.78] (P = 0.01), 1.47 (95% CI 1.05-2.01) (P =
      0.01), and 1.60 (95% CI 1.16-2.01) (P < 0.01), respectively, when compared with
      normoglycemic patients. The adjusted OR of HF with preserved EF for low- and
      high-risk prediabetes and diabetes were 1.17 (95% CI 0.86-1.60) (P = 0.30), 1.60 
      (95% CI 1.15-2.21) (P < 0.01), and 1.63 (95% CI 1.24-2.13) (P < 0.01),
      respectively, when compared with normoglycemic patients. Conclusions: Prediabetes
      is a prevalent condition associated with structural heart disease and HF.

TI  - Longitudinal Evaluation of Changes in Retinal Architecture Using Optical
      Coherence Tomography in Achromatopsia.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1167/iovs.63.9.6 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This prospective study investigates longitudinal changes in retinal
      structure in patients with achromatopsia (ACHM) using optical coherence
      tomography (OCT). Methods: Seventeen patients (five adults, 12 children) with
      genetically confirmed CNGA3- or CNGB3-associated ACHM underwent ocular
      examination and OCT over a follow-up period of between 2 and 9.33 years (mean =
      5.7 years). Foveal tomograms were qualitatively graded and were segmented for
      quantitative analysis: central macular thickness (CMt), outer nuclear layer
      thickness (ONLt), and size of the foveal hyporeflective zone (vertical HRZ
      thickness: HRZt and horizontal HRZ width: HRZw) were measured. Data were analyzed
      using linear mixed regression models. Both age and visit were included into the
      models, to explore the possibility that the rate of disease progression depends
      on patient age. Results: Fifteen of 17 patients (88%) showed longitudinal changes
      in retinal structure over the follow-up period. The most common patterns of
      progression was development of ellipsoid zone (EZ) disruption and HRZ. There was 
      a significant increase in HRZt (P = 0.01) and HRZw (P = 0.001) between visits and
      no significant change in CMt and ONLt. Retinal parameters showed no difference in
      changes by genetic mutation (CNGA3 (n = 11), CNGB3 (n = 6)). Conclusions: This
      study demonstrates clear longitudinal changes in foveal structure mainly in
      children, but also in adults with ACHM, over a long follow-up period. The
      longitudinal foveal changes suggest that treatment at an earlier age should be
      favored.

TI  - Selection of deep or superficial recipient vein in lower extremity reconstruction
      using free flap: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1002/micr.30946 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Free flap surgeries are useful procedures for lower-extremity
      reconstruction. Recipient vein selection for anastomosis is important to avoid
      venous congestion and thrombosis. Although deep or superficial venous system can 
      be used as a recipient vein site, there is a lack of consensus on which system
      would be superior to avoid postoperative complications. This systematic review
      and meta-analysis aimed to assess the differences in outcomes between deep and
      superficial vein anastomosis for lower-extremity free flap reconstruction.
      METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library medical
      databases were systematically searched from inception to April 2022, in
      accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
      Meta-analyses guidelines. A comparative meta-analysis was conducted on studies of
      deep and superficial venous system anastomosis outcomes, comprising vascular
      thrombosis, reoperation, complete flap necrosis, and any flap necrosis. The
      fixed-effects meta-analysis model was used when low heterogeneity (I(2) < 50%)
      was present. RESULTS: Six studies with 789 flaps were included in the analysis
      and qualitative and quantitative syntheses. The rate of vascular thrombosis (8.2%
      vs. 15.1%; p = .005) was significantly lower for flaps involving deep vein
      anastomosis than for those involving superficial vein anastomosis. The rate of
      reoperation after deep vein anastomosis was lower than that after superficial
      vein anastomosis, with no statistically significant difference (9.0% vs. 14.7%; p
      = .06). There were no significant differences in the rates of complete (2.5% vs. 
      2.0%; p = .90) or any flap necrosis (7.0% vs. 9.8%; p = .20). CONCLUSION: Deep
      vein anastomosis might be recommended for avoiding vascular thrombosis.

      aimed to evaluate the value of static perimetry in the objective assessment and
      follow-up of negative dysphotopsia. METHODS: Peripheral 60-4 full-threshold
      visual field tests were performed in 27 patients with negative dysphotopsia and
      33 pseudophakic controls. In addition, 11 patients with negative dysphotopsia
      repeated the test after an intraocular lens exchange. Both the total peripheral
      visual field and the averaged peripheral visual field from 50 to 60 degrees
      eccentricity were compared between patients and controls, and pre-operatively and
      post-operatively in patients who had an intraocular lens exchange. RESULTS: The
      peripheral visual fields from 30 to 60 degrees did not show significant
      differences between patients with negative dysphotopsia and pseudophakic
      controls. Analysis of the peripheral visual field from 50 to 60 degrees showed a 
      median [Q1, Q3] of 20.0 [17.1, 22.5] dB in the negative dysphotopsia group
      compared with 20.1 [15.5, 21.3] dB in the control group (P = .43). Although 82%
      of patients treated with an intraocular lens exchange subjectively reported
      improvement of their negative dysphotopsia complaints post-operatively, there
      were no significant differences in their total peripheral visual field or
      averaged peripheral visual field from 50 to 60 degrees (P = .92). CONCLUSIONS:
      Full-threshold static perimetry with a Goldmann size III stimulus up to 60
      degrees eccentricity does not show significant differences between patients with 
      negative dysphotopsia and pseudophakic controls or between measurements before
      and after intraocular lens exchange. Therefore, this type of static perimetry
      cannot be used as a quantitative objective test for diagnosis or follow-up of
      patients with negative dysphotopsia.

TI  - Evaluation of PGK2 and ACR proteins in seminal plasma: suggestion of potential
      new biomarkers for prediction of sperm retrieval in non-obstructive azoospermia
      patients.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/14647273.2022.2104136 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to assess the role of testis-specific proteins, PGK2 and ACR, in
      the prediction of sperm retrieval results by microdissection testicular sperm
      extraction (micro-TESE) in men with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). This was a
      case-control study including 48 semen samples of NOA patients undergoing the
      micro-TESE procedure, 15 semen samples from normozoospermic men as the positive
      control, and 12 semen samples from obstructive azoospermia/post-vasectomy (OA/PV)
      as negative controls. We investigated the levels of PGK2 and ACR proteins by
      ELISA tests in seminal plasma samples. The ELISA results revealed a significantly
      higher concentration of PGK2 and ACR in the NOA patients with successful sperm
      retrieval (NOA+) in comparison to NOA patients with failed sperm retrieval (NOA-)
      group (p = 0.0001 in both cases). For the first time, the data from this study
      suggests that a seminal PGK2 concentration of 136.3 pg/ml and ACR concentration
      of 21.75 mIU/ml can be used as cut-off values for the prediction of micro-TESE
      outcomes in NOA patients. These findings may be useful to avoid unnecessary
      micro-TESE operations. Overall, the seminal levels of the PGK2 and ACR proteins
      may be useful in predicting sperm retrieval success by micro-TESE in NOA
      patients.

TI  - Silver-Based Dressings in the Prevention of the Incisional Surgical Site
      Infection: A Prospective Multicenter Observational Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.1089/sur.2022.084 [doi]
AB  - Background: A new silver-based dressing has been designed to reduce surgical
      sited infections. Patients and Methods: A prospective multicenter observational
      study was conducted from January 2020 to October 2021. Patients with and without 
      silver-based dressing after surgical incision were observed and their data
      analyzed. The study aimed to assess the incidence of incisional surgical site
      infection and primary healing after general surgery procedures. Results: Overall,
      218 patients with silver-based (n = 109) and conventional silver-free dressing (n
      = 109) were analyzed. Surgical site infection (SSI) and primary incision healing 
      were reported in 10 (9.2%) versus 21 (19.3%) (p = 0.037) and in 95 (87.2%) versus
      86 (78.9%) (p = 0.107) patients treated with and without silver-based dressing,
      respectively. Conclusions: Silver-based dressing demonstrated a lower incidence
      of incisional SSI and improved primary healing in comparison with patients in
      whom conventional non-silver-based dressing has been used.

TI  - Time to Look for Another Infectious Source? White Blood Cell Trends during
      Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia.
LID - 10.1089/sur.2022.094 [doi]
AB  - Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) continues to plague patients in
      intensive care units (ICUs) throughout the world. Persistent leukocytosis despite
      antibiotic treatment for VAP can have many etiologies including normal
      inflammatory response, inadequate VAP antimicrobial therapy, and the presence of 
      additional infectious diagnoses. Hypothesis: Surgical patients with VAP and a
      second infectious source have a different white blood cell count (WBC) trend than
      patients with VAP alone. Patients and Methods: Retrospective, single-center study
      of surgical ICU patients diagnosed with VAP (>10(4) CFU/mL on semi-quantitative
      culture) between January 2019 and June 2020. Chart review identified additional
      infections diagnosed during VAP treatment. White blood cell count values were
      compared between patients treated for VAP alone (VAP-alone) and those with
      additional infections (VAP-plus) using a Wilcoxon test. Univariable analysis
      compared admission type, surgeries, and steroid use between cohorts. Results:
      Eighty-eight VAPs were included for analysis; 61 (69%) were VAP-alone and 27
      (31%) VAP-plus. Average age was 47.1 +/- 16.7 years, 78% were male, and 93% were 
      trauma admissions. Median hospital day of VAP diagnosis was six (interquartile
      range [IQR], 4-10). Nearly all patients (99%) were started on initial antibiotic 
      agents to which the VAP organism was sensitive. Daily WBC was higher for VAP-plus
      compared with VAP-alone on days five, six, and seven of treatment. The maximum
      WBC was higher for VAP-plus (21.6 k/mcL vs. 16.1 k/mcL; p = 0.02). There were no 
      differences in admission types, number of surgeries, or steroid use between
      groups. Conclusions: Providers should have increased suspicion for additional
      sources of infection when ICU patients with a VAP continue to have elevated WBC
      despite appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  - Self-Reported Neck and Back Pain among Supermarket Cashiers in Gaborone,
      Botswana.
PG  - 1-33
LID - 10.1080/10803548.2022.2108653 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Investigate the prevalence, risk factors and impacts of neck and back 
      pain among supermarkets cashiers in Botswana. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      cross-sectional study was conducted among supermarkets cashiers using
      self-administered. Data were analysed using chi(2) and logistic regression
      models. Statistical significance was assumed at p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 174
      supermarkets cashiers participated in this study majority of whom were females
      (72%). The prevalence of lower back pain was 69%, upper back pain 53% and neck
      pain 37%. Increasing age was associated with neck 95% CI [1.43-5.15] and upper
      back 95% CI [1.43-3.60] pain. Cashiers working at low work surface and
      overreaching for items were 19 and 11 times more likely to report neck 95% CI
      [1.7-255.9] and lower back 95% CI [1.84-62.1] pain, respectively. Almost 6% of
      cashiers who reported lower back pain reported considering changing jobs due to
      pain. CONCLUSIONS: More than two-thirds, half and about two-fifths of supermarket
      cashiers reported lower back, upper back and neck pain, respectively. Individual 
      and work-related factors were associated with neck and/or back pain. Back and
      neck pain workers' health and wellbeing, their families, workplace productivity
      and the health care system. To reduce their prevalence and progression,
      supermarkets should introduce occupational health and safety talks.

TI  - The Role of Lymphocyte Subsets, PD-1, and FAS (CD95) in COVID-19 Cancer Patients.
LID - 10.1089/vim.2022.0036 [doi]
AB  - Lymphocytes are the main orchestrators that regulate the immune response in
      SARS-COV-2 infection. The exhaustion of T lymphocytes is a contributing factor to
      lymphopenia, which is responsible for the COVID-19 adverse outcome. However, it
      is still not demonstrated on a large scale, including cancer patients. Peripheral
      blood samples were obtained from 83 SARS-CoV2 infected cancer patients, and 29
      COVID-19 infected noncancer patients compared to 28 age-matched healthy controls.
      Lymphocyte subsets were assessed for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, PD-1, and CD95 using
      flow cytometry. The data were correlated to the patients' clinical features,
      COVID-19 severity and outcomes. Lymphopenia, and decreased CD4(+) T cells and
      CD8(+) T cells were significantly observed in COVID-19 cancer and noncancer
      patients compared to the control group (p < 0.001, for all). There was a
      significantly increased expression of CD95 and PD-1 on the NK cells, CD4(+) T
      cells, and CD8(+) T cells in COVID-19 cancer and noncancer patients in comparison
      to the control group. The increased expression of CD95 on CD8(+) T cells, as well
      as the increased expression of PD-1 on CD8(+) T cells and NK cells are
      significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection in cancer
      patients. The increased expression of CD95 and PD-1 on the CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+)
      T cells, and NK cells was observed significantly in nonsurviving patients and
      those who were admitted to the intensive care unit in COVID-19 cancer and
      noncancer patients. The increased expression of PD-1 and CD95 could be possible
      prognostic factors for COVID-19 severity and adverse outcomes in COVID-19 cancer 
      and noncancer patients.

TI  - A spotlight on avoidance coping to manage fear of recurrence among breast cancer 
      survivors in an eHealth intervention.
LID - 10.1007/s10865-022-00349-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear of recurrence (FoR) is prevalent among breast cancer survivors
      (BCS) and may be exacerbated by avoidance coping. This study examined BCS with
      avoidance coping and their engagement in a FoR eHealth intervention (FoRtitude). 
      METHODS: BCS (N = 196) with elevated FoR participated in FoRtitude.
      Patient-reported measures assessed avoidance coping with FoR and baseline
      emotional and behavioral health. Intervention engagement was measured
      quantitatively (e.g., website logins, telecoaching attendance) and qualitatively 
      (i.e., telecoaching notes). RESULTS: 38 BCS (19%) endorsed avoidance coping,
      which was associated with more severe post-traumatic anxiety-related symptoms and
      worse global mental health (ps < .05), but not anxiety (p = .19), depression (p =
      .11), physical health (p = .12), alcohol consumption (p = .85), or physical
      activity (p = .39). Avoidance coping was not associated with engagement levels
      (ps > .05) but did characterize engagement-related motivators and barriers.
      CONCLUSIONS: Avoidance coping was not a barrier to FoRtitude engagement. eHealth 
      delivery is a promising modality for engaging survivors with avoidance coping in 
      FoR interventions.

TI  - Clinical Outcome of Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon Angioplasty Versus Drug-Eluting
      Stent Implantation for the Treatment of Coronary Drug-Eluting Stent In-Stent
      Chronic Total Occlusion.
LID - 10.1007/s10557-022-07363-7 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: In-stent chronic total occlusion (IS-CTO) represents a unique challenge for
      percutaneous coronary intervention. Whether the optimal treatment for IS-CTO is
      angioplasty with paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCBs) or repeat stenting with
      drug-eluting stents (DESs) is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the long-term
      clinical outcome of PCB angioplasty and DES repeat stenting for DES IS-CTO.
      METHODS: We retrospectively included patients with DES IS-CTO who underwent
      successful PCB angioplasty or DES repeat stenting from January 2016 to December
      2019. The primary endpoints were major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including 
      cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization (TLR). 
      Cox proportional hazards model was performed to compare the risk of MACEs between
      PCB angioplasty and DES repeat stenting, and to further explore the prognostic
      factors of patients with DES IS-CTO. RESULTS: A total of 214 patients with DES
      IS-CTO were enrolled: 78 patients (36.4%) treated with PCB and 136 patients
      (63.6%) treated with DES respectively. The median follow-up was 1160 days, and
      MACEs were observed in 28.2% of patients with PCB angioplasty versus 26.5% of
      patients with DES repeat stenting (P = 0.784), mainly driven by TLR (21.8% vs.
      19.9%, P = 0.735). There was no significant difference in the risk of MACEs
      between the PCB group and the DES group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.25, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 0.64-2.46, P = 0.512). Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that
      chronic kidney disease and >/= 3 stent layers in the lesion were independent
      predictors of MACEs, while switching to another antiproliferative drug was an
      independent protective factor (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PCB angioplasty was an
      effective alternative treatment strategy for DES IS-CTO, which had similar
      long-term outcomes to DES repeat stenting in contemporary practice, but both were
      accompanied by a high rate of long-term MACEs. Improving the poor prognosis of
      patients with DES IS-CTO remains a challenge.

TI  - CD69-oxLDL ligand engagement induces Programmed Cell Death 1 (PD-1) expression in
      human CD4 + T lymphocytes.
PG  - 468
LID - 10.1007/s00018-022-04481-1 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms that control the inflammatory-immune response play a key role in
      tissue remodelling in cardiovascular diseases. T cell activation receptor CD69
      binds to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), inducing the expression of
      anti-inflammatory NR4A nuclear receptors and modulating inflammation in
      atherosclerosis. To understand the downstream T cell responses triggered by the
      CD69-oxLDL binding, we incubated CD69-expressing Jurkat T cells with oxLDL. RNA
      sequencing revealed a differential gene expression profile dependent on the
      presence of CD69 and the degree of LDL oxidation. CD69-oxLDL binding induced the 
      expression of NR4A receptors (NR4A1 and NR4A3), but also of PD-1. These results
      were confirmed using oxLDL and a monoclonal antibody against CD69 in
      CD69-expressing Jurkat and primary CD4 + lymphocytes. CD69-mediated induction of 
      PD-1 and NR4A3 was dependent on NFAT activation. Silencing NR4A3 slightly
      increased PD-1 levels, suggesting a potential regulation of PD-1 by this
      receptor. Moreover, expression of PD-1, CD69 and NR4A3 was increased in human
      arteries with chronic inflammation compared to healthy controls, with a strong
      correlation between PD-1 and CD69 mRNA expression (r = 0.655 P < 0.0001).
      Moreover, PD-1 was expressed in areas enriched in CD3 infiltrating T cells. Our
      results underscore a novel mechanism of PD-1 induction independent of TCR
      signalling that might contribute to the role of CD69 in the modulation of
      inflammation and vascular remodelling in cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - Efficacy of CPAP duration and adherence for cognitive improvement in patients
      with obstructive sleep apnea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 10.1007/s11325-022-02687-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can impair cognition. Continuous positive 
      airway pressure (CPAP) is a recommended treatment for OSA but its effectiveness
      on cognitive improvement is uncertain, a finding which may be biased by various
      durations and adherence to treatment with CPAP. In a meta-analysis assessing
      high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we estimated whether or not
      CPAP benefits cognition in patients with OSA. METHODS: PRISMA criteria were
      followed in the performance of this meta-analysis. The weighted mean difference
      (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of six neuropsychological scores covering 
      eight cognitive domains were used to evaluate the benefit between CPAP and
      non-CPAP interventions. Subgroups of different therapeutic durations and
      adherence, which were divided into short-term (< 8 weeks) and long-term (>/= 12
      weeks) durations, and poor (nighttime < 4 h/night) and good (nighttime >/= 4
      h/night) adherence were also analyzed. RESULTS: Among 16 RCTs, 1529 participants 
      with OSA were included. Comparing the CPAP group and the control group for all
      treatment durations and adherence, a mild improvement for digit span forward
      which reflected short-term memory was observed (WMD[95%CI] = 0.67[0.03,1.31], p =
      0.04). Trail making test-part B, which reflected executive function was improved 
      for participants with OSA who had good adherence to CPAP (WMD[95%CI] = - 6.24[-
      12.60,0.12], p = 0.05). Patients with OSA who received short-term CPAP treatment 
      (WMD[95%CI] = - 7.20[- 12.57, - 1.82], p = 0.009) had a significant improvement
      in executive function when compared with controls. There was no statistical
      difference for all scales between long-term (>/= 12 weeks) CPAP treatment group
      and control group. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of CPAP on cognitive improvement
      in patients with OSA is limited, although good adherence to CPAP can mildly
      benefit executive function with short-term effectiveness.

TI  - Handgrip strength is associated with adverse outcomes in patients hospitalized
      for COVID-19-associated pneumonia.
LID - 10.1007/s11739-022-03060-3 [doi]
AB  - Handgrip strength (HGS), a simple tool for the evaluation of muscular strength,
      is independently associated with negative prognosis in many diseases. It is
      unknown whether HGS is prognostically relevant in COVID-19. We evaluated the
      ability of HGS to predict clinical outcomes in people with COVID-19-related
      pneumonia. 118 patients (66% men, 63 +/- 12 years), consecutively hospitalized to
      the "Santa Maria" Terni University Hospital for COVID-19-related pneumonia and
      respiratory failure, underwent HGS measurement (Jamar hand-dynamometer) at ward
      admission. HGS was normalized to weight(2/3) (nHGS) The main end-point was the
      first occurrence of death and/or endotracheal intubation at 14 days. Twenty-two
      patients reached the main end-point. In the Kaplan-Meyer analysis, the Log rank
      test showed significant differences between subjects with lower than mean HGS
      normalized to weight(2/3) (nHGS) (< 1.32 kg/Kg(2/3)) vs subjects with higher than
      mean nHGS. (p = 0.03). In a Cox-proportional hazard model, nHGS inversely
      predicted the main end-point (hazard ratio, HR = 1.99 each 0.5 kg/Kg(2/3)
      decrease, p = 0.03), independently from age, sex, body mass index, ratio of
      partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2
      ratio), hypertension, diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate and history 
      of previous cardiovascular cardiovascular disease. These two latter also showed
      independent association with the main end-point (HR 1.30, p = 0.03 and 3.89, p < 
      0.01, respectively). In conclusion, nHGS measured at hospital admission,
      independently and inversely predicts the risk of poor outcomes in people with
      COVID-19-related pneumonia. The evaluation of HGS may be useful in early
      stratifying the risk of adverse prognosis in COVID-19.

TI  - Predictors of "brain fog" 1 year after COVID-19 disease.
LID - 10.1007/s10072-022-06285-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Brain fog has been described up to 1 year after SARS-CoV-2
      infection, notwithstanding the underlying mechanisms are still poorly
      investigated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of cognitive
      complaints at 1-year follow-up and to identify the factors related to persistent 
      brain fog in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Out of 246 COVID patients, hospitalized 
      from March 1st to May 31st, a sample of 137 patients accepted to be evaluated at 
      1 year from discharge, through a full clinical, neurological, and psychological
      examination, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), impact of event 
      scale-revised (IES-R), Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS), Zung self-rating 
      anxiety scale (SAS), and fatigue severity scale (FSS). Subjects with prior
      cognitive impairment and/or psychiatric disorders were excluded. RESULTS:
      Patients with cognitive disorders exhibited lower MoCA score (22.9 +/- 4.3 vs.
      26.3 +/- 3.1, p = 0.002) and higher IES-R score (33.7 +/- 18.5 vs. 26.4 +/- 16.3,
      p = 0.050), SDS score (40.9 +/- 6.5 vs. 35.5 +/- 8.6, p = 0.004), and fatigue
      severity scale score (33.6 +/- 16.1 vs. 23.7 +/- 12.5, p = 0.001), compared to
      patients without cognitive complaints. Logistic regression showed a significant
      correlation between brain fog and the self-rating depression scale values (p =
      0.020), adjusted for age (p = 0.445), sex (p = 0.178), premorbid Cumulative
      Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) (p = 0.288), COVID-19 severity (BCRSS) (p = 0.964),
      education level (p = 0.784) and MoCA score (p = 0.909). CONCLUSIONS: Our study
      showed depression as the strongest predictor of persistent brain fog, adjusting
      for demographic and clinical variables. Wider longitudinal studies are warranted 
      to better explain cognitive difficulties after COVID-19.

TI  - Association of dietary proteins with serum creatinine and estimated glomerular
      filtration rate in a general population sample: the CHRIS study.
LID - 10.1007/s40620-022-01409-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is known to affect kidney function. However, population-based
      studies provide contrasting evidence, resulting in a poor understanding of the
      effect of proteins from specific foods on kidney health. METHODS: We analyzed the
      effect of total daily protein intake (TDPI) and source-specific daily protein
      intake (DPI) on fasting serum creatinine (SCr) and estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) in the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) 
      cross-sectional study (n = 5889), using the GA(2)LEN food frequency questionnaire
      for TDPI and DPI estimation. We fitted multivariable adjusted mixed models of SCr
      and eGFR on TDPI and DPI quartiles (Q1-Q4) in the overall sample, and after
      removing individuals with known hypertension, diabetes or chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). RESULTS: Higher TDPI as well as DPI from overall animal sources, fish, and
      poultry, were associated with higher SCr (trend test p, ptrend < 0.01), with
      larger effect after excluding individuals with known hypertension, diabetes or
      CKD. The eGFR was lower at higher TDPI (Q4 vs Q1: - 1.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2); 95% CI 
      - 2.5, - 0.7; ptrend = 3e-4) and DPI from fish (Q4 vs Q1: - 2.1 ml/min/1.73 m(2);
      95% CI - 2.9, - 1.20; ptrend = 4.3e-6), overall animal source (Q4 vs Q1: - 1.6
      ml/min/1.73 m(2); 95% CI -2.5, - 0.8), processed meat (Q4 vs Q1: - 1.4
      ml/min/1.73 m(2); ptrend = 0.027), red meat, offal and processed meat (Q4 vs Q1: 
      - 1.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2); ptrend = 0.015) and poultry (Q4 vs Q1: - 0.9 ml/min/1.73 
      m(2); ptrend = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: TDPI and DPI from specific animal sources
      were positively associated with SCr and negatively associated with eGFR. Lacking 
      an alternative marker of kidney function, confounding involving muscle mass
      metabolism cannot be fully excluded.

TI  - Production and characterization of novel thermo- and organic solvent-stable
      keratinase and aminopeptidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4-3 for effective
      poultry feather degradation.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22367-4 [doi]
AB  - Feather biodegradation is an important premise for efficient resource development
      and utilization, in which keratinase plays an important role. However, there are 
      few keratinases that combine the high activity, thermal stability, and organic
      solvent tolerance required for industrialization. This paper reported an
      efficient feather-degrading Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4-3 isolated from
      slaughterhouses. After 48 h of fermentation by P. aeruginosa 4-3 in a feather
      medium at 40 degrees C, pH 8.0, keratinase was efficiently produced (295.28 +/-
      5.42 U/mL) with complete feather degradation (95.3 +/- 1.5%). Moreover, the
      keratinase from P. aeruginosa 4-3 showed high optimal temperature (55 degrees C),
      good thermal stability, wide pH tolerance, and excellent organic solvent
      resistance. In addition, P. aeruginosa 4-3-derived aminopeptidases also exhibit
      excellent thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance. Encouragingly, the
      reaction of crude keratinase and aminopeptidase with feathers for 8 h resulted in
      a 78% degradation rate of feathers. These properties make P. aeruginosa 4-3
      keratinase and aminopeptidase ideal proteases for potential applications in
      keratin degradation, as well as provide ideas for the synergistic degradation of 
      keratin by multiple enzymes.

TI  - Application of advanced trend analysis techniques with clustering approach for
      analysing rainfall trend and identification of homogenous rainfall regions in
      Delhi metropolitan city.

AB  - In the era of global urbanization, the cities across the world are experiencing
      significant change in the climate pattern. However, analysing the trend and
      pattern of rainfall over the urban areas has a number of challenges such as
      availability of long-term data as well as the uneven distribution of rain-gauge
      stations. In this research, the rainfall regionalization approach has been
      applied along with the advanced statistical techniques for analysing the trend
      and pattern of rainfall in the Delhi metropolitan city. Fuzzy C-means and K-means
      clustering techniques have been applied for the identification of homogeneous
      rainfall regions while innovative trend analysis (ITA) along with the family of
      Mann-Kendall (MK) tests has been applied for the trend analysis of rainfall. The 
      result shows that in all rain-gauge stations of Delhi, an increasing trend in
      rainfall has been recorded during 1991-2018. But the rate of increase was low as 
      the trend slope of ITA and Sen's slope in MK tests are low, which varies between 
      0.03 and 0.05 and 0.01 and 0.16, respectively. Furthermore, none of the
      rain-gauge stations have experienced a monotonic trend in rainfall as the null
      hypothesis has not been rejected (p value > 0.05) for any stations. Furthermore, 
      the study shows that ITA has a better performance than the family of MK tests.
      The findings of this study may be utilized for the urban flood mitigation and
      solving other issues related to water resources in Delhi and other cities.

TI  - Higher dietary total antioxidant capacity is inversely associated with
      Helicobacter pylori infection among adults: A case-control study.
LID - 10.1007/s12664-022-01246-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antioxidants appear to hinder the actions of Helicobacter pylori
      (H. pylori). The aim of this research was to evaluate the association between
      dietary total antioxidant capacity (DTAC) and H. pylori infection. METHODS: A
      case-control study was carried out among 200 patients with H. pylori infection
      and 402 healthy subjects (18-55 years). Dietary data were collected using a
      validated 168-item quantitative food frequency questionnaire. DTAC was calculated
      based on the oxygen radical absorbance capacity of each food (except for coffee) 
      reported by the US Department of Agriculture. RESULTS: Compared with participants
      in the lowest tertile of DTAC, those in the highest tertile had a significantly
      lower odds ratio (OR) in the crude model (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.14-0.61; p for
      trend = 0.001), model 1 (adjustment for age and sex) (OR, 0.37; 95% CI,
      0.24-0.58; p for trend < 0.001), and model 2 (adjustment for model 1 plus body
      mass index, waist circumference, physical activity, smoking, dietary intake of
      energy and fat) (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.10-0.40; p for trend </= 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: A high DTAC is associated with a reduced risk of H. pylori infection
      in adults. Further studies are mandatory to elucidate the mechanisms and a
      dose-effect relationship.

TI  - Pulmonary vein size is associated with reconnection following cryoballoon
      ablation of atrial fibrillation.
LID - 10.1007/s10840-022-01330-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The second-generation cryoballoon (CB) has proven to be a highly
      effective ablative strategy in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation
      (AF). This study sought to investigate the anatomical characteristics of
      pulmonary veins (PVs) and the relationship between their size, ovality, and late 
      reconnections in a large cohort of patients undergoing repeat ablation for
      recurrence of atrial arrhythmias. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 152 consecutive
      patients (98 males, 64.5%; mean age 64.9 +/- 9.6 years) underwent a repeat
      ablation for recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias after a median time of 6.5 months 
      [IQR 11] from the index CB ablation. All repeat ablations were performed using a 
      3-dimensional electro-anatomical mapping system. Among all 593 PVs, 134 (22.6%)
      showed a late PV reconnection in 95 patients (0.88 per patient), at the time of
      repeat ablation procedure. There was a significant difference in ovality between 
      left- and right-sided PVs (p < 0.001). Greater diameters of left superior PV,
      left inferior PV, and right inferior PV ostia (both maximum and minimum) and
      higher index ovality were significantly associated with late PV reconnection.
      CONCLUSIONS: The rate of late PV reconnection after CB ablation was low (0.88
      PVs/patient). Left-sided PVs were more oval than septal PVs. Larger PV dimensions
      and higher ovality index were significantly associated with reconnections in all 
      PVs except for RSPV.

TI  - Comparison of selective coronary angiography through the ablation catheter versus
      conventional coronary angiography to guide ablation of premature ventricular
      contractions originating from aortic cusp.
LID - 10.1007/s10840-022-01324-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraprocedural coronary angiography (CA) is recommended in patients 
      undergoing ablation in aortic cusps to assess the relation of catheter tip and
      coronary ostia. In this report, we aimed to compare selective coronary
      angiography (SCA) through the contact force (CF)-sensing radiofrequency catheter 
      with conventional coronary angiography (CCA) to guide ablation of premature
      ventricular contractions (PVC). METHODS: This was a retrospective observational
      cohort study of prospectively collected data of 87 consecutive patients
      undergoing PVC ablation at a single institution between February 2016 and June
      2021. Forty-six patients (53%) underwent SCA and forty-one patients (47%)
      underwent CCA. Data were consecutively collected case-by-case and entered into a 
      computerized database. Procedural characteristics, complications, and clinical
      outcomes were compared between the SCA and CCA groups. RESULTS: Successful
      ablation was achieved in seventy-seven (89%) patients. Total procedure and
      fluoroscopy time and radiation dose were significantly lower in SCA group (93 +/-
      22 min vs 102 +/- 20 min, p = 0.042; 12 +/- 3 min vs 14 +/- 4 min, p = 0.030;
      3292 +/- 1221 muGy m(2) vs 3880 +/- 1229 muGy m(2), p = 0.028, respectively).
      Median ambulation time was significantly longer in CCA group (6.8 +/- 1 h vs 17.8
      +/- 1.8 h, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Selective coronary angiography through the
      CF-sensing ablation catheter to assess the relation between the ablation site and
      the coronary ostia is feasible and safe. This technique precludes the requirement
      of an additional arterial access and decreases the total procedure and
      fluoroscopy time and radiation dose.

TI  - Effect of Galcanezumab on Total Pain Burden in Patients Who Had Previously Not
      Benefited from Migraine Preventive Medication (CONQUER Trial): A Post Hoc
      Analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s12325-022-02233-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In evaluating therapies for migraine prevention, emphasis is placed
      on frequency and less attention is paid to duration or severity. Total pain
      burden (TPB) combines frequency, duration, and severity of migraine headache, and
      has the potential to further characterize the benefit of preventive treatment
      using a single composite measure. TPB was previously used to characterize
      response to galcanezumab (GMB) in patients with migraine. In this post hoc
      analysis we assessed the impact of GMB in lowering TPB in patients who had
      previously not benefited from two to four categories of migraine preventive
      medication. METHODS: CONQUER trial patients (N = 462), 18-75 years old who had
      previously not benefited from two to four categories of migraine preventive
      medication, were randomized (1:1) to monthly placebo or GMB 120 mg with 240 mg
      loading dose. For each patient, monthly TPB in severity-weighted hours was
      calculated by multiplying migraine headache duration (hours) by maximum severity 
      for each migraine headache day, then summing these daily scores over the month
      for the monthly score. Changes from baseline in monthly TPB across months 1-3
      were analyzed. Spearman correlations between TPB and scores on the
      Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ) total and Migraine
      Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) were assessed at baseline. RESULTS: Mean (SD)
      baseline monthly TPB was 192.1 (158.3) and 188.2 (197.4) severity-weighted hours 
      for GMB-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Across the 3-month
      double-blind period, GMB-treated patients experienced significantly greater mean 
      reductions from baseline in monthly TPB compared with placebo-treated patients,
      both for mean change (GMB - 82.7, placebo - 15.8, p < 0.001) and percentage
      change (GMB - 38.6%, placebo 9.4%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, baseline TPB
      correlated with MSQ score (r = - 0.39) and MIDAS score (r = 0.40), suggesting
      good association of TPB with functional and disability outcomes. CONCLUSION: GMB 
      reduced mean TPB in patients who had previously not benefited from two to four
      categories of migraine preventive medication. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03559257.

TI  - Exercise Self-Efficacy and patient global assessment were associated with 6-min
      walk test distance in persons with rheumatoid arthritis.
LID - 10.1007/s10067-022-06309-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Low functional capacity is related to future loss of daily function
      and cardiovascular events. The present study explored the associations of
      patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and disease-specific measures with
      functional capacity as measured by the 6-min walk test (6MWT) in persons with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Seventy-nine participants from rheumatology
      outpatient clinics were included. The distance walked during the 6MWT (6MWD) was 
      the dependent variable in multivariable regression analyses. Model 1 included the
      independent variables sex, age (in tertiles to improve model fit), and body mass 
      index (BMI). Building on Model 1, Model 2 added smoking, patient global
      assessment (PGA), Exercise Self-Efficacy, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale's
      Depression score, and Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale score, whereas Model 3 added
      smoking, disease duration, present use of glucocorticosteroids, seropositivity,
      Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP), and a comorbidity
      variable. RESULTS: Median age was 65 years, 76% were female, and median 6MWD was 
      493 m. In Model 1, BMI and age were significantly associated with the 6MWD (R(2) 
      = 0.42). In Model 2, PGA and Exercise Self-Efficacy were also significantly
      associated with the 6MWD, with standardized regression coefficients of - 0.21 (p 
      = 0.03) and 0.26 (p = 0.004) respectively (R(2) = 0.54). The RA-specific
      variables in Model 3 were not significantly associated with the 6MWD (R(2) =
      0.49). CONCLUSION: The PROMs PGA and Exercise Self-Efficacy were significantly
      associated with functional capacity as measured by the 6MWT in persons with RA,
      whereas disease-specific measures such as DAS28-CRP and disease duration were
      not. Key Points * Functional capacity measured with the 6-minute walk test was
      significantly associated with body mass index, age, patient global assessment,
      and Exercise Self-Efficacy in persons with RA. * Patient-reported outcome
      measures explained more of the variation in functional capacity than objective or
      composite measures of disease and are relevant measures in clinical follow-up. * 
      Techniques that enhance self-efficacy for exercise should be incorporated into
      clinical practice to promote physical activity.

TI  - Racial Differences in Bariatric Surgical Approach: a Cross-Sectional National
      Inpatient Sample Analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s11695-022-06227-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Although racial inequalities in referral and access to bariatric
      surgical care have been well reported, racial difference in the selection of
      surgical techniques is understudied. This study examined factors associated with 
      the utilization of the two main bariatric surgical techniques: laparoscopic
      sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB).
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample database was queried for
      patients who underwent elective LSG or LRYGB for the treatment of severe obesity.
      Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression assessed associations of
      surgical approach with patient and facility characteristics. Sensitivity analyses
      examined the following body mass index (BMI) subgroups: < 40.0 kg/m(2), 40.0-44.9
      kg/m(2), 45.0-49.9 kg/m(2), and >/= 50.0 kg/m(2). RESULTS: Within the final
      cohort (N = 86,053), 73.0% (N = 62,779) underwent LSG, and 27.0% (N = 23,274)
      underwent LRYGB. Patients with BMI 45.0-49.9 kg/m(2) (OR = 0.85) and BMI >/= 50.0
      kg/m(2) (OR = 0.80) were less likely to undergo LSG than patients with BMI
      40.0-45.0 kg/m(2) (all p < 0.001). However, Black (OR = 1.74) and White Hispanic 
      patients (OR = 1.30) were more likely to undergo LSG than White non-Hispanic
      patients (all p < 0.005). In the BMI >/= 50.0 kg/m(2) group, Black patients were 
      still more likely to undergo LSG compared to White non-Hispanic patients (OR =
      1.69, p < 0.001), while Asians/Pacific Islanders were less likely to receive LSG 
      than White non-Hispanic patients (OR = 0.41, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this
      observational study, we identified racial differences in the selection of common 
      bariatric surgical approaches across various BMI categories. Future
      investigations are warranted to study and to promote awareness of the
      racial/ethnic influence in attitudes on obesity, weight loss, financial support, 
      and surgical risks during bariatric discussions with minorities.

TI  - Effects of using siris (Albizia lebbeck) foliage in the diet of fattening lambs
      on nutrient digestibility, blood and rumen parameters, growth performance, and
      meat quality characteristics.
PG  - 247
LID - 10.1007/s11250-022-03239-y [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of substitution of siris foliage with 
      alfalfa forage in the diet of fattening lambs on digestibility, fermentation, and
      growth performance of fattening lambs. In the present experiment, 27 8-month-old 
      Arabi lambs (31.3 +/- 6) with an initial weight of 28.8 +/- 1.99 kg were used in 
      a completely randomized design. The effect of experimental diets on dry matter
      intake was not significant; however, the diets had a significant effect on the
      intake of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and crude
      protein (P < 0.05). The effect of experimental diets on the apparent
      digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, NDF, ADF, and crude protein was not 
      significant (P < 0.05). Ammonia nitrogen concentration, pH, and a total
      population of ruminal fluid protozoa and blood parameters were not affected by
      experimental diets. Parameters of fattening performance such as feed intake, live
      weight changes, feed conversion ratio, some carcass traits such as mean weight
      and size of carcass parts, and colorimetric indices of muscle tissue in the order
      of fattening lambs were not affected by experimental diets. The use of foliage of
      siris in the diet of fattening lambs as a substitute with part of alfalfa had no 
      adverse effect on the characteristics studied in the present experiment.
      Therefore, siris be recommended as part of the diet of fattening lambs.

TI  - Treatment Planning for Atrial Fibrillation Using Patient-Specific Models Showing 
      the Importance of Fibrillatory-Areas.
LID - 10.1007/s10439-022-03029-5 [doi]
AB  - Computational models have made it possible to study the effect of fibrosis and
      scar on atrial fibrillation (AF) and plan future personalized treatments. Here,
      we study the effect of area available for fibrillatory waves to sustain AF. Then 
      we use it to plan for AF ablation to improve procedural outcomes. CARPentry was
      used to create patient-specific models to determine the association between the
      size of residual contiguous areas available for AF wavefronts to propagate and
      sustain AF [fibrillatory area (FA)] after ablation with procedural outcomes. The 
      FA was quantified in a novel manner accounting for gaps in ablation lines. We
      selected 30 persistent AF patients with known ablation outcomes. We divided the
      atrial surface into five areas based on ablation scar pattern and anatomical
      landmarks and calculated the FAs. We validated the models based on clinical
      outcomes and suggested future ablation lines that minimize the FAs and terminate 
      rotor activities in simulations. We also simulated the effects of three common
      antiarrhythmic drugs. In the patient-specific models, the predicted arrhythmias
      matched the clinical outcomes in 25 of 30 patients (accuracy 83.33%). The average
      largest FA (FAmax) in the recurrence group was 8517 +/- 1444 vs. 6772 +/- 1531
      mm(2) in the no recurrence group (p < 0.004). The final FAs after adding the
      suggested ablation lines in the AF recurrence group reduced the average FAmax
      from 8517 +/- 1444 to 6168 +/- 1358 mm(2) (p < 0.001) and stopped the sustained
      rotor activity. Simulations also correctly anticipated the effect of
      antiarrhythmic drugs in 5 out of 6 patients who used drug therapy post
      unsuccessful ablation (accuracy 83.33%). Sizes of FAs available for AF wavefronts
      to propagate are important determinants for ablation outcomes. FA size in
      combination with computational simulations can be used to direct ablation in
      persistent AF to minimize the critical mass required to sustain recurrent AF.

LID - 10.1007/s10753-022-01715-z [doi]
AB  - Endothelial dysfunction often accompanies sepsis. We aimed to explore the role of
      PCSK9 in septic endothelial dysfunction. Sepsis was induced by lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro and
      cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery in mice in vivo. Evolocumab (EVC) and
      Pep 2-8, PCSK9 inhibitors, were subsequently used to determine the role of PCSK9 
      in sepsis-induced endothelial dysfunction in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In 
      addition, the TLR4 agonist, Kdo2-Lipid A ammonium (KLA), was used to determine
      the related mechanism. Protein expression of eNOS, VE-cadherin, PCSK9, TLR4,
      MyD88, p-p65, p65, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 p20 in mice aortas and HUVECs was
      measured by western blotting, while mRNA expression of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and
      IL-18 was determined by qRT-PCR. The level of inflammatory cytokines of mouse
      aortas was visualized by immunohistochemistry. Vasodilation of the aorta was
      detected by vascular reactivity experiments. The 96-h survival rate after CLP was
      assessed. Our findings showed that the expression of eNOS and VE-cadherin
      decreased, and PCSK9 expression increased, in septic HUVECs or mice. Inhibition
      of PCSK9 increased eNOS and VE-cadherin expression. Activation of the
      TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB and NLRP3 pathways may be responsible for PCSK9-induced
      endothelial dysfunction in sepsis. Vascular reactivity tests and survival studies
      showed that inhibition of PCSK9 could prevent the decrease in
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation function and improve the survival rates of
      septic mice. In summary, our results suggested that increased PCSK9 expression
      during sepsis activated the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB and NLRP3 pathways to induce
      inflammation, which resulted in vascular endothelial dysfunction and decreased
      survival rates. Thus, inhibition of PCSK9 may be a potential clinical therapeutic
      target to improve vascular endothelial function in sepsis.

TI  - The role of hepatic and renal functions in the development of retinopathy of
      prematurity: Is proteinuria a new risk factor?
LID - 10.1007/s10792-022-02445-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the association of hepatic and renal parameters with the 
      development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in premature infants with a
      gestational age </= 32 weeks. METHODS: Medical records of 240 preterm infants
      were reviewed retrospectively, 85 of them were grouped as type 1, type 2 ROP, and
      control group. The 4th week hepatic and renal function test results of the
      groups, on the day of their first ROP examinations, were compared for the risk of
      development of ROP and the development of type 1 ROP. RESULTS: In this study, 12,
      35, and 38 infants were enrolled in the type 1, type 2 ROP, and control group,
      respectively. The average gestational age and birth weight were higher; however, 
      the duration of oxygen treatment was lower in the control group (p < 0.001). The 
      blood glucose level was significantly higher in the type 1 ROP group than in the 
      other groups (p = 0.023). The mean of total serum bilirubin of the type 1 ROP
      group was significantly lower than those of the type 2 ROP and control group (p =
      0.032). Proteinuria was present in 85.7% of preterms with treatment-requiring ROP
      and proteinuria increased the risk of ROP by 3.9 times (OR with 95% CI 3.9
      (1.19-12.75), p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: We found significantly higher blood glucose
      and lower total bilirubin level in the type 1 ROP group. Moreover, our findings
      suggest that proteinuria may not be only a comorbidity factor but also related to
      a higher frequency of ROP and type 1 ROP in preterm infants.

TI  - There is no dose-response relationship between the amount of exercise and
      improvement in HbA1c in interventions over 12 weeks in patients with type 2
      diabetes: a meta-analysis and meta-regression.
LID - 10.1007/s00592-022-01918-8 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Aerobic exercise is well recognised as an effective treatment for people
      with type 2 diabetes but the optimal amount of aerobic exercise to improve
      glycaemic control remains to be determined. Thus, the aim of this meta-analysis
      and meta-regression was to assess the impact of volume and intensity of aerobic
      exercise on glycaemic control. METHODS: Medline, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of
      Science databases were searched up until 15 December 2020 for the terms "aerobic 
      exercise AND glycaemic control", "type 2 diabetes AND exercise", and "exercise
      AND glycaemic control AND Type 2 diabetes AND randomised control trial". We
      included (i) randomised control trials of >/= 12 weeks, (ii) trials where
      participants had type 2 diabetes and were aged 18 or over, and (iii) the trial
      reported HbA1c concentrations pre- and post-intervention. Two reviewers selected 
      studies and extracted data. Data are reported as standardised mean difference
      (SMD) and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. RESULTS: A total of
      5364 original titles were identified. Sixteen studies were included in the
      meta-analysis. Aerobic exercise reduced HbA1c versus control (SMD = 0.56 (95% CI 
      0.3-0.82), p < 0.001). There were also significant reductions in BMI (SMD = 0.76 
      (95% CI 0.25-1.27), p < 0.05). There was no dose-response relationship between
      improvement in HbA1c and the intensity and volume of the intervention (p > 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Twelve-week or longer aerobic exercise programmes improve glycaemic 
      control and BMI in adults with type 2 diabetes. Longer or more intense
      interventions appear to confer no additional benefit on HbA1c.

TI  - A quantitative and qualitative assessment of microplastics collected at two
      public beaches along the east and south-east coast of Mauritius.
PG  - 640
LID - 10.1007/s10661-022-10269-4 [doi]
AB  - Microplastics had been collected at two sites namely Trou d'eau Douce (TD) and La
      Cambuse (LC) public beaches, lying in the east coast and south-east coast of
      Mauritius, respectively, over 6 months from September 2019 to February 2020. The 
      sizes of the latter varied from 180 microm to 4 mm. A higher amount of
      microplastics collected/6-kg sand sample was recorded at LC. Two-way ANOVA
      revealed that (1) there was a considerable gap in the variability regarding
      quantity and size distribution of microplastics on the two beaches. The post-hoc 
      analysis showed that the majority of the microplastics at LC were > 1.40 mm,
      whereas the smaller plastic fragments < 1.40 mm were more dominant at TD. (2)
      There was a significant interaction between location and event (p value = 0.025).
      The post-hoc analysis showed that the torrential rain hitting the island prior to
      sampling week 7 had decreased the microplastic counts at both TD and LC, but not 
      significantly. Interestingly, the two hurricanes, prior to weeks 8 and 9, had
      appreciably reduced the microplastic counts at TD and, on the other hand, there
      was an increase in the amount of microplastics at LC, but not to a significant
      effect. The chemical nature (qualitative analysis) of microplastics was
      determined by density flotation and FTIR spectroscopy. Microplastics at TD were
      exclusively high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in origin, whereas, at LC,
      microplastics were both HDPE and polypropylene (PP) in origin.

      biopsy.
LID - 10.1007/s00345-022-04104-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare infectious complications after transrectal systematic
      prostate biopsy (SB) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy (TB) in
      a large retrospective cohort to assess whether one technique is superior to the
      other regarding infectious complications. METHODS: A total of 4497 patients
      underwent 5288 biopsies, 2875 (54%) SB and 2413 (46%) MRI-TB only. On average, 12
      SB cores and 3.7 MRI-TB cores were taken per biopsy session during the study
      period. Infection-related complications within 30 days were compared. The primary
      endpoint was a positive urine culture. Secondary endpoints were positive blood
      cultures, urine tests with elevated leukocytes >/= 100 E6/L and elevated
      C-reactive protein (CRP) >/= 100 mg/L. Chi-square test was used to compare the
      cohorts. RESULTS: Positive urine cultures were found in 77 (2.7%) after SB and in
      42 (1.7%) after MRI-TB (p = 0.022). In total, 46 (0.9%) blood culture positive
      infections were found, 23 (0.9%) occurred after SB and 23 (1.0%) after MRI-TB, (p
      = 0.848). Urine tests with elevated leukocytes >/= 100 E6/L were found in 111
      (3.9%) after SB and in 61 (2.5%) after MRI-TB (p = 0.006). Elevated CRP >/= 100
      mg/L was found in 122 (4.2%) after SB and in 72 (3.0%) after MRI-TB (p = 0.015). 
      Blood cultures were drawn more often after SB than after MRI-TB, but the
      difference was not statistically significant. However, urine cultures and CRP
      were taken more often after SB than MRI-TB. CONCLUSION: Blood culture positive
      infections were equally rare after SB and MRI-TB. However, all other infectious
      complications were more common after SB than MRI-TB.

AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to characterize the distribution of energy and macronutrient
      intakes across eating occasions (EO) in European children from preschool to
      school age. METHODS: Data from 3-day weighed food records were collected from
      children at ages 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 years from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland and 
      Spain. Food intakes were assigned to EO based on country-specific daytimes for
      breakfast, lunch, supper and snacks (morning, afternoon). The average energy and 
      nutrient intakes were expressed as percentage of total energy intake (%E).
      Nutrients were additionally expressed as percentage per EO (%EEO). Foods were
      assigned to food groups; variation in intake was calculated via coefficient of
      variation (CV). We analyzed age trends in diurnal intake using mixed-effects beta
      regression. RESULTS: The 740 healthy children included in the analysis consumed
      the largest proportion of daily energy at lunch (31%E +/- 8, M +/- SD) and supper
      (26%E +/- 8), followed by breakfast (19%E +/- 7) and snacks [afternoon (16%E +/- 
      8); morning (8%E +/- 7)], with the most variable intake at morning snack (CV =
      0.9). The nutrient composition at lunch and supper was highest for fat (36 +/-
      9%ELunch; 39 +/- 11%ESupper) and protein (18 +/- 5%ELunch; 18 +/- 6%ESupper) and 
      at breakfast and snacks for carbohydrates (54 +/- 12%EBreakfast; 62 +/-
      12%ESnacks). High-sugar content foods were consumed in relatively large
      proportions at breakfast and snacks. Food intakes varied significantly with age, 
      with lower snack intakes at later ages (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Possibly
      unhealthy EOs with high-fat intakes and high-sugar-content foods were observed.
      Changes in nutrient composition of EOs may be beneficial for health. TRIAL

TI  - Transcriptomic Analysis of the Liver and Brain in Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon
      idella) Under Heat Stress.
LID - 10.1007/s10126-022-10148-6 [doi]
AB  - Temperature is a major environmental factor that influences growth, development, 
      metabolism, and physiological performance in fish. Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon
      idella) is a highly productive fish in freshwater culture. To understand the
      molecular mechanism of grass carp under heat stress, we used RNA-Seq to analyze
      the liver and brain transcriptome of 12 libraries constructed from
      high-temperature (36 degrees C) and control (28 degrees C) groups. We obtained
      42.49 and 42.57 GB of clean data from six liver and six brain libraries,
      respectively, and identified 2,534 genes that were differentially expressed in
      liver tissue and 1622 in brain tissue (P < 0.05). According to KEGG analysis,
      significant differences occurred in the expression of genes involved in metabolic
      and immune pathways, such as the cAMP signaling pathway, apoptosis, calcium
      signaling pathway, lipid metabolism, and protein processing in endoplasmic
      reticulum and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathways. This
      study revealed that high temperature enhanced lipid metabolism, reduced fatty
      acid synthesis, and disrupted the immune system of grass carp. These results
      investigated the molecular regulation of heat stress in grass carp and provided
      valuable information for the healthy culture of grass carp under high
      temperatures.

TI  - Impact of stem profile on the revisability and the need for osteotomy in
      well-fixed cemented revision total knee arthroplasty implants.
LID - 10.1007/s00402-022-04559-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: While re-revision total knee arthroplasty (ReRTKA) steadily
      increases, the ease and bone-sparing removal of RTKA implants is gaining more and
      more in importance. Biomechanical data suggest that cemented conical stems can be
      removed significantly easier than cylindrical stems. However, no clinical
      evidence exists supporting this observation. Aim of this study was to compare the
      revisability and need for osteotomy (OT) between removals of well-fixed cemented 
      conical vs. cylindrical RTKA stems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 55 removals of
      well-fixed full-cemented RTKA stems (29 knees) performed between 2016 and 2018
      were retrospectively analyzed. Main outcome variables were: bone loss, fractures,
      osteotomy incidence, surgery duration, early postoperative complications (EPC),
      hemoglobin drop and blood transfusion. SPSS was used for the statistical
      analysis. RESULTS: 44.8% were conical, 48.3% cylindrical, and 6.9% combined stem 
      designs. Causes for re-revision were PJI (75.9%), malposition (17.2%) and
      persistent pain (6.9%). 10 stem removals (18.2%) required an OT (four femoral,
      six tibial): eight stems (14.5%) had cylindrical and two (3.6%) conical designs
      (P = 0.041). Fractures were noted solely in removals without OT (11.1% vs. 0%,). 
      There was a tendency to more bone loss in cylindrical stem revisions (53.8% vs.
      32%, P = 0.24). A longer overall surgery time was observed in revisions of
      cylindrical stems (+ 37 min, P = 0.05). There was higher hemoglobin drop and need
      for blood transfusion in revisions of cylindrical stems or after OT but without
      reaching statistical significance. The EPC rates were slightly higher in ReRTKA
      on cylindrical stems (P = 0.28). CONCLUSION: Well-fixed cemented conical stems
      may be revision friendlier with less demands on OT and shorter overall surgery
      time than cemented cylindrical stems.

TI  - Less improvement in knee function and higher rates of dissatisfaction in the
      short-term following total knee arthroplasty in people with mild radiographic
      arthritis.
LID - 10.1007/s00402-022-04564-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess if severity of radiographic
      changes of knee arthritis was associated with patient improvement after total
      knee arthroplasty (TKA). We hypothesised that patients with mild arthritis were
      more likely to report lower satisfaction, improvement in knee function and Oxford
      knee score (OKS) compared to patients with moderate or severe arthritis.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from
      TKA patients of two arthroplasty centres with knee radiographs available for
      assessment of disease severity. Patients completed the Oxford knee score (OKS)
      and were asked to rate the global improvement in knee condition and their
      satisfaction at 6 months post-TKA. Bivariable analysis and multivariable
      regression models were used to test the association between disease severity and 
      each outcome. RESULTS: 2226 patients underwent primary TKA and 3.6% had mild
      arthritis. Mean OKS improved from 17.0 (SD 18.0) to 38.0 (SD 8.1) 6 months after 
      TKA. Two hundred and twenty-two patients (10%) reported 'Poor' or 'Fair'
      satisfaction, and 173 (8%) reported knee function was 'Much worse', 'A little
      worse' or 'About the same' 6 months post-TKA. Patients with mild arthritis showed
      improvement in OKS [mean improvement in OKS = 19 (SD 15)], but were significantly
      more likely to report dissatisfaction (OR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.62 to 5.91, p =
      0.006), lack of improvement (OR = 4.49, 95% CI 2.38 to 8.47, p < 0.001) and lower
      OKS scores (- 3 points, 95% CI - 5.39 to - 0.85, p = 0.008) compared to patients 
      with moderate to severe arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: While patients with mild
      radiographic arthritic changes improve after TKA, they were significantly more
      likely to report higher rates of dissatisfaction, less improvement in knee
      function and OKS compared to patients with moderate-severe grades of arthritis.

TI  - Improvement in bladder function in children with functional constipation after a 
      bowel management program.
LID - 10.1007/s00383-022-05157-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to determine if children with functional constipation (FC)
      would have an improvement in bladder function with treatment of constipation with
      a bowel management program (BMP). METHODS: A single-institution review was
      performed in children aged 3-18 with FC who underwent a BMP from 2014 to 2020.
      Clinical characteristics, bowel management details, and the Vancouver Symptom
      Score for Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome (VSS), Baylor Continence Scale
      (BCS), and Cleveland Clinic Constipation Score (CCCS) were collected. Data were
      analyzed using linear mixed effect modeling with random intercept. RESULTS: 241
      patients were included with a median age of 9 years. Most were White 81 and 47%
      were female. Univariate tests showed improvement in VSS (- 3.6, P < 0.0001), BCS 
      (- 11.96, P < 0.0001), and CCCS (- 1.9, P < 0.0001) among patients having
      undergone one BMP. Improvement was noted in VSS and CCCS among those with more
      than one BMP (VSS: - 1.66, P = 0.023; CCCS: - 2.69, P < 0.0001). Multivariate
      tests indicated undergoing a BMP does result in significant improvement in VSS,
      BCS, and CCCS (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There is significant improvement in
      bladder function in children with FC who undergo a BMP. For patients with bowel
      and bladder dysfunction and FC, a BMP is a reasonable treatment strategy for
      lower urinary tract symptoms.

TI  - Genetic diversity in peridomiciliary populations of Triatoma mexicana (Hemiptera:
      Reduviidae: Triatominae) in central Mexico.
LID - 10.1007/s00436-022-07608-2 [doi]
AB  - Triatoma mexicana is an important vector of Trypanosoma cruzi-the etiological
      agent of Chagas disease. This triatomine species occurs in central Mexico, but
      little is known about its genetic variability. Using Cyt-b gene as a genetic
      marker, in this study, we determined the population genetic structure of T.
      mexicana collected from the States of Hidalgo, Guanajuato, and Queretaro where
      populations are largely peridomiciliary. A Bayesian approach was performed for
      the design of phylogenies, median-joining networks, and clustering among
      populations of T. mexicana. Our results show that the Hidalgo population was the 
      most distinct, with the highest genetic and haplotypic variation (Hd = 0.963, pi 
      = 0.06129, and = 0.05469). Moderate gene flow (Nm) was determined among
      populations of Hidalgo and Queretaro. Populations from the three states showed
      differentiation (FST) values ranging from 0.22 to 0.3, suggesting an important
      genetic differentiation. The phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of five
      well-defined groups, as well as the haplotype network, where 24 haplotypes were
      observed forming five haplogroups with high mutational steps among them: 68
      (Hgo-W2), 26 (Qto), 59 (Hgo-M), 44 (Hgo-W1), and 46 (Gto). Genetic isolation was 
      apparently inferred in the Guanajuato population; however, the Mantel test did
      not show correlation between genetic (FST) and geographic (km) distances (p =
      0.05). The STRUCTURE analyses showed seven genetic clusters and it was observed
      that a single cluster predominates in each sampled location. However, genetic
      admixture was detected in four localities. Our results show evidence that there
      are multiple species within the collected sampling area.

TI  - Three semi-selective media for Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola and P.
      cannabina pv. alisalensis.
LID - 10.1007/s00253-022-12092-w [doi]
AB  - Three semi-selective media, DTarTA, SPbc, and SPamt, were developed and tested to
      isolate Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (Psm) and P. cannabina pv.
      alisalensis (Pca) from Raphanus sativus seeds. DTarTA contained D-tartaric acid
      as a carbon source and potassium tellurite, ampicillin sodium, and methyl violet 
      as antibiotics. DTarTA suppressed growth in 19 of the 24 pathovars from the P.
      syringae complex, whereas Psm and Pca grew and formed gray to black colonies.
      SPamt contained sucrose and peptone as nutrient sources and was supplemented with
      bromothymol blue and the same antibiotics present in DTarTA and Psm and Pca
      formed yellowish to dark brown colonies on the SPamt medium. SPbc contained
      sucrose and peptone and was supplemented with cephalexin and boric acid as
      antibiotics and Psm and Pca formed semi-translucent to white colonies on the SPbc
      medium. SPamt and SPbc suppressed the growth of several plant-associated bacteria
      (except the P. syringae complex). The growth of saprophytic bacteria in seeds on 
      the different media was compared with that on King's B medium, using five types
      of commercially available Raphanus sativus seeds. The suppression rate of DTarTA 
      was 85-99% and was lower for seeds with more saprophytic bacteria. The
      suppression rates of SPamt and SPbc were 90-99%. In detection tests using 10,000 
      seed samples mixed with Pca or Psm-contaminated seeds, it was possible to
      selectively isolate Psm and Pca using SPamt and SPbc, even when the colony
      numbers of the target bacterium constituted less than 10% of the total colonies. 
      KEY POINTS: * Bacterial leaf spot and blight pathogens were selectively isolated 
      from seeds. * DTarTA medium distinguishes these pathogens from P. syringae
      complex pathovars. * SPamp and SPbc media have different selectivity for
      plant-associated bacteria.

TI  - [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: first
      clinical experience from a pilot study including biodistribution and dose
      estimates.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-022-05925-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted PET/CT has become
      increasingly important in the management of prostate cancer, especially in
      localization of biochemical recurrence (BCR). PSMA-targeted PET/CT imaging with
      long-lived radionuclides as (89)Zr (T1/2 = 78.4 h) may improve diagnostics by
      allowing data acquisition on later time points. In this study, we present our
      first clinical experience including preliminary biodistribution and dosimetry
      data of [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in patients with BCR of prostate cancer.
      METHODS: Seven patients with BCR of prostate cancer who revealed no (n = 4) or
      undetermined (n = 3) findings on [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging were referred 
      to [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT. PET/CT imaging was performed 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 
      72 h post injection (p.i.) of 111 +/- 11 MBq [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 (mean +/-
      standard deviation). Normal organ distribution and dosimetry were determined.
      Lesions visually considered as suggestive of prostate cancer were quantitatively 
      analyzed. RESULTS: Intense physiological uptake was observed in the salivary and 
      lacrimal glands, liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine and urinary tract. The parotid
      gland received the highest absorbed dose (0.601 +/- 0.185 mGy/MBq), followed by
      the kidneys (0.517 +/- 0.125 mGy/MBq). The estimated overall effective dose for
      the administration of 111 MBq was 10.1 mSv (0.0913 +/- 0.0118 mSv/MBq). In 6
      patients, and in particular in 3 of 4 patients with negative [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11
      PET/CT, at least one prostate cancer lesion was detected in [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617
      PET/CT imaging at later time points. The majority of tumor lesions were first
      visible at 24 h p.i. with continuously increasing tumor-to-background ratio over 
      time. All tumor lesions were detectable at 48 h and 72 h p.i. CONCLUSION:
      [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT imaging is a promising new diagnostic tool with
      acceptable radiation exposure for patients with prostate cancer especially when
      [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging fails detecting recurrent disease. The long
      half-life of (89)Zr enables late time point imaging (up to 72 h in our study)
      with increased tracer uptake in tumor lesions and higher tumor-to-background
      ratios allowing identification of lesions non-visible on [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11
      PET/CT imaging.

TI  - THE ROLE OF MANGANESE IN VERY LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS.
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000003582 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: High manganese (Mn) levels during fetal growth or prolonged parenteral
      nutrition (PN) may have adverse effects on neurodevelopment. We aim to report on 
      Mn levels and their short term impact on clinical course in very low birth weight
      infants. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study including newborns with a
      gestational age (GA) </=32 weeks and/or </=1500g of birth weight (BW). Newborns
      received intravenous supplementation of Mn at 1 microg/kg/day (Peditrace(R)) in
      PN and continued with fortified breast milk. Mothers answered surveys about
      dietary and other habits and blood levels of Mn in newborns were analyzed at days
      1,15 and 30 of life. Associations of Mn levels with mothers' and newborns' data
      were evaluated and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: 160 premature
      infants were recruited. Median blood Mn levels at birth were 43.0 and 24.5
      microg/L at day 30. No important association with mothers' data was found. Median
      (IQR) duration of PN was 8 days (7-14). A prolonged PN and late oral feeding
      showed a non-significant association with lower blood Mn levels at day 30 (P =
      .010, P threshold .003). Mn levels at day 15 and 30 were associated with
      increasing GA (P < .001). Low Mn was not a significant predictor of adverse
      outcomes such as retinopathy of prematurity, bronchodysplasia or respiratory
      distress syndrome after adjusting for potential confounders and multiple testing.
      CONCLUSIONS: Mn showed lower levels with decreasing GA and prolonged PN. Using a 
      low Mn PN solution may not raise blood Mn levels in premature infants.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis reveals crosstalk between gut microbiota and
      glucose-lowering drugs targeting the gastrointestinal tract in Chinese patients
      with type 2 diabetes: a 6 month, two-arm randomised trial.
LID - 10.1007/s00125-022-05768-5 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The use of oral glucose-lowering drugs, particularly those
      designed to target the gut ecosystem, is often observed in association with
      altered gut microbial composition or functional capacity in individuals with type
      2 diabetes. The gut microbiota, in turn, plays crucial roles in the modulation of
      drug efficacy. We aimed to assess the impacts of acarbose and vildagliptin on
      human gut microbiota and the relationships between pre-treatment gut microbiota
      and therapeutic responses. METHODS: This was a randomised, open-labelled, two-arm
      trial in treatment-naive type 2 diabetes patients conducted in Beijing between
      December 2016 and December 2017. One hundred participants with overweight/obesity
      and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were recruited from the Pinggu Hospital and
      randomly assigned to the acarbose (n=50) or vildagliptin (n=50) group using
      sealed envelopes. The treatment period was 6 months. Blood, faecal samples and
      visceral fat data from computed tomography images were collected before and after
      treatments to measure therapeutic outcomes and gut microbiota. Metagenomic
      datasets from a previous type 2 diabetes cohort receiving acarbose or glipizide
      for 3 months were downloaded and processed. Statistical analyses were applied to 
      identify the treatment-related changes in clinical variables, gut microbiota and 
      associations. RESULTS: Ninety-two participants were analysed. After 6 months of
      acarbose (n=44) or vildagliptin (n=48) monotherapy, both groups achieved
      significant reductions in HbA1c (from 60 to 46 mmol/mol [from 7.65% to 6.40%] in 
      the acarbose group and from 59 to 44 mmol/mol [from 7.55% to 6.20%] in the
      vildagliptin group) and visceral fat areas (all adjusted p values for pre-post
      comparisons <0.05). Both arms showed drug-specific and shared changes in relative
      abundances of multiple gut microbial species and pathways, especially the common 
      reductions in Bacteroidetes species. Three months and 6 months of
      acarbose-induced changes in microbial composition were highly similar in type 2
      diabetes patients from the two independent studies. Vildagliptin treatment
      significantly enhanced fasting active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels.
      Baseline gut microbiota, rather than baseline GLP-1 levels, were strongly
      associated with GLP-1 response to vildagliptin, and to a lesser extent with GLP-1
      response to acarbose. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study reveals common
      microbial responses in type 2 diabetes patients treated with two glucose-lowering
      drugs targeting the gut differently and acceptable performance of baseline gut
      microbiota in classifying individuals with different GLP-1 responses to
      vildagliptin. Our findings highlight bidirectional interactions between gut
      microbiota and glucose-lowering drugs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - A Single-Center Prospective Observational Study Investigating the Accuracy of
      Preoperative Diagnostic Procedures in the Assessment of Lymph Node Metastases in 
      Nonfunctioning Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005615 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of preoperative imaging, including
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and
      68Gallium-DOTATOC positron emission tomography (68Ga-DOTATOC PET), in identifying
      nodal metastases (N+) in sporadic nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
      (NF-PanNETs). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: An accurate preoperative identification of
      N+ in NF-PanNETs is critical for surgical planning. The accuracy of different
      imaging techniques in detecting lymph node (LN) metastases in NF-PanNETs has been
      poorly investigated. METHODS: All consecutive patients undergoing surgery for
      sporadic NF-PanNETs (2018-2021) were enrolled in a prospective study (DETECTYON; 
      NCT03918759). The accuracy of preoperative imaging techniques in detecting N+ was
      assessed through sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive
      values (NPV). RESULTS: Overall, 100 patients with NF-PanNETs underwent CE-CT, EUS
      and 68Ga-DOTATOC-PET before pancreatic resection. LN metastases were found in 42 
      cases (42%). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of different imaging
      techniques were 26%, 95%, 79%, 64% for CE-CT, 19%, 98%, 89%, 63% for EUS and 12%,
      95%, 63%, 60% for 68Ga-DOTATOC-PET, respectively. Radiological tumor size >4 cm
      and the presence of radiological N+ at >/=1 imaging were independent predictors
      of N+ at pathology. The identification of N+ at >/=1 imaging technique was
      associated with a higher number of positive LNs compared to negative imaging (4
      vs. 2) (P=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: CE-CT, EUS and 68Ga-DOTATOC-PET are poorly
      sensitive in predicting nodal status in NF-PanNETs despite a high specificity.

TI  - Microsatellite instability and oncological outcomes in Thai patients with
      endometrial cancer.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/01443615.2022.2106557 [doi]
AB  - Here, we determined the frequency of microsatellite instability (MSI) and the
      impact of MSI-high (MSI-H) on clinical outcomes of Thai patients with endometrial
      cancer (EC). Tissue samples of 110 Thai patients with EC, who had undergone
      surgical staging, were tested for mismatch repair (MMR) gene deficiency, and the 
      patients were grouped into MSI-H and MSI-stable (MSI-S) groups; 24.5% had MSI-H. 
      Unlike MSI-S group patients, MSI-H group patients had synchronous and
      metachronous cancer. They showed better 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) than
      those in the MSI-S group (p=.182; 92.3% vs. 82.6%). The 3-year overall survival
      was 96.2% in MSI-H and 86.4% in MSI-S groups (p=.163). Multivariate analyses
      showed lower uterine involvement (p=.004), myometrial invasion >/=50% (p=.032),
      lymphovascular space invasion (p<.001) and MSI-S (p=.006) as prognostic factors
      for DFS. Our study showed that the prevalence of MMR gene deficiency in Thai
      patients with EC is common and associated with better outcomes.Impact
      StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Microsatellite instability (MSI) 
      occurs in approximately 20-40% of endometrial cancer (EC) cases. MSI analysis in 
      EC can identify patients at higher risk of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal
      cancer and those having prognostic factors. Additionally, it is predictive of
      immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. However, current evidence shows a
      correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and EC prognosis. Studies
      on EC and MSI status effect on survival outcome have yielded inconsistent results
      regarding the pathological significance of MSI in such malignancies.What do the
      results of this study add? The prevalence of mismatch repair (MMR) gene
      deficiency in Thai patients with EC is common (24.5%) and associated with better 
      outcomes.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or
      further research? This study highlights the prevalence and impact of MSI on
      oncological outcomes in patients with EC in a low-incidence country. Future
      studies should focus on the detection of germline mutation to understand the
      accurate prevalence of Lynch syndrome in Thai patients with EC.

TI  - The Efficacy of Radiation is Enhanced by Metformin and Hyperthermia Alone or
      Combined Against FSaII Fibrosarcoma in C3H Mice.
PG  - 190-199
LID - 10.1667/RADE-21-00231.1 [doi]
AB  - The effects of mild-temperature hyperthermia (MTH) and metformin, alone or in
      combination, on the efficacy of high-dose hypofractionated radiation against
      experimental tumors were investigated. FSaII fibrosarcoma grown subcutaneously in
      the hind legs of C3H mice was irradiated with a single 15 Gy dose using a 60Co
      irradiator. The radio frequency capacitive method was used to heat the tumors at 
      41.0 degrees C for 30 min. Metformin was intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered
      daily to tumor-bearing mice at a dose of 150 mg/kg. The expression levels of
      hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF), and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) were determined by
      immunohistochemical staining of the excised tumor tissues. The apoptosis of tumor
      cells in vivo was quantified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick
      end labeling (TUNEL) staining and cleaved caspase-3 staining of the excised tumor
      tissues. Irradiation of tumors markedly increased the expression of HIF-1alpha,
      VEGF, and PD-L1, and MTH and metformin used either alone or in combination
      significantly abrogated the radiation-induced upregulation of these proteins. MTH
      and metformin alone or combined increased the radiation-induced apoptosis in
      tumor cells and enhanced the radiation-induced suppression of tumor growth. The
      findings indicated that the increased tumor response to 15 Gy irradiation by MTH 
      and metformin alone or in combination was due, in part, to the abrogation of the 
      radiation-induced upregulation of HIF-1alpha and its downstream targets VEGF and 
      PD-L1.

      behaviour, being extremely aggressive in most cases but more indolent at times.
      We hypothesized that the integrative genomic and gene expression characterization
      of a PC GC series could help identifying molecular subtypes with potential
      clinical implications. METHODS: 64 PC GCs were assessed for alterations in 409
      genes and 30 cases were subjected to transcriptomic profiling of 20,815 genes.
      RESULTS: A median of 8.2 mutations per Mb (IQR 6.9-10.4) was found and a tumor
      mutational load >10 muts/Mb was significantly associated with patients' worse
      survival (P=0.0024). The most frequent mutated genes were CDH1 and TP53 (each
      32.8%) followed by PIK3CA (10.9%). In 15 samples (23.4%), at least one chromatin 
      remodelling gene was mutated: KMT2D (5 cases); ARID1A and BAP1 (4 cases each);
      EZH2, KMT2A, PBRM1 (1 case each). Eight samples (12.5%) had fusion genes
      involving CLDN18 gene. Gene expression profiling identified 4 different clusters:
      cluster A associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature;
      cluster B associated to proliferative signature and EMT; cluster C correlated to 
      hedgehog signalling; cluster D showing no enrichment for any of the previous
      signatures. Notably, cluster A and B showed a worse prognosis compared with
      clusters C and D (P=0.0095). CONCLUSION: integrated genomic and transcriptomic
      analysis suggest the existence of 4 molecular subtypes of PC GC with prognostic
      significance where EMT features are associated with a worse outcome.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in families with four or more affected first-degree
      relatives.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1080/00365521.2022.2106153 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Family history increases the risk for inflammatory bowel diseases
      (IBDs). However, data on differences in phenotypic characteristics among patients
      with a strong family history of IBD are scarce and controversial. The aim of the 
      study was to compare the phenotypic features of IBD patients with four or more
      affected first-degree relatives with sporadic cases of IBD. METHODS: Patients
      with familial and sporadic IBD were identified from the institutional IBD
      database. IBD patients from families with at least four first-degree affected
      relatives were selected for analysis and were compared to non-matched sporadic
      cases with IBD chosen randomly. Comparison for type of IBD (Crohn's disease (CD) 
      vs. ulcerative colitis (UC)), age at onset as well as for disease extent,
      behavior, extraintestinal manifestations and indicators of severe disease were
      analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with familial IBD (28 CD, seven UC) were 
      compared to 88 sporadic IBD patients (61 CD, 24 UC and three IBDU). Disease
      duration was 10.3 +/- 8.2 in the familial and 8.0 +/- 7.2 years in the sporadic
      cases, p=.13. The familial cases were younger at diagnosis (19.3 +/- 8.6 vs. 25.7
      +/- 11.8, p=.004). Patients with familial compared to sporadic IBD were
      significantly more likely to require steroid treatment (80% vs. 54.5%, p=.009),
      biological treatment (94.3%, vs. 63.6%, p<.001) or surgery (25.7%, vs. 11.4%,
      p=.048). CONCLUSIONS: IBD with a very strong positive family history is
      associated with younger age at onset and a more adverse IBD phenotype compared to
      sporadic IBD.

TI  - A randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study of high-dose vitamin C plus 
      FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab versus FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab in unresectable untreated
      metastatic colorectal cancer.
LID - CCR-22-0655 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-0655 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of high-dose vitamin C plus FOLFOX
      +/- bevacizumab versus FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab as first-line treatment in patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2017 and 
      2019, histologically confirmed mCRC patients (n = 442) with normal
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase status and no prior treatment for metastatic
      disease were randomized (1:1) into a control (FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab) and an
      experimental (high-dose vitamin C [1.5 g/kg/d, intravenously for 3 hours from D1 
      to D3] plus FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab) group. Randomization was based on the primary
      tumor location and bevacizumab prescription. RESULTS: The progression-free
      survival (PFS) of the experimental group was not superior to the control group
      (median PFS, 8.6 vs 8.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.70-1.05; P = 0.1). The objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival
      (OS) of the experimental and control group were similar (ORR, 44.3% vs 42.1%; P =
      0.9; median OS, 20.7 vs 19.7 months; P = 0.7). Grade 3 or higher
      treatment-related adverse events occurred in 33.5% and 30.3% of patients in the
      experimental and control group, respectively. In prespecified subgroup analyses, 
      patients with RAS mutation had significantly longer PFS (median PFS, 9.2 vs 7.8
      months; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50-0.91; P = 0.01) with vitamin C added to
      chemotherapy than with chemotherapy only. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose vitamin C plus
      chemotherapy failed to show superior PFS compared with chemotherapy in mCRC
      patients as first-line treatment but may be beneficial in mCRC patients harboring
      RAS mutation.

      Cellana toreuma.
LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.005470 [doi]
AB  - A novel bacterium, designated strain JHSY0214(T), was isolated from the gut of a 
      Korean limpet, Cellana toreuma. Cells of strain JHSY0214(T) were
      Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, yellow-pigmented, non-spore-forming,
      non-motile and showed a rod-coccus growth cycle. Phylogenetic analysis based on
      16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the strain belonged to the genus
      Parasphingorhabdus, and was most closely related to Parasphingorhabdus litoris
      KCTC 12764(T) (98.71 %). Strain JHSY0214(T) had two fluoroquinolone-resistance
      genes and seven multidrug-resistance efflux pump genes, but did not have
      beta-lactamase genes and zinc resistance genes compared with P. litoris KCTC
      12764(T). Strain JHSY0214(T) grew optimally at 30 degrees C, pH 7.0 and in the
      presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. The predominant cellular fatty acids of strain
      JHSY0214(T) were summed feature 8 (C18 : 1 omega6c and/or C18 : 1 omega7c; 41.2
      %), summed feature 3 (C16 : 1 omega7c and/or C16 : 1 omega6c; 21 %) and C16 : 0
      (18.9 %). The major isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-10. The major polar lipids 
      were sphingoglycolipid and phosphatidylethanolamine. The genomic DNA G+C content 
      was 52.8 mol%. Based on phylogenetic, genotypic and phenotypic data, strain
      JHSY0214(T) represents a novel species of the genus Parasphingorhabdus, for which
      the name Parasphingorhabdus cellanae is proposed. The type strain is JHSY0214(T) 
      (=KCTC 82387(T)=DSM 112279(T)).

TI  - Preoperative Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Cryoneurolysis for the Treatment of
      Pain following Mastectomy: A Randomized, Participant- and Observer-Masked,
      Sham-Controlled Study.
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000004334 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND.: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryoneurolysis is an analgesic
      technique in which a percutaneous probe is used to reversibly ablate a peripheral
      nerve(s) using exceptionally low temperature, and has yet to be evaluated with
      randomized, controlled trials. Pain following mastectomy can be difficult to
      treat, and we hypothesized that the severity of surgically-related pain would be 
      lower on postoperative day 2 with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with 
      patients receiving solely standard-of-care treatment. METHODS.: Preoperatively,
      participants at 1 enrolling center received a single injection ropivacaine 0.5%
      paravertebral nerve block at T3 or T4 and a perineural was catheter inserted.
      Participants subsequently had an active or sham ultrasound-guided percutaneous
      cryoneurolysis procedure of the ipsilateral T2-T5 intercostal nerves in a
      randomized, patient- and observer-masked fashion. Participants all received a
      continuous paravertebral block with ropivacaine 0.2% until the early morning of
      discharge (usually postoperative day 2). The primary end point was the average
      pain level measured using a 0-10 numeric rating scale the afternoon of
      postoperative day 2. Participants were followed for 1 year. RESULTS.: On
      postoperative day 2, participants who had received active cryoneurolysis (n=31)
      had a median [IQR] pain score of 0 [0, 1.4] versus 3.0 [2.0, 5.0] in patients
      given sham (n=29): difference (97.5%CI) -2.5 (-3.5, -1.5), P<0.001. There was
      evidence of superior analgesia through Month 12. During the first 3 weeks,
      cryoneurolysis lowered cumulative opioid use by 98%, with the active group using 
      0.3 [0, 2.8] mg of oxycodone compared with 15.0 [4.0, 24.0] mg in the sham group 
      (P<0.001). No oral analgesics were required by any patient between Months 1-12.
      After 1 year chronic pain had developed in 1 (3%) active compared with 5 (17%)
      sham participants (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS.: Percutaneous cryoneurolysis markedly
      improved analgesia without systemic side effects or complications following
      mastectomy.

TI  - Relationships of low-grade systemic inflammation and nutritional status with
      erectile dysfunction severity in men on dialysis.
LID - 10.1111/andr.13259 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-grade systemic inflammation and malnutrition are frequently
      observed in patients on dialysis and contribute to the development of endothelial
      dysfunction, however, the role of these conditions in erectile dysfunction (ED)
      severity remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationships
      of low-grade systemic inflammation and nutritional status with ED severity in men
      on dialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study included 71 men on
      dialysis. The Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) was used to assess ED. Men
      were classified as the mild/moderate (SHIM score >/= 8) and severe ED (SHIM score
      </= 7) groups. C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR) and Geriatric Nutritional
      Risk Index (GNRI) were used to evaluate low-grade systemic inflammation and
      nutritional status, respectively. We performed multivariate analysis to assess
      the relationships of CAR and GNRI with severe ED. RESULTS: The median age of the 
      included men was 64 years old. All men had any degree of ED with 65% having
      severe ED. In the univariate analyses, a significant association was observed
      between elevated CAR (>/= 0.09) and severe ED (odds ratio [OR]: 4.038, P =
      0.025), whereas no significant association was observed between lower GNRI (< 92)
      and severe ED (OR: 2.357, P = 0.109). In the multivariate analysis, an
      association between elevated CAR and severe ED was still significant (OR: 5.985, 
      P = 0.010). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Low-grade systemic inflammation was
      significantly associated with ED severity, whereas lower GNRI was not. These
      results may be helpful for further research to identify the optimal treatment for
      men suffering from severe ED. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Prognosis of systemic inflammation at an early stage of cirrhosis using the
      monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio during malnutrition risk screening: a prospective
      cohort study.
LID - 10.1080/00325481.2022.2110600 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), as a
      systemic inflammation index, predicts malnutrition risk during the early stages
      of cirrhosis. METHODS: We conducted a single-center prospective cohort study,
      enrolling patients from June 2016 to September 2020. The patients underwent
      malnutrition risk assessments upon admission. The patients were classified into
      five clinical stages according to portal hypertension. The malnutrition risk was 
      scored using the Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing Tool (RFH-NPT) and 
      validated by the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) or Liver Disease
      Undernutrition Screening Tool (LDUST). Routine clinical laboratory measurements
      were performed to calculate the MLR, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class, and model
      for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. The patients were followed up for 2
      years. RESULTS: Among the 154 patients with cirrhosis, 60 had compensated
      cirrhosis and 94 had decompensated cirrhosis. The optimal cutoff value of the
      MLR, >0.4, was effective in predicting malnutrition related to death or liver
      transplantation. Those with a high malnutrition risk defined by the NRS-2002 or
      RFH-NPT had a higher MLR than those with a low malnutrition risk. For patients
      with class A CTP cirrhosis or a MELD score of <10, an MLR cutoff of <0.4
      significantly distinguished more patients with a low malnutrition risk than those
      with a high malnutrition risk. Both the RFH-NPT score and MLR increased
      significantly across the decompensated cirrhosis substages. Interestingly, the
      MLR exhibited a positive correlation with the RFH-NPT score until varices
      appeared, but the correlation was the highest at the substage of a history of
      variceal bleeding (r = 0.714, P = 0.009). Multivariable analysis demonstrated
      that an MLR of >0.4 was an independent factor for malnutrition risk by screening 
      with the RFH-NPT, and this was confirmed using the LDUST and NRS-2002.
      CONCLUSION: Immune-related inflammatory dysfunction predicts malnutrition risk
      during the early stages of cirrhosis.

TI  - Cognitive Reserve and Cognitive Functioning among Oldest Old Adults: Findings
      from the Georgia Centenarian Study.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1080/0361073X.2022.2106717 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Living a long life does not guarantee the maintenance of optimal
      cognitive functioning; however, similar to older adults in general, cognitive
      reserve may also protect oldest-old adults from cognitive decline. The purpose of
      this study was to assess cognitive reserve among centenarians and octogenarians
      and to evaluate a process model of cognitive reserve. METHODS: A total of 321
      centenarians and octogenarians from the Georgia Centenarian Study were included
      in this study. Cognitive reserve components included level of education,
      occupational responsibility, current social engagement, past engaged lifestyle,
      and activity. Cognitive functioning was measured with the Mini-Mental Status
      Examination. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling was computed, and the overall 
      model fit well, chi2 (df = 3) = 5.02, p = .17; CFI = .99, RMSEA = .05. Education 
      is directly and indirectly related to cognitive functioning through occupational 
      responsibility and past engaged lifestyle. Current social engagement is related
      to cognitive functioning directly and indirectly through current activities. The 
      four direct predictors (i.e., education, current social engagement, current
      activity, and past engaged lifestyle) explained 35% of the variance in cognitive 
      functioning. CONCLUSION: The results provide important information for cognitive 
      reserve theories with implications for interventions that build cognitive
      reserve.

      confidence in complex operative deliveries.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/01443615.2022.2107899 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this before and after study was to evaluate the efficacy of a complex 
      operative obstetrics course in improving practitioner confidence. The course
      covered rotational instrumental vaginal delivery, vaginal breech delivery,
      cervical cerclage, management of postpartum haemorrhage, and complex caesarean
      section. Participants filled in a pre- and postcourse questionnaire using a
      Likert scale to rate confidence from 1 (not confident) to 5 (very confident) in
      15 key skills. Data were analysed using a two-sample t-test for comparison of
      means. Data were collected from 67 participants. Practitioner confidence
      increased across all skills studied. The largest increases in mean confidence
      scores were seen in classical caesarean section (score increase 2.45; p < 0.05)
      and management of head entrapment at breech (score increase 2.24; p < 0.05). The 
      course was successful in improving practitioner confidence across a range of
      obstetric skills.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject?
      Team-based training for obstetric emergencies has been shown to improve
      practitioner knowledge, team behaviours and patient outcomes. Simulation training
      in operative vaginal delivery improves operator technique and reduces adverse
      outcomes for mothers and babies.What do the results of this study add? Hands-on
      simulator training in complex operative obstetrics improves practitioner
      confidence in managing a range of obstetric emergencies including those less
      frequently encountered. These include rotational instrumental delivery, vaginal
      breech delivery, complex caesarean section, postpartum haemorrhage and cervical
      cerclage.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or
      future research? This study supports the increased use of simulation in advanced 
      obstetric training with an easily replicated cost efficient course. Further
      research is warranted to determine whether simulation training improves
      practitioner competence and patient outcomes.

LID - 10.1002/jso.27048 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
      disrupted healthcare access and medical treatment, including oncological care.
      Treatment delay in ovarian cancer could impact survival. We aimed to assess if
      there were delays and treatment changes in a cohort of epithelial ovarian cancer 
      patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of epithelial ovarian cancer patients
      included cases diagnosed during the first 22 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in
      the state of Sao Paulo and those diagnosed in the 22 months preceding the
      outbreak. Time-to-treat was measured in days. In each group, surgery and
      chemotherapy proportions were assessed according to healthcare insurance status. 
      RESULTS: A 56.2% reduction in epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis was identified 
      during the pandemic group compared to the prepandemic group; fewer patients were 
      diagnosed in stage I (p < 0.01). Time-to-treat increased from 18.9 to 23 days (p 
      < 0.01). Surgery in the public sector fell from 74.6% to 65.3% during the
      pandemic, compared to 87.1% to 68.8% in the private sector. CONCLUSION: There
      were fewer overall diagnoses, reduced stage I diagnosis, increased time-to-treat,
      and a reduction in the proportion of patients submitted to surgery. Brazil's
      public healthcare system demonstrated a higher resiliency to treatment change
      than the private sector.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of C677T polymorphism of
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene with autistic behavior and
      inheritance pattern of children patients. METHODS: Ninety three autism patients
      were selected as the study group, whilst 93 healthy children were selected as the
      control group. The C677T genotype of the MTHFR gene was determined, and the
      correlation between the genotype and the autistic behavior and inheritance
      pattern were investigated. RESULTS: MTHFR gene C677T locus revealed three
      genotypes CC, CT and TT. Compared with the control group, the study group had
      fewer CC genotype but more TT genotype (P<0.05). Individuals with the three
      genotypes showed a statistically significant difference in the frequencies of
      four problem behaviors (P<0.05). Regression analysis showed that at least one T
      allele encoding the degree of 1 and 2 for the 4 problem behaviors that were
      statistically different. MTHFR gene C677T genotype was associated with autism
      under the recessive inheritance model and allelic inheritance model (P<0.05).
      CONCLUSION: The C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene is associated with autistic 
      behaviors. Children with the TT genotype or T allele are at higher risk of
      developing autism, particularly direct gaze, complex limb movements,
      self-injurious behavior and hyperactivity 1 and 2 related with the degree of
      coding.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor 
      receptor 1 (VEGFR1) pathways-related genes and the risk of pre-eclampsia.
      METHODS: In total 178 pregnant women with pre-eclampsia (case group) and 100
      healthy pregnant women (control group) during the third trimester were enrolled. 
      The SNPs of VEGF rs3025039, rs2010963 and VEGFR1 rs3812867, rs55875014 and
      rs722503 loci were determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism
      (PCR-RFLP) assay. The levels of serum VEGF and sVEGFR1 were also determined. And 
      their association with pre-eclampsia was analyzed. RESULTS: The systolic blood
      pressure, diastolic blood pressure and sVEGFR1 of the case group were
      significantly higher than those of the control group, while the VEGF level was
      significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). Allelic frequencies 
      of the VEGF (rs3025039, rs2010963) and VEGFR1 (rs3812867, rs55875014, rs722503)
      have fit the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P>0.05). The frequency of T allele of
      VEGF at rs3025039 locus in the case group was higher than that in the control
      group (P<0.05). There were significant differences in VEGF at rs3025039 locus
      under dominant and co-dominant models in case group (P<0.05). Compared with those
      with CC, the risk was higher in patients with CT or TT genotypes (P<0.05). The
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure and sVEGFR1 in pre-eclampsia pregnant women
      with CT or TT genotypes were significantly higher than those with the CC
      genotype, while their VEGF level was significantly lower (P<0.05). No significant
      difference was found in allelic frequencies of other four loci between the two
      groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of rs3025039 locus of VEGF gene is
      associated with the occurrence of pre-eclampsia. The variant at this locus may
      affect the activity of VEGF and influence the development of pre-eclampsia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a girl with distinctive facial
      features, epilepsy, intellectual disability, chronic constipation and
      hypopigmentation of neck and upper extremities. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing
      was carried out for the proband. Candidate variant was verified by Sanger
      sequencing. RESULTS: The proband was found to harbor a heterozygous nonsense
      c.586G>T (p.Glu196*) variant of the ZEB2 gene, which was unreported previously.
      The variant was not detected in either parent. CONCLUSION: The ZEB2 gene c.586G>T
      (p.Glu196*) variant probably underlay the Mowat-Wilson syndrome in this patient. 
      Hypopigmentation in the neck and upper extremities may be related to Mowat-Wilson
      syndrome. Prenatal diagnosis was recommended for subsequent pregnancies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical phenotype and variant of SLC2A1 gene in a
      Chinese pedigree affected with glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome
      (GLUT1-DS). METHODS: Clinical data of a child who was treated due to delayed
      motor and language development and his family members were collected. DNA was
      extracted from peripheral blood samples and subjected to high-throughput medical 
      exome sequencing. Candidate variant was verified by Sanger sequencing of his
      parents and sister. The genotype-phenotype correlation was explored. RESULTS: The
      child, his mother and sister had common manifestations such as delayed mental and
      motor development, poor exercise tolerance, easy fatigue and paroxysmal dystonia,
      but the difference was that the child and his mother had microcephaly and
      seizures, while his sister did not. A heterozygous missense SLC2A1 c.191T>C
      (p.L64P) variant was identified in all affected members, which was unreported
      previously. CONCLUSION: The missense SLC2A1 c.191T>C (p.L64P) variant probably
      underlay the disease in the proband and his mother and sister. Variability of the
      clinical phenotypes has reflected the genetic and phenotypic diversity of
      GLUT1-DS. Detection of the novel variant has enriched the spectrum of GLUT1-DS
      mutations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical phenotype and MYH7 gene variant in a Chinese
      pedigree affected with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS: The proband
      was screened for variant of 96 cardiomyopathy-associated genes by exonic
      amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Candidate variant was verified by
      Sanger sequencing among 300 healthy controls as well as family members of the
      proband. Co-segregation analysis of genotypes and clinical phenotypes was carried
      out for the pedigree. Clustal X software was used to analyze the sequence
      conservation of the variant among various species, and its pathogenicity was
      predicted by using bioinformatics software. RESULTS: 6 out of 12 members from
      this pedigree were found to harbor heterozygous c.4124A>G (p.Tyr1375Cys) variant 
      of the MYH7 gene, among whom five were diagnosed with HCM. The remaining one had 
      failed to meet the diagnostic criteria for HCM, but had abnormal ECG. The same
      variant was not found in the 300 healthy controls. Amino acid sequence analysis
      showed that the variant is located in a highly conserved region, and
      bioinformatics analysis predicted that this variant may affect protein function
      and has a deleterious effect. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics
      and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, the variant was predicted to be likely pathogenic
      (PM2+ PP1_Moderate+PP3+PP5). CONCLUSION: The c.4124A>G (p.Tyr1375Cys) variant of 
      the MYH7 gene probably underlay the pathogenesis in this pedigree. Above finding 
      has important value for the early diagnosis of patients with HCM.

LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20210612-00499 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a Chinese patient suspected for
      Canavan disease. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out for the
      proband, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing of the
      proband, her parents and brother. Prenatal diagnosis was provided to her mother
      by chorionic villi sampling (CVS) upon her subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: The
      proband, a 4-month-old female infant, had manifested drowsiness, hypotonia and
      apathy. Urine metabolism screening showed elevated N-acetylaspartic acid. Cranial
      magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal myelination and multiple abnormal
      signals in large brain areas. WES revealed that the proband has harbored compound
      heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene, namely c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) in exon 1
      and c.634+1G>A (P.?) in exon 4. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the c.187A>G
      (p.Arg63Gly) and c.634+1G>A (p.?) variants were respectively inherited from her
      mother and father. Her phenotypically normal brother has carried a heterozygous
      c.634+1G>A (p.?) variant. Prenatal diagnosis by CVS indicated that the fetus was 
      a heterozygous carrier of the c.187A>G variant. CONCLUSION: WES can facilitate
      the diagnosis of Canavan disease, particularly for those lacking specific
      phenotypes of the disease. The compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene
      probably underlay the Canavan disease in this patient, and the result has enabled
      prenatal diagnosis for this family.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a Chinese pedigree affected with
      microphthalmia. METHODS: Clinical data of the proband was collected. Whole exome 
      sequencing (WES) was carried out to screen potential pathogenic variants in the
      proband. Candidate variant was verified by Sanger sequencing of the proband and
      his family members. Pathogenicity of the variant was predicted by searching the
      PubMed database and bioinformatic analysis. Sanger sequencing of amniotic fluid
      sample was carried out for prenatal diagnosis. RESULTS: The proband and his
      father were found to harbor a heterozygous c.151C>G (p.R51G) variant of the
      MAB21L2 gene. The same variant was not found in his mother and grandparents.
      Based on the guidelines of American College of Medical Genetics, the c.151C>G
      (p.R51G) variant was predicted as likely pathogenic. CONCLUSION: The c.151C>G
      (p.R51G) variant of the MAB21L2 gene probably underlay the microphthalmia in the 
      proband. Above finding has facilitated prenatal diagnosis for this pedigree.

      variants were unreported previously. CONCLUSION: The nonsense variants of the
      ARID1B gene probably underlay the etiology in these patients. Above finding has
      enriched the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of the disease and provided a
      basis for prenatal diagnosis.

      patients had presented with mental and language retardation, along with growth
      delay and facial anomalies. They were both found to harbor de novo
      loss-of-function variants in exon 12 of the ASXL3 gene, namely c.3096dup
      (p.Pro1033Thrfs*2) and c.3253G>T (p.Gly1085*). Neither variant was reported
      previously. Combined with their clinical features and genetic finding, both
      patients were diagnosed with Bainbridge-Ropes syndrome due to pathogenic variants
      of the ASXL3 gene. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of Bainbridge Ropes syndrome in the two 
      pedigrees has enriched the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of this disorder and
      enabled genetic counseling for them.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for fetuses with renal anomalies.
      METHODS: Genomic DNA of four fetuses and their parents was extracted from
      amniotic fluid and peripheral blood samples and subjected to whole genome
      sequencing. Candidate variants were predicted according to the American College
      of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines and validated by SNP-array and
      Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Two fetuses were found to carry a 1.45 Mb pathogenic 
      microdeletion in 17q12 and a pathogenic 1.85 Mb microduplication at 1q21.1-21.2, 
      respectively. One fetus was found to harbor compound heterozygous variants
      c.8301del (p.Asn2768Thrfs*18) and c.4481del (p.Asn1494Thrfs*6) of the PKHD1 gene,
      which were predicted to be pathogenic. And one fetus has harbored homozygous
      c.1372dup (p.Thr458Asnfs*5) variants of the BBS12 gene, which was predicted to be
      likely pathogenic. All variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSION: 
      Whole genome sequencing can enable efficient prenatal diagnosis for fetuses with 
      renal anomalies with high accuracy.

TI  - The effects of REG4 expression on chemoresistance of ovarian cancer.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/01443615.2022.2106834 [doi]
AB  - Although ovarian cancer usually responds well to platinum- and taxane-based
      first-line chemotherapy, most patients develop recurrence and chemoresistance.
      Regenerating gene 4 (REG4) is a secretory protein involved in cell
      differentiation and proliferation. We found higher REG4 expression in ovarian
      cancer than in normal tissues (p < .05). Regenerating gene 4 expression was
      negatively associated with overall, progression-free or post-progression survival
      rates of patients with ovarian cancer receiving platinum or paclitaxel treatment 
      (p < .05) according to a Kaplan-Meier plotter. Regenerating gene 4 overexpression
      resulted in either cisplatin or paclitaxel resistance, and apoptosis resistance
      in CAOV3 ovarian cancer cells (p < .05). REG4-transfected ovarian cancer cells
      showed stronger migration and invasion treated with cisplatin or paclitaxel (p < 
      .05). Additionally, cisplatin or paclitaxel exposure led to the overexpression of
      phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p-PI3K), p-Akt, phosphorylated
      mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), glutathione S-transferase-pi, survivin,
      and B-cell lymphoma 2 in REG4 transfectants compared with control cells (p <
      .05). These findings suggested that REG4 expression was up-regulated in ovarian
      cancer, and associated with poor survival and chemotherapy resistance. REG4
      promoted the occurrence, development, and chemotherapy resistance of ovarian
      cancer by regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion, and 
      PI3K/Akt/m-TOR signalling pathways. IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this
      subject? REG4 mRNA expression is up-regulated in many digestive cancers. High
      REG4 expression was associated with an adverse prognosis, high tumour and nodal
      stages, poor differentiation, and hepatic and peritoneal metastases of digestive 
      cancers. REG4 expression conferred cancer cells with increased resistance to
      chemoradiotherapy, especially 5-FU-based treatment, by activating the
      MAPK/Erk/Bim signalling pathway.What do the results of this study add? REG4 was
      highly expressed in ovarian cancer. The expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR,
      GST-pi, survivin, and Bcl-2 was increased in REG4-overexpressing cells. High REG4
      expression was significantly associated with inferior OS, PFS, and PPS rates in
      patients with ovarian cancer receiving platinum chemotherapy. REG4 mediated
      cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in CAOV3 ovarian cancer cells. The percentage
      of apoptotic cells was markedly lower in REG4-transfected compared to
      mock-transfected cells after cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment.What are the
      implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?
      This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of REG4 expression in
      ovarian cancer treated with platinum and paclitaxel, to explore REG4
      chemoresistance mechanisms to platinum and paclitaxel, and to provide a
      scientific experimental basis for the clinical treatment and outcome evaluation
      of ovarian cancer. In order to provide comprehensive clinical treatment of
      ovarian cancer, it is helpful to improve our understanding of multi-drug
      resistance and identify new cancer diagnostic biomarkers.

      welfare?
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/10888705.2022.2105648 [doi]
AB  - When the gradation of animal welfare is scored through ordinal scales and
      equidistant tags are used, empirical data between tags tend to be
      non-equidistant. Ordinal rate scales (ORS) and visual analogue scales (VAS) were 
      tested for the assessment of contact dermatitis on breast and abdominal areas
      (CD), footpad dermatitis (FP), hock burns (HB) and bird soiling (BS) in broiler
      chickens. Calculations regarding the inter-rater reliability, the correlation
      between VAS and ORS and amongst the welfare indicators measured with both scales,
      and the equidistance of ORS categories in relation to values measured using VAS, 
      were made. A total of 1,303 broiler chickens from 10 flocks was assessed on-farm 
      by three raters using both scales. Inter-rater reliabilities of CD and HB were
      higher when using VAS compared with ORS, but FP was lower. Correlations between
      scales varied between 0.90-0.97 and 0.77-0.95 (P<0.001), considering mean and
      individual values. Low-to-moderate correlations were observed between the four
      indicators using the scales. Tags on VAS that best represented ORS were
      non-equidistant. Results suggest both scales were reliable assessing the selected
      broiler chicken welfare indicators.

PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/23335432.2022.2108899 [doi]
AB  - Tendons play a crucial role in the musculoskeletal system. In humans, tendon
      injuries, especially chronic tendinopathy, are very common and the patellar
      tendon is a frequent location for tendinopathy or injuries. The biomechanical
      characteristics of the patellar tendon, such as elasticity and stiffness, are of 
      paramount importance and constitute major outcome measures in research studies.
      We aimed to assess whether the stiffness of the healthy ovine patellar tendon
      changes with age and weight in a population of normal animals. Sixty-eight
      'patella-patellar tendon-tibial tuberosity' units from thirty-four Ile-de-France 
      ewes of body mass 65 to 95 kg, euthanized for reasons other than musculoskeletal 
      diseases, underwent a tensile test providing a measure of the tendon stiffness.
      Animals were sorted into three categories of age (1-2 yo, 3-5 yo, 6-10 yo). We
      found a positive but not significant correlation between age category and
      stiffness (r = 0.22, p = 0.27). There was a significantly positive correlation
      between weight and stiffness (r = 0.39, p = 0.04). In conclusion, the study
      characterized biomechanical properties of healthy tendons, provided useful
      reference values, and established the basis for future biomechanical tests on
      healing tendons in sheep. The most appropriate sheep population for those future 
      studies would be non-overweight young adults presenting with no lameness.

TI  - Noninvasive Evaluation of the Notch Signaling Pathway via Radiomic Signatures
      Based on Multiparametric MRI in Association With Biological Functions of Patients
      With Glioma: A Multi-institutional Study.
LID - 10.1002/jmri.28378 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Noninvasive determination of Notch signaling is important for
      prognostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention in glioma. PURPOSE: To predict
      Notch signaling using multiparametric (mp) MRI radiomics and correlate with
      biological characteristics in gliomas. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: A
      total of 63 patients for model construction and 47 patients from two public
      databases for external testing. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 1.5 T and 3.0 T,
      T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2WI, T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR),
      contrast-enhanced (CE)-T1WI. ASSESSMENT: Radiomic features were extracted from
      CE-T1WI, T1WI, T2WI, and T2FLAIR and imaging signatures were selected using a
      least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Diagnostic performance was
      compared between single modality and a combined mpMRI radiomics model. A
      radiomic-clinical nomogram was constructed incorporating the mpMRI radiomic
      signature and Karnofsky Performance score. The performance was validated in the
      test set. The radiomic signatures were correlated with immunohistochemistry (IHC)
      analysis of downstream Notch pathway components. STATISTICAL TESTS: Receiver
      operating characteristic curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), Pearson
      correlation, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. A P value < 0.05 was considered
      statistically significant. RESULTS: The radiomic signature derived from the
      combination of all sequences numerically showed highest area under the curve
      (AUC) in both training and external test sets (AUCs of 0.857 and 0.823). The
      radiomics nomogram that incorporated the mpMRI radiomic signature and KPS status 
      resulted in AUCs of 0.891 and 0.859 in the training and test sets. The
      calibration curves showed good agreement between prediction and observation in
      both sets (P= 0.279 and 0.170, respectively). DCA confirmed the clinical
      usefulness of the nomogram. IHC identified Notch pathway inactivation and the
      expression levels of Hes1 correlated with higher combined radiomic scores (r =
      -0.711) in Notch1 mutant tumors. DATA CONCLUSION: The mpMRI-based radiomics
      nomogram may reflect the intratumor heterogeneity associated with downstream
      biofunction that predicts Notch signaling in a noninvasive manner. EVIDENCE
      LEVEL: 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

TI  - Mediators of energy homeostasis in hyperthyroidism.
LID - 10.20945/2359-3997000000511 [doi]
LID - 2359-3997000000511 [pii]
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of hyperthyroidism and 
      its treatment on body weight and composition, insulin resistance, and mediators
      of appetite and energy homeostasis, namely ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin, and
      fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Subjects and methods: Thirty-five adult
      patients (27 female and 8 male, aged 39.63 +/- 9.70 years) with overt
      hyperthyroidism were evaluated for leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, and FGF21
      levels; insulin resistance; and body composition using DEXA both at baseline and 
      a minimum of two months following normalization of serum thyroxin on carbimazole 
      treatment. Comparison of means between the baseline and post treatment values was
      performed by the paired t test for normally distributed parameters and by the
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-normally distributed data. Results:
      Hyperthyroidism correction resulted in an increase in weight from 51.15 +/- 8.50 
      kg to 55.74 +/- 8.74 kg (P < 0.001), paradoxically accompanied by a decrease in
      insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR from 1.35 (1.02-1.72) to 0.73
      (0.52-0.93) (P < 0.001). Correction of hyperthyroidism was also associated with a
      decrease in FGF21 from 58 (55-64) to 52 (47-58) pg/mL (P < 0.001) and in leptin
      levels from 17 (7-36) to 11 (4.6-28) ng/mL (P = 0.03). Conclusion: Despite lower 
      body weight, thyrotoxicosis is associated with insulin resistance. High levels of
      thermogenic hormones, leptin, and FGF21 were observed in thyrotoxicosis and may
      be partly responsible for the excessive heat production typical of this
      condition.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of total
      cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) alterations in children and
      adolescents in Brazil. Subjects and methods: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis of prevalence. The search for articles was carried out in the
      databases: Medline (PubMed), Embase, Scientific Electronic Library Online
      (SciELO), Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (Lilacs).
      The meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model. The I(2) test was
      used to identify heterogeneity. Results: The present metanalysis revealed a
      significant prevalence of altered lipid profile in children and adolescents in
      Brazil. Regarding lipoprotein fractions, the prevalence of altered TC level was
      27.47% (95% CI 24.36-30.82), and a smaller prevalence was observed for LDL
      cholesterol (19.29% - 95% CI 15.21-24.16). The models revealed high heterogeneity
      (I(2) = 99%; p < 0.01), however the precise source of it was not identified;
      although type of school, age group, year and the region of Brazil appeared to
      influence the estimations of altered lipid profiles. Conclusion: An important
      prevalence of lipid alterations was observed among Brazilian children and
      adolescents. Those results reinforce the importance of knowing the lipid profile 
      of children and adolescents to perform early interventions for this public.

LID - 2359-3997000000505 [pii]
AB  - Objective: Test if the MRI FAST1.2 protocol can detect extra-pituitary midline
      structural brain abnormalities in patients with ectopic posterior pituitary
      (EPP), and highlighting their radiological-laboratory correlations. Subjects and 
      methods: Cross-sectional study of patients with EPP and control group. All
      individuals were submitted to FAST1.2, which combines the FAST1 protocol
      developed by our group with 3D T2DRIVE imaging. Results: We evaluated 36
      individuals with EPP and 78 as control group. Pituitary stalk (PS) was identified
      in 7/36 patients in EPP group by FAST1, and in 24/36 patients in FAST1.2 (p <
      0.001). FAST1 failed to detect PS in one individual in the control group, while
      the FAST1.2 defined the PS in all individuals. In EPP group, eleven had
      interhypothalamic adhesion (IHA), three septo-optic dysplasia, and one cerebellar
      malformation. We didn't observe higher frequency of panhypopituitarism or
      developmental delay in patients with IHA. In control group, three had pars
      intermedia cysts, one hydrocephalus, and one hypothalamic hamartoma. Conclusion: 
      FAST1.2 allows confident recognition of midline structural abnormalities,
      including the pituitary stalk and IHA, thereby making MRI acquisition faster and 
      with no need for contrast administration. IHA could be associated with defects in
      neuronal migration, as occur in patients with EPP, with no clinical significance.

AB  - Objective: Herein, we compared ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) between young
      adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase enzyme
      (21OHase) deficiency and a control group. Additionally, we analyzed correlations 
      between the glucocorticoid dose and androgen levels and ABP parameters. Subjects 
      and methods: This case-control study included 18 patients (6 males and 12
      females) and 19 controls (8 males and 11 females) matched by age (18-31 years).
      ABP monitoring was used to estimate blood pressure (BP) over a 24-h period.
      Results: No difference was noted between patients and controls in terms of
      systolic BP (males, 115.5 +/- 5.6 vs. 117.0 +/- 9.3, P = 0.733; and females,
      106.4 +/- 7.9 vs. 108.4 +/- 7.6, P = 0.556, respectively) and diastolic BP during
      24 h (males, 62.8 +/- 7.5 vs. 66.2 +/- 5.6, P = 0.349; and females, 62.7 +/- 4.9 
      vs. 62.3 +/- 4.9, P = 0.818, respectively). Systolic and diastolic BP and pulse
      pressure during daytime and nocturnal periods were similar between patients and
      controls. Furthermore, no differences were detected in the percentage of load and
      impaired nocturnal dipping of systolic and diastolic BP between patients and
      controls during the 24-h period. Additionally, the glucocorticoid dose (varying
      between r = -0.24 to 0.13, P > 0.05) and androgens levels (varying between r =
      0.01 to 0.14, P > 0.05) were not associated with ABP parameters. Conclusion: No
      signs of an elevated risk for hypertension were observed based on ABP monitoring 
      in young adults with CAH attributed to 21OHase deficiency undergoing
      glucocorticoid replacement therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the variations in tear parameters and meibomian gland
      morphology after epithelial-on (epi-on) corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) in
      keratoconus (KC) patients. METHODS: This prospective observational study included
      38 KC eyes that underwent epithelium-on CXL. Thirty-three eyes of 33 stable KC
      patients with no prior CXL treatment formed the KC group and 35 eyes of 35
      healthy volunteers were recruited as the control group. All participants were
      evaluated by Schirmer I test, first and average noninvasive tear break-up time
      (NITBUT), ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire, and meibography
      scores. The CXL patients were evaluated preoperatively and at the 1st, 3rd, and
      6th months, and participants without any intervention (KC and control groups)
      were evaluated initially, at 1st, 3rd, and 6th months. RESULTS: The KC patients
      had significantly lower average NITBUT, higher OSDI scores, and impaired
      meibomian gland morphology than healthy individuals (NITBUT(seconds): KC,
      12.8(2.4-17.6), healthy group (HG), 17.1(6.8-17.6); p = 0.012, OSDI: KC,
      27.5(0.0-87.5), HG, 7.5(0.0-55.0); p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). A
      significant difference was found in Schirmer values of the CXL group at 0-1st
      months, first NITBUT values at 1-6 months, and average NITBUT values at 1-3 and
      1-6 months (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, p = 0.003, p = 0.001, respectively). All
      meibography parameters remained unchanged after CXL over a 6-month follow-up
      compared to initial measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the KC patients had
      lower NITBUT, higher OSDI scores, and increased meibomian gland disfunction, the 
      CXL treatment did not significantly affect tear quantity, dry eye symptoms, and
      meibomian gland morphology.

TI  - COVID-19 outbreak and the impact on renal disorders: A rapid review.
PG  - 253-261
LID - 10.5152/tud.2020.20179 [doi]
AB  - In this rapid review, we aimed to evaluate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) on renal functions and mortality of patients with kidney diseases. We 
      searched MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, UpToDate,
      and TRIP databases using the following keywords: COVID-19, COVID19, 2019-nCoV,
      2019-CoV, coronavirus, SARS-nCoV-2, urology, cancer, bladder, prostate, kidney,
      trauma, stone, neurogenic, and reconstructive. The initial search resulted in 495
      records. After the primary screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts and
      removing duplicates, 10 articles were selected and included in this rapid review.
      Moreover, we performed meta-analysis of binary data for the outcomes with
      sufficient data. Owing to a high level of heterogeneity because of different
      study designs and contexts, we used a random model for the meta-analysis. Only 5 
      studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. In these studies, comprising 964
      COVID-19 positive patients, the cumulative event rate of acute kidney injury
      (AKI) was 7.1% (95% confidence interval: 1.8%-24.5%, p<0.001, I2=92.4). Based on 
      the qualitative synthesis of the 10 included studies, patients with COVID-19 and 
      kidney diseases had higher risk of in-hospital mortality. If AKI occurs because
      of the novel coronavirus, the mortality rate will be very high. Therefore, we
      need further investigations and more studies to recognize the extent and the
      cause of renal involvement in COVID-19.

      incontinence: Efficacy and safety of midurethral slings: 24-month follow-up
      results.
PG  - 216-222
LID - 10.5152/tud.2021.21059 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy rate of polyvinylidene fluoride
      (PVDF) slings in the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI).
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective pilot study was conducted with women with SUI
      who underwent PVDF slings. Data regarding subjective (International Consultation 
      on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence [ICIQ-UI] and International 
      Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Overactive Bladder [ICIQ-OAB]) and
      objective (stress test and bladder diary) outcomes and complication rates were
      evaluated. Primary outcomes were objective (negative pad and stress test) and
      subjective (no leakage episodes) success after a median follow-up of 24 months.
      RESULTS: PVDF slings demonstrated a high level of satisfaction with objective
      cure (transobturator 90% compared with retropubic 100%, P = .90), urgency to
      urinate, frequency of de novo incontinence (transobturator 90% compared with
      retropubic 80%, P = .85), ability of physical and sexual activity (transobturator
      90% compared with retropubic 100%, P = .90). The multivariate logistic regression
      model for satisfaction was associated with overall treatment success (odds ratio 
      [OR] = 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.32-6.1), greater reduction in ICIQ-UI
      (OR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.78-1.85) and ICIQ-OAB (OR =0.99; 95% CI 0.89-1.78). The
      total Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score for both groups was 19.3 +/- 1.2 
      and 20.7 +/- 1.8, statistically significant when compared with perioperative FSFI
      score 16.7 +/- 1.1 and 17.6 +/- 1.4 (P < .001). CONCLUSION: PVDF mid-urethral
      slings are safe with clinically efficacies at 3, 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up
      for the treatment of SUI. The high level of satisfaction seen after PVDF sling
      procedures is associated with objective improvement of SUI and fewer slings
      related complications. Further studies using larger sample sizes with longer and 
      comparative clinical follow-up are required.

      quality of life, questionnaire-based study.
PG  - 205-209
LID - 10.5152/tud.2021.20489 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to assess the quality of life (QoL) with
      or without surgical intervention in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) with
      neurogenic bladder. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on
      SCI patients with neurogenic bladder. The questionnaires used to assess the QoL
      were the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36), the Incontinence
      questionnaire [Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6)], the International Index of
      Erectile Function (IIEF-5), and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Patients
      were categorized into two groups: the first group consisted of patients who
      underwent a surgical procedure and the second group included patients managed by 
      a conservative treatment option: clean intermittent bladder catheterization.
      RESULTS: Total of 29 patients included in the study, 13 patients underwent
      urinary diversion (mean age: 45.84+/-16.41 years) and 16 patients had a
      conservative treatment (mean age: 47.61+/-13.90 years). The SF-36 questionnaire
      evaluation revealed that the bodily pain component was significantly lower in
      patients who underwent urinary diversion (p=0.009), whereas vitality (p=0.045)
      and social functioning (p=0.005) components were significantly lower in patients 
      who underwent any type of urinary surgical procedure. The incontinence
      questionnaire (UDI-6) revealed significantly lower scores in patients who
      underwent urinary diversion (17.84+/-5.2) than patients who underwent a
      conservative treatment (47.05+/-5.8; p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Urinary surgical
      intervention improved the QoL in SCI patients with neurogenic bladder as per the 
      UDI-6 scores. However, contrasting results of the SF-36 assessment warrant its
      further validation by conducting studies with a larger sample size.

      radical prostatectomy.
PG  - 199-204
LID - 10.5152/tud.2021.20568 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current innovations in minimally invasive surgery include using
      ultra-low insufflation pressure with the aim of improving peri-operative and
      short-term clinical outcomes. Despite an exponential increase in the use of
      robotic technology, there remains limited literature supporting the use of
      ultra-low pressure during robotic surgery. We performed a feasibility study of
      ultra-low-pressure robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP).
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective data related to standard pressure (15 mm Hg)
      RARP (Group 1) and ultra-low-pressure (6 mm Hg) RARP (Group 2) were collected and
      compared to assess the peri-operative and short-term outcomes. RESULTS: Outcome
      data of 112 consecutive patients (56 in each group) were collected. Mean age,
      pre-operative prostate specific antigen, body mass index, and performance status 
      were similar in both groups. Mean console time was shorter in ultra-low-pressure 
      RARP group (125 minutes) than in standard pressure RARP group (138 minutes)
      (p=0.016). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in console time or
      estimated blood loss between these 2 groups for patients with RARP and lymph node
      dissection. No patients from either group required conversion to an open
      procedure or received a peri-operative blood transfusion. None of the patients in
      either group developed post-operative complications or needed readmission.
      CONCLUSION: Our study has demonstrated that ultra-low-pressure RARP is a
      practical and safe option, and it supports the routine practice of
      ultra-low-pressure RARP with slow adaptation in other complex robotic surgeries, 
      such as robotic cystectomy for bladder cancer.

PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1080/21681805.2022.2104366 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anticipating the total laser energy (TLE) of Holmium YAG laser
      required for ureteroscopic (URS) lithotripsy is essential to guide urologists in 
      selecting the optimal fiber size. This study aimed at evaluating the relationship
      between stone size and stone attenuation measured by HU as predictors for the TLE
      during the procedure. METHODS: We conducted an observational prospective cohort
      study of patients undergoing URS lithotripsy at the Urology department of Ain
      Shams University Hospitals from September 2018 to September 2019 with the use of 
      a holmium YAG laser as the lithotripsy method. Patients' demographic and clinical
      characteristics, stone location, stone size, stone attenuation measured by HU
      from the non-contrast CT, TLE, and procedure time were recorded. Data were
      analyzed using Jamovi software (version 2.0 for macOS). RESULTS: Forty patients
      were included in the study (22 males and 18 females) with a mean age of 57.8
      years. The mean stone size was 9.8 mm(3), the mean HU was 858.8 units, and the
      mean TLE was 3.5 KJ. Both stone size and stone attenuation measured by HU were
      positively correlated with TLE (r = 0.81 and 0.84, respectively; p < 0.001 for
      both). Further, regression analysis showed that both variables could
      significantly predict the TLE (ss = 0.001 and 0.71, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
      Both stone attenuation, as measured by HU, and stone size positively correlate
      with TLE required for URS lithotripsy. Therefore, both HU and stone size can
      predict the TLE, which will be helpful to guide the urologist in selecting the
      optimal fiber size for the procedure.

TI  - Telling the Whole Story: Bibliometric Network Analysis to Evaluate Impact of
      Media Attention on Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Research.
LID - 10.1089/neu.2022.0266 [doi]
AB  - There is a national debate regarding the existence of a relationship between
      contact sport participation and future risk of neurodegenerative disease. We
      employed bibliometrics and altmetrics to quantify the academic, popular, and
      social media impact of published scientific articles which report an association 
      between contact sports or military service with chronic traumatic encephalopathy 
      (CTE+) and compare to those scientific articles which report null or no
      association of contact sports or military service with CTE (CTE-). In this
      cross-sectional study, we extracted number of citations, total link strength,
      altmetric score, number of news stories, media outlets, and Twitter interaction, 
      from published CTE articles. The top 10 most-cited articles were statistically
      compared on these outcomes using Mann-Whitney U tests. CTE+ publications had an
      average of 101 citations per article, Altmetric score of 272, 36 news stories in 
      26 media outlets, and upper-bound of Twitter users of 402,159. CTE- publications 
      had an average of 29 citations per article, Altmetric score of 39, 2 news stories
      and media outlets, and upper-bound of Twitter users of 91,070. Top-10 CTE+
      publications had, on average: 94% more citations (p<0.001), 95% higher Altmetric 
      scores (p=0.01), 99% higher number of news stories (p=0.01), 98% higher number of
      media outlets (p=0.01) and reached 95% more Twitter users than top-10 CTE-
      publications (p=0.11). The bibliometric analysis indicates a significant
      inequality in media dissemination and popular consumption of scientific findings 
      that do not support a relationship between contact sports or military service and
      future neurodegeneration.

TI  - Rectal application of lidocaine reduces the severity of autonomic dysreflexia
      following experimental spinal cord injury.
LID - 10.1089/neu.2022.0274 [doi]
AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in devastating cardiovascular dysfunction.
      Noxious stimuli from the rectum during bowel routine often trigger
      life-threatening blood pressure surges, termed autonomic dysreflexia (AD). Rectal
      application of anesthetic lidocaine jelly has been recommended during bowel care 
      to reduce AD severity by mitigating sensory input. However, clinical studies have
      reported contradicting evidence. We performed a preclinical study on the efficacy
      of rectal lidocaine in a standardized rodent T3 transection model. 2% and 10%
      lidocaine significantly reduced AD severity by 32% and 50% respectively compared 
      to control (p<0.0001). Our pre-clinical experiments support the current
      recommendation of rectal lidocaine application during bowel care.

TI  - The Ideal Timing of Bedside Surgical Ligation of Patent Ductus Arteriosus in
      Premature Babies Less Than 30 Gestational Weeks.
PG  - 300-307
LID - 10.5152/TurkArchPediatr.2021.21010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to determine the relationship between exposure
      to hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus and morbidities in
      premature babies, the optimal number of pharmacologic treatment cycles, and ideal
      ductus ligation timing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a retrospective
      single-center study conducted in a 3-year period between July 2017 and June 2020.
      Premature babies, born </=30 weeks of gestation and transferred to our unit for
      bedside ductus ligation, were included in the study. The subjects were divided
      into 2 groups; Group A consisted of the patients who received >/=3 pharmacologic 
      treatment cycles, and group B consisted of the patients who received </=2 cycles.
      The groups were compared according to preoperative and postoperative features.
      The main outcome of the study was the presence of severe bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia. The secondary outcomes were specified as the length of stay in the
      neonatal intensive care unit and the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation 
      (MV). RESULTS: The study group consisted of 24 patients. There were 10 patients
      in group A and 14 patients in group B. The mean gestational week and the mean
      birthweight were found to be 26,7 +/- 2.2 weeks and 928 +/- 190 g, respectively. 
      The incidence of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia was significantly higher in
      group A (70% vs. 14.3%; P = .019). Post-ligation invasive MV, duration, and
      length of stay in the intensive care unit were found to be significantly longer
      in group A. None of the patients had hemodynamic disturbances or complications
      during and after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Bedside surgical ductus ligation is 
      a safe procedure. Prolonging pharmacologic treatment in order to avoid surgery
      increases the risk of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and prolongs hospital
      stay.

TI  - Improved microcanonical instanton theory.
LID - 10.1039/d2fd00063f [doi]
AB  - Canonical (thermal) instanton theory is now routinely applicable to complex
      gas-phase reactions and allows for the accurate description of tunnelling in
      highly non-separable systems. Microcanonical instanton theory is by contrast far 
      less well established. Here, we demonstrate that the best established
      microcanonical theory [S. Chapman, B. C. Garrett and W. H. Miller, J. Chem.
      Phys., 1975, 63, 2710-2716], fails to accurately describe the deep-tunnelling
      regime for systems where the frequencies of the orthogonal modes change rapidly
      along the instanton path. By taking a first principles approach to the derivation
      of microcanonical instanton theory, we obtain an improved method, which
      accurately recovers the thermal instanton rate when integrated over energy. The
      resulting theory also correctly recovers the separable limit and can be thought
      of as an instanton generalisation of Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory.
      When combined with the density-of-states approach [W. Fang, P. Winter and J. O.
      Richardson, J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2021, 17, 40-55], this new method can be
      straightforwardly applied to real molecular systems.

TI  - Evaluation of the Role of Intraoperative Frozen Section and Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging in Endometrial Cancer.
LID - 10.1002/ijgo.14389 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Histological type, grade, and myometrial invasion are major prognostic
      features of endometrial carcinoma since it can alter the decision-making on
      surgical procedure. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of preoperative
      endometrial biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of endometrial cancer
      compared to that of intraoperative frozen section. METHODS: This retrospective
      study included 264 patients who underwent surgery with intraoperative frozen
      section for endometrial cancer at our institution between 2014 and 2018.
      Diagnosis was determined by histological type, grade, and myometrial invasion.
      Concordance rate, sensitivity, and specificity of preoperative diagnosis and
      intraoperative frozen diagnosis were calculated, in comparison to the final
      pathological diagnosis. RESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative diagnoses showed
      no statistically significant difference in determining histological type and
      grade (p=0.152). Intraoperative diagnosis showed higher sensitivity for
      endometrioid carcinoma grade-3 and other types, and higher specificity for
      grade-1. For myometrial invasion, intraoperative diagnosis showed significantly
      higher concordance rate than preoperative MRI findings (p<0.01). Intraoperative
      diagnosis showed higher sensitivity and specificity in patients with and without 
      myometrial invasion, respectively. CONCLUSION: Higher agreement between
      intraoperative and final diagnoses, especially in myometrial invasion, suggests
      that intraoperative frozen section is a good indicator for appropriate surgical
      procedure decision-making.

      Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) A novelistic approach.
LID - 10.1002/ijgo.14390 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of heavy metals especially Te, TI, Os in recurrent
      pregnancy loss (RPL) and study their association with antioxidant status and DNA 
      damage. METHODS: This case controlled study included women with recurrent
      pregnancy loss (30) and healthy pregnant women as control (30). Following blood
      collection, serum levels of Thallium, Tellurium, Osmium, Lead, Mercury, and
      Cadmium were estimated by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass spectrophotometer.
      RESULTS: RPL patients exhibited significantly higher levels of heavy metals
      (P<0.001) when compared to control .Intriguingly, increased levels of serum TI,
      Te, Os and Pb were found negatively correlated with Total antioxidant status
      (P<0.05). Further, RPL group demonstrated strong positive correlation between
      heavy metals (TI, Te, Os and Pb) and DNA damage(P<0.05).No significant
      correlation between other heavy metals and markers of cellular damage was noted. 
      CONCLUSION: Enhanced levels of heavy metals in RPL patients and correlation of
      TI, Te, Os and Pb with markers of cellular damage is reflective of role of heavy 
      metal intoxication specially TI, Te and Os as potential risk factors in etiology 
      underlying recurrent miscarriage.

TI  - Post-operative morphologic changes of the isthmocele and clinical impact in
      patients treated by channel-like (360 degrees ) hysteroscopic technique.
LID - 10.1002/ijgo.14387 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the changes in 1) residual myometrial thickness (RMT), 2) 
      cesarean scar defect (CSD) size, and 3) clinical symptoms, before and after
      channel-like (360 degrees ) hysteroscopic resection for the treatment of CSD.
      METHODS: A single-center, observational, prospective, cohort study was carried
      out enrolling all symptomatic patients of childbearing age, diagnosed with CSD
      and routinely scheduled for channel-like (360 degrees ) hysteroscopic resection
      from July 2020 to July 2021 at the Division of Gynaecology and Human Reproduction
      Physiopathology, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences (DIMEC), IRCCS
      Azienda Ospedaliero-Univeristaria di Bologna. University of Bologna, Italy. The
      primary outcome was the difference in mean RMT before and after the procedure.
      Secondary outcomes were the differences before and 4 months after the surgery in:
      1) CSD size measured by transvaginal ultrasound, 2) Visual analogue scale (VAS)
      scores for the symptoms, and 3) Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) rate. Lastly,
      patients' satisfaction was assessed by the global impression of improvement
      (PGI-I) score. RESULTS: We found a significant difference before and after the
      procedure in: 1) mean RMT (+2.0 mm; p<0.001); mean size of the CSD (base: +1.6
      mm; height: -2.5 mm; transverse diameter: -3.2 mm; volume: -263.7 mm3; p<0.001); 
      2) mean VAS score for dyspareunia (-5.84; p<0.0001), dysmenorrhea (-8.94;
      p<0.0001), pelvic pain (-2.94; p=0.0002); 3) AUB rate (91% vs 3%; p<0.0001).
      Lastly, the mean PGI-I score +/- SD was 1.7+/-0.9. CONCLUSION: Channel-like (360 
      degrees ) hysteroscopic resection for the treatment of patients with symptomatic 
      CSD may lead to an increase in RMT, decrease in CSD and improvement of symptoms
      after the procedure, with high patients' satisfaction.

TI  - Unravelling the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and
      trabecular bone score in U.S. adults.
LID - 16311 [pii]
LID - 10.20452/pamw.16311 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The trabecular bone score (TBS) is a novel way for clinicians to
      evaluate bone quality. It is directly associated with bone mechanical strength
      and helps predict fracture. Vitamin D, a secosteroid that enhances calcium
      absorption, is commonly used to strengthen the skeletal system. OBJECTIVES: The
      present analysis aimed to determine the relationship between vitamin D levels and
      TBS by analyzing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
      (NHANES). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 4,464 people, including 2,148 males
      and 2,316 females, in our study. Subjects were analyzed by sex, obesity, and
      T-score subgroups using regression models. RESULTS: We noted a remarkably
      positive relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and TBS after the results were
      fully adjusted (beta:0.319; 95% CI: 0.145-0.494; P <0.001). T-score analysis
      showed that serum 25(OH)D levels were related to TBS in the normal (T-score > -1)
      group with 0.311 (95% CI: 0.097-0.525; P = 0.005). However, in the osteopenia
      (-2.5 < T-score < -1) and osteoporosis (T-score < -2.5) groups, there was no
      significant association between serum 25(OH)D levels and TBS (P > 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that low serum 25(OH)D levels may decrease the
      TBS, which represents skeletal microarchitecture and is a fracture risk factor in
      individuals with normal T scores.

TI  - Influence of cardiovascular risk burden on pulmonary function trajectory: role of
      physical and social activities.
LID - 10.18632/aging.204201 [doi]
AB  - The impact of cardiovascular risk burden on long-term trajectories of pulmonary
      function (PF) remains unclear. We examined the association of cardiovascular risk
      burden assessed by Framingham general cardiovascular risk score (FGCRS) with PF
      decline and explored whether cardiovascular diseases (CVD), physical and social
      activities play a role in the association. Within the Rush Memory and Aging
      Project, 1,442 participants (mean age:79.83) were followed up to 22 years. FGCRS 
      at baseline was calculated and categorized into tertiles. Composite PF was
      measured annually based on peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in one 
      second, and forced vital capacity. We found that the highest FGCRS was associated
      with faster PF decline (beta: -0.013, 95% CI: -0.023 to -0.003) compared with the
      lowest FGCRS. There were significant interactions between higher FGCRS and low
      level of physical/social activity (beta: -0.014, 95% CI: -0.026 to -0.003)/(beta:
      -0.020, 95% CI:-0.031 to -0.009) or CVD(beta: -0.023, 95% CI:-0.034 to -0.011)
      compared to the low FGCRS with high level of physical/social activity or without 
      CVD (P-interaction<0.05). Our results suggest that higher cardiovascular risk
      burden is associated with a faster PF decline, especially among people with CVD. 
      High level of physical activity and social activity appears to mitigate this
      association.

TI  - miRNA-338-3p inhibits the migration, invasion and proliferation of human lung
      adenocarcinoma cells by targeting MAP3K2.
LID - 10.18632/aging.204198 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of micro ribonucleic acid 
      (miR)-338-3p on the migration, invasion and proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma 
      (LUAD) cells. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis was employed to evaluate the
      function and expression of related genes in lung cancer. Human A549 and NCI-H1299
      cells cultured to logarithmic growth stage were assigned to negative control (NC)
      mimic group, miR-338-3p mimic group (miR-mimic group), NC inhibitor group and
      miR-338-3p inhibitor group (miR-inhibitor group) treated with or without MAP3K2
      overexpression (OE)-lentivirus, or TBHQ or FR180204. Transwell assay, cell colony
      formation assay, Western blotting and cell-cycle analysis were carried out.
      RESULTS: Bioinformatics results manifested that miR-338 and MAP3K2 were involved 
      in LUAD. The expression levels of MAP3K2, p-ERK1/2, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, cyclin
      A2 and cyclin D1 were increased after addition of miR-338-3p inhibitor,
      consistent with the raised amount of LUAD cells in migration and invasion
      experiments and number of colonies formed, as well as the cell cycle, but
      miR-338-3p mimic reversed these results. Moreover, MAP3K2 overexpression elevated
      the level of p-ERK1/2. Meanwhile, after treatment with TBHQ or FR180204, the
      influence of miR-338-3p inhibitor or mimic was also verified. CONCLUSIONS:
      MiR-338-3p overexpression can modulate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway by targeting 
      MAP3K2, thus inhibiting the migration, invasion and proliferation of human LUAD
      cells.

TI  - Treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms using the novel generation of
      flow-diverters with surface modification: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 15910199221117921
LID - 10.1177/15910199221117921 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surface modification of flow diverters (FDs) has been explored as a
      solution for reducing thrombotic risk of these devices, without necessarily using
      dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). If effective, this could pose a promising
      alternative for treatment of ruptured aneurysms not amenable to other modalities.
      METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase
      databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
      Meta-analyzes guidelines. We included articles reporting use of surface-modified 
      FDs for treatment of ruptured aneurysms. Demographics, subarachnoid hemorrhage
      (SAH) severity, aneurysm characteristics, devices used, periprocedural
      complications, angiographic outcomes, and mortality were extracted for sample
      size-based weighted analysis. RESULTS: Six studies comprising 59 patients with 64
      aneurysms were included. Mean patient age was 56.6 +/- 6.3 years and 60.6% (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 46.7-72.9%) were women. The anterior circulation was
      the location in 60.4% (95%CI, 45.5-73.5%) of aneurysms; 41.8% of the aneurysms
      were saccular (95%CI, 29.3-55.4%), 16.7% were fusiform (95%CI, 8.3-30.8%), 29.9% 
      were dissecting (95%CI, 12.8-55.4%), 24.4% were blood-blister (95%CI,
      15.2-36.7%), and 5.7% were mycotic (95%CI, 2-15.1%). Poor SAH grade was reported 
      in 46.9% (95%CI, 33.3-60.9%). Adjunctive coiling was used in 33.2% (95%CI,
      12.4-63.6%). Periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications occurred
      in 20% (95%CI, 7.1-45.1%) and 8.8% (95%CI, 3.7-19.5%), respectively. Complete
      occlusion was achieved in 76.4% (95%CI, 58.1-88.3%); no retreatments during
      follow-up were reported. Overall mortality was 15.1% (95%CI, 7.7-27.6%). There
      were no differences between single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) and DAPT regimens 
      with respect to periprocedural thromboembolic complications (P = 0.09),
      hemorrhagic (P = 0.834) complications, and mortality (P = 0.312). CONCLUSION:
      Surface-modified FD treatment of ruptured aneurysms resulted in high rates of
      thromboembolic complications and acceptable rates of hemorrhagic complications. A
      considerable proportion of aneurysms were nonsaccular. Rates of complete
      occlusion were high and retreatment were low. Importantly, no statistically
      significant difference was found between SAPT and DAPT with respect to
      complications and mortality.

TI  - Postoperative Packing of Perianal Abscess Cavities (PPAC2): randomized clinical
      trial.
LID - znac225 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bjs/znac225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perianal abscess is common. Traditionally, postoperative perianal
      abscess cavities are managed with internal wound packing, a practice not
      supported by evidence. The aim of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) was to
      assess if non-packing is less painful and if it is associated with adverse
      outcomes. METHODS: The Postoperative Packing of Perianal Abscess Cavities (PPAC2)
      trial was a multicentre, RCT (two-group parallel design) of adult participants
      admitted to an NHS hospital for incision and drainage of a primary perianal
      abscess. Participants were randomized 1:1 (via an online system) to receive
      continued postoperative wound packing or non-packing. Blinded data were collected
      via symptom diaries, telephone, and clinics over 6 months. The objective was to
      determine whether non-packing of perianal abscess cavities is less painful than
      packing, without an increase in perianal fistula or abscess recurrence. The
      primary outcome was pain (mean maximum pain score on a 100-point visual analogue 
      scale). RESULTS: Between February 2018 and March 2020, 433 participants (mean age
      42 years) were randomized across 50 sites. Two hundred and thirteen participants 
      allocated to packing reported higher pain scores than 220 allocated to
      non-packing (38.2 versus 28.2, mean difference 9.9; P < 0.0001). The occurrence
      of fistula-in-ano was low in both groups: 32/213 (15 per cent) in the packing
      group and 24/220 (11 per cent) in the non-packing group (OR 0.69, 95 per cent
      c.i. 0.39 to 1.22; P = 0.20). The proportion of patients with abscess recurrence 
      was also low: 13/223 (6 per cent) in the non-packing group and 7/213 (3 per cent)
      in the packing group (OR 1.85, 95 per cent c.i. 0.72 to 4.73; P = 0.20).
      CONCLUSION: Avoiding abscess cavity packing is less painful without a negative
      morbidity risk. REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN93273484

TI  - Determination of carcinogenic primary aromatic amines contained as impurities in 
      synthetic organic colorants.
LID - qsac095 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jaoacint/qsac095 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several primary aromatic amines (PAAs) have been designated
      carcinogenic or suspected of carcinogenicity. Several kinds of PAAs may occur
      either via the reduction of azo compounds or as impurities in azo colorants or
      other agents. OBJECTIVE: Analytical method was developed and applied to determine
      whether certain PAAs are present as impurities in synthetic organic colorants.
      METHODS: Target chemicals were analyzed by the ultrasound extraction of the
      synthetic organic colorant with a hydrochloric acid solution containing 20%
      methanol, followed by conversion from an acidic to alkaline solution, and then
      extraction using a diatomaceous earth column. RESULTS: We analyzed certain PAAs
      in 38 synthetic organic colorants, resulting in the detection of
      2,4-dimethylaniline in 4 samples at 1.2 to 19 mug/g, o-toluidine in 3 samples at 
      1.0 to 3.4 mug/g, p-phenylazoaniline in 2 samples at 74 to 305 mug/g, and, in one
      sample each, 2,4,5-trimethylaniline (13 mug/g), 5-nitro-o-toluidine (12 mug/g),
      and 2-methyl-4-(2-tolylazo)aniline (13 mug/g). Nearly all PAAs were determined to
      be starting materials for colorant synthesis, although p-phenylazoaniline in
      Yellow No. 407 was apparently a byproduct formed during synthesis. For Red No.
      225, in which high concentrations of p-phenylazoaniline were detected, additional
      samples were purchased from five companies, and p-phenylazoaniline was detected
      at concentrations of 88 to 370 mug/g in all samples. CONCLUSION: A method to
      analyze certain PAAs contained as impurities in synthetic organic colorants was
      developed, and the actual status of them in colorants was clarified. HIGHLIGHTS: 
      The analytical method developed in this study for the determination of certain
      PAAs contained as impurities in synthetic organic colorants may be used to
      improve the safety of colorants.

TI  - Clinical event rate in patients with and without left main disease undergoing
      isolated CABG: results from the European DuraGraft registry.
LID - ezac403 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezac403 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) is considered an
      independent risk factor for clinical events after coronary artery bypass grafting
      (CABG). We have conducted a subgroup analysis of the multicentre European
      DuraGraft registry to investigate clinical event-rates at 1-year in patients with
      and without LMCAD undergoing isolated CABG in contemporary practice. METHODS:
      Patients undergoing isolated CABG were selected. The primary end-point was the
      incidence of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) defined as the composite of
      death, myocardial infarction (MI) or repeat revascularization (RR) at 1-year. The
      secondary end-point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) 
      defined as MACE plus stroke. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to
      balance for differences in baseline characteristics. RESULTS: LMCAD was present
      in 1,033 (41.2%) and absent in 1,477 (58.8%) patients. At 1-year, the MACE rate
      was higher for LMCAD patients (8.2% vs 5.1%, p = 0.002) driven by higher rates of
      death (5.4% vs 3.4%, p = 0.016), MI (3.0% vs 1.3%, p = 0.002) and numerically
      higher rates of RR (2.8% vs 1.8%, p = 0.13). The incidence of MACCE was 8.8% vs
      6.6%, p = 0.043 with a stroke rate of 1.0% and 2.4%, p = 0.011, for LMCAD and
      non-LMCAD group, respectively. After PSM, the MACE rate was 8.0% vs 5.2%, p =
      0.015. The incidence of death was 5.1% vs 3.7%, p = 0.10, MI 3.0% vs 1.4%, p =
      0.020, and RR was 2.7% vs 1.6%, p = 0.090, for the LMCAD and non-LMCAD group,
      respectively. Less strokes occurred in LMCAD patients (1.0% vs 2.4%, p = 0.017). 
      The MACCE rate was not different: 8.5% vs 6.7%, p = 0.12. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      large registry, LMCAD was demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for MACE 
      after isolated CABG. Conversely, the risk of stroke was lower in LMCAD patients.

TI  - Transamidated wheat gliadin induces differential antigen recognition in the small
      intestine of HLA/DQ8 transgenic mice.
LID - 10.1039/d2fo02032g [doi]
AB  - A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only available therapy for
      coeliac disease (CD). However, GFD compliance is difficult and alternative
      strategies are envisaged in the near future. We previously found that wheat
      gliadin following transamidation by microbial transglutaminase (mTG) does not
      induce IFN-gamma secretion by intestinal T cells from CD patients. Fully
      transamidated gliadin with lysine ethyl ester can be recovered in a soluble
      protein fraction (spf) generated by the enzymatic treatment of wheat flour.
      Herein, we analysed the performance of transamidation by mTG on a pilot-scale
      (1L) by evaluating the reaction kinetics and its biological effect on the
      intestinal immune response in HLA/DQ8 transgenic mice, a model of gluten
      sensitivity. At 1 h, all gliadin fractions showed a faster electrophoretic
      mobility by acid-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE) following
      transamidation in comparison with their native counterparts. In parallel, the
      yield of residual native gliadin dropped (30% at 180 min), confirming our
      previous findings on a lab scale. Mucosal sensitisation of mice with gliadin via 
      the intranasal route induced a Th1 phenotype in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs).
      Importantly, IFN-gamma secretion was significantly reduced when gliadin-specific 
      MLN cells were challenged in vitro with spf (P < 0.001). Multiplex analysis
      revealed that the adaptive immune response evoked by spf involved a distinct cell
      population characterised by secretion of IL-2, IL-3 and IL-5. Notably, spf
      stimulated in vitro a reduced or null secretion of all of the examined
      pro-inflammatory markers mainly associated to innate immunity. In conclusion, our
      data revealed the ability of transamidated gliadin to modulate both innate and
      adaptive mechanisms involved in the inflammatory response induced by wheat
      gliadin in the small intestine of DQ8 mice.

TI  - Sperm degradation after vasectomy follows a sperm chromatin fragmentation
      dependent mechanism causing DNA breaks in the toroid linker regions.
LID - gaac029 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/molehr/gaac029 [doi]
AB  - Vasectomy is a widely used surgical technique creating an obstructive
      azoospermia. Although sperm cannot be ejaculated, the testis maintains sperm
      production in vasectomized males. The continuous accumulation of sperm deposited 
      in the epididymis and the vas deferens fraction necessarily need to be degraded
      and eliminated. While the elimination process is carried out by granulomas that
      form after vasectomy, the detailed mechanisms of sperm degradation are still not 
      known. The aim was to assess whether sperm chromatin fragmentation (SCF), a
      mechanism that degrades the entire sperm genome at the toroid linker regions
      (TLR), is activated after vasectomy in sperm cells. We vasectomized mice and
      evaluated the presence of TLR-specific double-strand breaks through pulsed-field 
      gel electrophoresis and the Comet assay at 1, 2 and 3 weeks after surgery.
      Results for DNA damage (Olive tail moment) at single-cell level showed an
      increase of double-strand breaks after vasectomy for vas deferens sperm after 1, 
      2 and 3 weeks post-vasectomy (21.78 +/- 2.29; 19.71 +/- 1.79 and 32.59 +/- 1.81, 
      respectively), compared to mock surgery (7.04 +/- 1.03; 10.10 +/- 1.29 and 8.64
      +/- 0.85, respectively; P < 0.001). Similar findings were obtained for cauda
      epididymis sperm (P < 0.001), but not for caput epididymis (P > 0.05).
      Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed the presence of double-stranded breaks
      between 15 kb and 145 kb, indicating that DNA breaks were produced mainly in the 
      sperm TLRs. Results presented here suggest that SCF is a mechanism activated in
      vas deferens after vasectomy to degrade sperm DNA when they cannot be ejaculated,
      preventing their function.

TI  - Varus Knee Limits Pain Relief Effects of Laterally Wedged Insoles and Ankle-Foot 
      Orthoses in Medial Knee Osteoarthritis.
PG  - jrm00324
LID - 10.2340/jrm.v54.1129 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of varus malalignment of the knee on pain
      reduction achieved by an ankle-foot orthosis and a laterally wedged insole in
      patients with medial knee osteoarthritis. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a
      randomized, clinically prospective cross-over study. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight
      participants with medial knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: All participants wore a
      5-mm laterally wedged insole and an ankle-foot orthosis for a period of 6 weeks
      each in a randomized order. Pain was reported on a numerical rating scale and was
      correlated with limb alignment, as defined by the mechanical axis deviation in
      full-leg standing radiographs. RESULTS: Insole and orthosis use reduced pain
      compared with baseline (median knee pain change: insole -0.5 (? -5 to +6),
      orthosis -1.5 (-7 to +5). A higher mechanical axis deviation (greater varus)
      correlated significantly with smaller pain reduction for both aids (insole p =
      0.003, orthosis p < 0.001). A cut-off to predict pain response was found at a
      mechanical axis deviation of 14-15 mm for both aids, i.e. > 3 degrees knee varus.
      CONCLUSION: There is a correlation between varus malalignment and pain reduction.
      There seems to be a mechanical axis deviation cut-off that predicts the response 
      to treatment with the aids with good sensitivity.

TI  - Evaluation of the blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a biomarker for
      meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology in dogs.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16512 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been identified as a
      biomarker in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Multiple sclerosis
      (MS) has been found to be associated with changes in the NLR in humans.
      OBJECTIVES: To examine the diagnostic value of the NLR in meningoencephalitis of 
      unknown etiology (MUE) in dogs. ANIMALS: Thirty-eight MUE dogs, 20 hydrocephalic 
      dogs, 10 brain tumor (BT) dogs, 32 idiopathic epilepsy (IE) dogs, and 41 healthy 
      dogs. METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records were reviewed to identify
      dogs with a diagnosis of neurologic disease. The NLR was determined in all dogs. 
      RESULTS: The median NLR was significantly higher in MUE dogs (6.08) than in
      healthy (1.78, P < .001), IE (2.50, P < .05), and hydrocephalic dogs (1.79, P <
      .05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the NLR for
      differentiation between MUE and healthy dogs was 0.96, and between the MUE dogs
      and dogs with other forebrain diseases was 0.86. An optimal cutoff of 4.16 for
      the NLR had a sensitivity of 71.1% and specificity of 83.9% to differentiate the 
      MUE dogs from the dogs with other forebrain diseases. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL
      IMPORTANCE: The NLR could be a biomarker for diagnosing MUE and distinguishing it
      from other intracranial diseases in dogs.

TI  - Single Modified Posterior Approach through the Space of the Proximal Radioulnar
      Joint for Terrible Triad Injury: A Comparative Study.
LID - 10.1111/os.13430 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to reduce surgical scars and the risk of neurovascular injury
      for the treatment of terrible triad injuries of the elbow (TTI), minimally
      invasive and better therapeutic effect approaches are being explored to replace
      the conventional combined lateral and medial approach (CLMA). This study was
      performed to compare the clinical effect and security of the modified posterior
      approach (MPA) through the space of the proximal radioulnar joint vs the CLMA for
      treatment of TTI. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 76 patients
      treated for TTI from January 2009 to December 2020 (MPA: n = 44; CLMA: n = 32).
      Treatment involved plate and screw fixation or Steinmann pin fixation for the
      radial head and ulnar coronoid process fractures. Surgeons only sutured the
      lateral ligament because the medial collateral ligament was usually integrated in
      the TTI. The continuous variables were compared by the independent Student t-test
      and the categorical variables by the chi(2) -test or Fisher's exact test.
      RESULTS: Both groups of patients attained a satisfactory MEPS after the
      operation. The MEPS (MPA: 96.82 +/- 6.04 vs CLMA: 96.56 +/- 5.51) was not
      significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, the MPA
      resulted in better elbow flexion and extension (MPA: 123.98 +/- 10.09 vs CLMA:
      117.66 +/- 8.29), better forearm rotation function (MPA: 173.41 +/- 6.81 vs CLMA:
      120.00 +/- 12.18), and less intraoperative hemoglobin (MPA: 9.34 +/- 5.64 vs
      CLMA: 16.5 +/- 8.75) and red cell volume loss (MPA: 3.09 +/- 2.20 vs CLMA: 6.70
      +/- 2.97) (All p < 0.05). Although the CLMA had a shorter surgery time (MPA:
      171.73 +/- 80.68 vs CLMA: 130.16 +/- 71.50) (p < 0.05), it had a higher risk of
      neurologic damage (MPA: 0 vs CLMA: 4) (p < 0.05). Four patients developed forearm
      or hand numbness after the CLMA, but no patients developed numbness after the
      MPA. All 76 patients were followed up for 15 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION: 
      The MPA through the space of the proximal radioulnar joint has more prominent
      advantages than the CLMA for TTI, including single scar, clear exposure, good
      fixation, lower risk of neurovascular injury, and better elbow joint motion. It
      is a safe and effective surgical approach that is worthy of clinical promotion.

TI  - Applications of the Crenel Lateral Interbody Fusion Procedure in Treatment for
      Adjacent Segments Degeneration of the Lumbar Spine.
LID - 10.1111/os.13420 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical and radiological effect of crenel lateral
      interbody fusion (CLIF) procedure in the management of lumbar spine adjacent
      segment degenerative (ASD). METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with lumbar spine ASD 
      who underwent the CLIF procedure between June 2018 and December 2019 were
      included in the study. There were 13 males and 24 females, with a mean age of
      64.30 +/- 5.92 years. The VAS score of the back (VAS_Back) and legs (VAS_Leg),
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score, the height of the intervertebral space
      (HIS), the height of the intervertebral foramen (HIF), the cross-sectional area
      (CSA) of the vertebral canal, segmental lordosis (SL), and lumbar lordosis (LL)
      were recorded before the operation, 2 weeks after the operation, 3 months after
      the operation, and at the last follow-up respectively. Clinical and radiological 
      outcomes before and after the surgery were compared, and correlation and
      regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: There were no vascular and
      nerve-related complications during the operation. The average follow-up time was 
      16.63 +/- 4.24 months. The median of both VAS_Back and VAS_Leg was 7 before
      surgery and 1 at the last follow-up. Meanwhile, the average preoperative ODI
      score, HIS, HIF, CSA of the vertebral canal, LL, and SL was (67.48 +/- 7.17) %,
      (4.80 +/- 0.73) mm, (12.95 +/- 2.07) mm, (59.52 +/- 9.22) mm(2) , (37.22 +/-
      5.92) degrees and (4.78 +/- 1.99) degrees , respectively. At the final follow-up,
      ODI score, HIS, HIF, CSA of the vertebral canal, LL, and SL was (7.07 +/- 2.66)
      %, (9.44 +/- 0.61) mm, (17.30 +/- 1.90) mm, (70.49 +/- 8.95) mm(2) , (44.67 +/-
      6.38) degrees and (13.44 +/- 3.27) degrees , respectively. In the VAS_Back,
      VAS_Leg, ODI score, LL, SL, HIS, HIF, and CSA of the vertebral canal, the
      difference between preoperative and 2 weeks after the operation, 3 months after
      the operation, and the last follow-up were statistically significant (P < 0.05). 
      However, the difference was not statistically significant between each time point
      after the operation in the CSA of the vertebral canal, LL, and SL (P > 0.05).
      Nonetheless, the difference was statistically significant in ODI between each
      time point after the operation (P < 0.05). VAS_Leg was associated with HIS, HIF, 
      and CSA of the vertebral canal, while LL and SL were risk factors for low back
      pain. CONCLUSION: Crenel lateral interbody fusion is an effective procedure in
      the management of lumbar ASD. Not only was the postoperative swift recovery due
      to minimal invasion, but also adequate LL and SL were achievable.

TI  - Clinical spectrum of rectal cancer identifies hallmarks of early-onset patients
      and next-generation treatment strategies.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing among young adults
      and more rectal cancers are reported. This study aimed to identify the clinical
      features specific for early-onset rectal cancer and provide insights on cancer
      management. METHODS: Early-onset (<50 years) and late-onset (>/=50 years) rectal 
      cancer patients from a referral tertiary care center (SYSU cohort) and
      Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database (SEER cohort) were included to
      perform a comprehensive comparison on clinical information. RESULTS: A total of
      552 and 80,341 patients with stages I-III rectal cancer were included in the SYSU
      and SEER cohorts, respectively. In the SYSU cohort, early-onset diseases had
      significantly higher prevalence of family history of cancer and history of HBV
      infection and lower incidence of comorbidities (p < 0.05). In addition,
      early-onset patients presented more frequently with advanced node stage (N2
      stage: 16.9 vs. 9.3%, p = 0.017) and high-risk features, including mucinous or
      signet cell carcinomas (21.8 vs. 12.9%, p = 0.014), poorly differentiated tumors 
      (28.8 vs. 15.4%, p = 0.002), and perineural invasion (14.5 vs. 7.9%, p = 0.027)
      compared with late-onset patients. However, early-onset patients received more
      neoadjuvant (18.5 vs. 11.2%, p = 0.032) and adjuvant treatments (71.0 vs. 45.8%, 
      p < 0.001), and they had better overall survival in both SYSU (HR 0.57, 95% CI:
      0.34-0.95; p = 0.029) and SEER (HR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.37-0.40; p < 0.001) cohorts.
      CONCLUSION: Early-onset rectal cancers are distinct from late-onset cases in
      clinicopathological features, treatment modalities, and outcomes. The clinical
      trials and studies that are specific for young populations are needed to develop 
      optimal strategies for cancer screening, treatment, and surveillance.

TI  - Prognostic role of targeted methylation analysis in paraffin-embedded samples of 
      adrenocortical carcinoma.
LID - dgac470 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac470 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare aggressive disease with
      heterogeneous prognosis. Previous studies identified hypermethylation in the
      promoter region of specific genes to be associated with poor clinical outcome.
      OBJECTIVE: Comparative analysis of promising hypermethylated genes as prognostic 
      markers and evaluation of their added value to established clinical prognostic
      tools. DESIGN: We included 237 patients with ACCs. Tumor DNA was isolated from
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Targeted pyrosequencing was used
      to detect promoter region methylation in 5 preselected genes (PAX5, GSTP1,
      PYCARD, PAX6, G0S2). The prognostic role of hypermethylation pattern was compared
      to S-GRAS score. Primary endpoints were progression-free (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS), with disease-free (DFS) as secondary endpoint. RESULTS: 27.9%,
      13.9%, 49%, 49% and 25.3% of cases showed hypermethylation in PAX5, GSTP1,
      PYCARD, PAX6, and G0S2, respectively. Hypermethylation in all individual genes - 
      except GSTP1 - was significantly associated with both PFS and OS - with Hazard
      Ratios (HR) between 1.4 and 2.3. However, only hypermethylation of PAX5 remained 
      significantly associated with OS (p=0.013; HR=1.95, 95%CI 1.2-3.3) in
      multivariable analysis. A model for risk stratification was developed, combining 
      PAX5 methylation status and S-GRAS groups, showing improved prognostic
      performance compared to S-GRAS alone (Harrell's C index: OS=0.751, PFS=0.711,
      DFS=0.688). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that hypermethylation in PAX5 is
      associated with worst clinical outcome in ACC, even after accounting for S-GRAS
      score. Assessing methylation in FFPE material is straightforward in the clinical 
      setting and could be used to improve accuracy of prognostic classification,
      enabling the direction of personalized management.

TI  - Clinical and Molecular Analysis of Recurrent Gram-Negative Bloodstream
      Infections.
LID - ciac638 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac638 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The causes and clinical characteristics of recurrent gram-negative
      bacterial bloodstream infections (GNB-BSI) are poorly understood. METHODS: We
      used a prospectively ascertained cohort of patients with GNB-BSI to identify
      clinical characteristics, microbiology, and risk factors associated with
      recurrent GNB-BSI. Bacterial genotyping (both pulsed field gel electrophoresis
      [PFGE] and whole genome sequencing [WGS]) was used to define whether these
      episodes were due to relapse or reinfection. Multivariable logistic regression
      was used to identify risk factors associated with recurrence. RESULTS: Of the
      1423 patients with GNB-BSI that met criteria for inclusion in this study, 60 (4%)
      had recurrent GNB-BSI. Non-white race (OR: 2.35; CI95% 1.38-4.01; p = 0.002),
      admission to a surgical service (OR: 2.18; CI95% 1.26-3.75; p = 0.005) and
      presence of an indwelling cardiac device (OR: 2.73; CI95% 1.21-5.58, p = 0.009)
      were associated with increased risk for recurrent GNB-BSI. Among the 48 patients 
      with recurrent GNB-BSI whose paired bloodstream isolates underwent genotyping,
      63% were due to relapse (30/48) and 38% were due to reinfection (18/48) based on 
      WGS. Compared with WGS, PFGE correctly differentiated relapse and reinfection in 
      98% (47/48) of cases. Median time to relapse and reinfection was similar (113
      days [IQR: 35-222 days] vs. 174 days [IQR: 69-599 days], p = 0.13). Presence of a
      cardiac device was associated with relapse (Relapse: 7/27 [26%]; Non-relapse:
      65/988 [7%]; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, recurrent GNB-BSI was most
      commonly due to relapse. PFGE accurately differentiated relapse from reinfection 
      when compared with WGS. Presence of a cardiac device was a risk factor for
      relapse.

TI  - The lncRNA39896-miR166b-HDZs module affects tomato resistance to Phytophthora
      infestans.
LID - 10.1111/jipb.13339 [doi]
AB  - The yield and quality of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) is seriously affected by
      Phytophthora infestans. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Sl-lncRNA39896 is
      induced after P. infestans infection and was previously predicted to act as an
      endogenous target mimic (eTM) for the microRNA (miRNA) Sl-miR166b, which function
      in stress responses. Here, we further examined the role of Sl-lncRNA39896 and
      Sl-miR166b in tomato resistance to P. infestans. Sl-miR166b levels were higher in
      Sl-lncRNA39896-knockout mutants than in wild-type plants, and the mutants
      displayed enhanced resistance to P. infestans. A six-point mutation in the region
      of Sl-lncRNA39896 that binds to Sl-miR166b disabled the interaction, suggesting
      that Sl-lncRNA39896 acts as an eTM for Sl-miR166b. Overexpressing Sl-miR166b
      yielded a similar phenotype to that produced by Sl-lncRNA39896-knockout, whereas 
      silencing of Sl-miR166b impaired resistance. We verified that Sl-miR166b cleaved 
      transcripts of its target class III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes SlHDZ34 and 
      SlHDZ45. Silencing of SlHDZ34/45 decreased pathogen accumulation in plants
      infected with P. infestans. Additionally, jasmonic acid and ethylene contents
      were elevated following infection in the plants with enhanced resistance.
      Sl-lncRNA39896 is the first known lncRNA to negatively regulate resistance to P. 
      infestans in tomato. We propose a novel mechanism in which the
      lncRNA39896-miR166b-HDZ module modulates resistance to P. infestans. This article

TI  - Analysis of the Effect of Antibiotic Bone Cement in the Treatment of Diabetic
      Foot Ulcer through Tibia Transverse Transport.
LID - 10.1111/os.13412 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of antibiotic bone cement (ABC) combined with 
      the modified tibial transverse transport (mTTT) on the treatment of severe
      diabetic foot with infection. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted
      of 243 patients with TEXAS grade 3/4 stage D diabetic foot ulcers from December
      2016 to December 2019. A total of 115 patients treated with mTTT were classified 
      as the mTTT group (78 male and 37 female, mean age: 70.4 +/- 6 years) and 128
      patients who were treated with ABC combined with mTTT were in the ABC + mTTT
      group (89 male and 39 female, mean age: 68.9 +/- 8 years). Follow-up records
      during treatment and 6 months after surgery were collected, including the time
      required for white blood cells (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to return to
      normal range, wound healing time, pain visual analog scale (VAS), ankle-brachial 
      index (ABI), foot skin temperature, transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement
      (TcPO2 ), complications, and other indicators. Normally distributed data were
      compared using the independent sample t-test, non-normally distributed data were 
      analyzed by one-way ANOVA analysis of variance. RESULTS: There were 128 cases in 
      the ABC + mTTT group (89 male and 39 female, mean age: 68.9 +/- 8 years) treated 
      with ABC and mTTT, and 115 cases in the TTT group (78 male and 37 female, mean
      age: 70.4 +/- 6 years) treated with mTTT alone. The time required for WBC and CRP
      to return to the normal range and wound healing time in the ABC + mTTT group were
      significantly shorter than those in the mTTT group (12.9 +/- 4.6 vs. 22.6 +/- 1.6
      days, t = 3.979, p < 0.001; 25.3 +/- 1.3 vs. 31.3 +/- 2.3 days, t = 4.261, p =
      0.001; 11.9 +/- 3.8 vs. 15.9 +/- 3.9 days, t = 4.539, p < 0.001). There were no
      significant intergroup differences in the foot skin temperature, VAS score, ABI, 
      and TcPO2 (t = 0.349, 0.542, 0.765, 0.693 while all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION:
      Although the application of ABC with mTTT for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers
      did not affect the wound healing time and ankle blood supply in the mid-term, it 
      could control ulcer infection faster and accelerate wound healing.

TI  - In-Hospital Costs for Open versus Endoscopic Endonasal Approach for
      Craniopharyngioma Resection.
LID - 10.1002/lary.30313 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the in-hospital cost implications of an expanded
      endoscopic endonasal approach (EEEA) for craniopharyngioma resection relative to 
      the traditional open transcranial approach. METHODS: All craniopharyngioma
      surgeries performed at a single institution over a period from January 1st 2001
      to October 31th 2017 were evaluated. The electronic medical record was reviewed
      for patient factors, tumor characteristics, and cost variables associated with
      each hospital stay and univariate regression analysis was performed using R
      software. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients met study criteria, including 22
      undergoing an open approach and 14 undergoing an EEEA. There was a significantly 
      longer average length of stay among patients undergoing open resection (21.5 vs. 
      10.6 days, p = 0.024). The average total in-hospital cost of a patient undergoing
      an EEEA was $58979.3 compared to $89142.3 for an open approach (p = 0.127). On
      univariate regression analysis, the total in-hospital cost for a patient
      undergoing an open approach relative to an EEEA was $30163.0 (p = 0.127). The
      open approach was exclusively performed from study onset until April 2010 (16
      patients). From April 2010 to August 2013, 6 open approaches and 5 EEEA were
      performed. The EEEA has been exclusively performed from August 2013 until the
      conclusion of our study period (9 patients). CONCLUSIONS: There has been a shift 
      toward surgical resection of craniopharyngioma via an EEEA approach for amenable 
      tumors. Our study demonstrates that the EEEA has become the preferred surgical
      approach at our institution, and shows that the EEEA is associated with shorter
      postoperative length of stay and lower total in-hospital cost. Laryngoscope,

TI  - Sub-regional trend of HIV infection among antenatal clinic attendees in Andhra
      Pradesh (2003-2019).
LID - 10.2174/1570162X20666220805090501 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Analysis of local risks at sub-national levels and tailored
      interventions are being emphasized for effective HIV management. Andhra Pradesh
      (AP) is a high HIV prevalence state in India, with the second-highest number of
      people with HIV (PWH) and a consistent decline in HIV prevalence at the state
      level. Probing further into the region and district-wise levels and trends of HIV
      prevalence will provide critical insights into sub-regional epidemic patterns.
      Hence, this paper analyzes the regional and district-level trends of HIV
      prevalence among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics (ANC) from 2003
      to 2019 in AP, South India. METHODS: HIV prevalence data collected from pregnant 
      women in AP during HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) between 2003 and 2019 was used
      for trend analysis. The consistent sites were grouped into three regions (Coastal
      Andhra, Rayalaseema and Uttar Andhra), totaling 39 sites, including 21 rural and 
      18 urban sites. Regional and district-level HIV prevalence was analyzed using the
      Chi-square trend test, and spatial analysis was done using QGIS software. For the
      last three HSS rounds, HIV prevalence based on sociodemographic variables was
      calculated to understand the factors contributing to HIV positivity in each
      region. RESULTS: In total, 143,211 pregnant women were recruited. HIV prevalence 
      in AP was 0.30% (95% CI: 0.22 - 0.39) in 2019. The prevalence was 0.31%, 0.35%
      and 0.22% in Coastal Andhra, Rayalaseema and Uttar Andhra, respectively. HIV
      prevalence had significantly (P < 0.05) declined in all regions. The overall
      trend indicated that the HIV prevalence was higher among older pregnant women and
      in urban regions. However, recent trends consistently report HIV positivity among
      young and new pregnant mothers, illiterates, and rural regions. CONCLUSION: The
      overall trend indicated that the HIV prevalence was higher among older pregnant
      women and in urban regions. However, recent trends consistently report HIV
      positivity among young and new pregnant mothers, illiterates, and rural regions. 
      Identifying the contextual risk patterns associated with HIV transmission will
      further improve HIV preventive and management programs among the general
      population.

TI  - Assessing the Influence of Salvia Triloba on Memory Deficit Caused by Sleep
      Deprivation in the context of Oxidative Stress.
LID - 10.2174/1567205019666220805092450 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Learning and memory deficit has been reported to be correlated to the
      oxidative mutilation in the hippocampus. Moreover, sleep deprivation (SD)
      mitigates memory via distressing oxidative stress balance. In the current report,
      the prospective neuroprotective role of oral sage (Salvia triloba) extract on
      cognitive impairment induced by chronic SD was investigated. METHODS: The SD was 
      induced in adult male Wistar rats employing a modified multiple platform (8
      h/day; for six weeks). Simultaneously, S. triloba extract (375 mg/kg, orally) was
      administered for six weeks. Thereafter, Radial Arm Water Maze test was utilized
      to evaluate the spatial learning and memory. Moreover, activities of different
      hippocampal antioxidant parameters: glutathione peroxidase (GPx), oxidized
      glutathione (GSSG), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase, superoxide dismutase
      (SOD), and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) were measured in
      rats' hippocampus. Moreover, the level of brain derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF) was assessed. RESULTS: Current results illustrate that chronic SD
      significantly compromised both memories, both short- and long- term, while sage
      extract inhibited these consequences. Moreover, sage extract remarkably
      stabilized the antioxidants enzyme levels which were decreased by SD such as:
      SOD, catalase, and GPx (P < 0.05), and remarkably augmented the GSH/GSSG ratio in
      SD rats (P < 0.05). However, no substantial alterations of GSH, TBARS or BDNF
      levels (P > 0.05) were seen with sage extract administration. CONCLUSION: Chronic
      treatment with sage extract (S. Triloba) precluded SD-induced memory impairment
      by regularizing antioxidant parameters levels in rats' hippocampus.

TI  - The Effect of Intensity of Conditioning Regimen on The Outcome of Hsct in
      Children with Sickle Cell Disease.
PG  - e14787
LID - 10.1111/ctr.14787 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) provides a 
      cure for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study describes the effect
      of conditioning regimen intensity on HSCT outcomes among children younger than 14
      years with SCD. METHODS: Transplants from HLA-matched related donors (MRD) and
      unrelated donors (MUD) using either myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens or 
      reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens were considered. Event-free
      survival (EFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included overall
      survival (OS) and occurrence of GVHD. RESULTS: 48 SCD patients underwent HSCT, 45
      (93.8%) patients had MRD, 1 (2.1%) had 9/10 related donor, and 2 (4.1%) had MUD. 
      The median age at transplant was 8.6 years (range, 3.1-13.8). Conditioning
      regimens were myeloablative (MAC) in 41 (85.4%) patients and of reduced intensity
      in 7 (14.6%) patients. EFS at two years was 100% among MAC group compared to 29% 
      in the RIC group (P<0.001). The median follow-up was 43.4 months (range
      26.8-134). All events in the RIC group were secondary graft failure. However, OS 
      was 100% in both groups at two years. Acute GVHD II-IV was diagnosed in 2 (4.1%) 
      patients. Chronic GVHD occurred in 2 (4.1%) patients. GVHD did not occur in
      patients who underwent MUD HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: MAC in children with SCD is well
      tolerated and associated with an excellent outcome for HLA-matched HSCT in SCD.
      There was a high rate of secondary graft failure with the use of RIC. Future
      studies are needed to optimize RIC regimens in HSCT of children with SCD. This

TI  - Bioactive synergism between zinc mineral and p-coumaric acid: A multi-mode
      glycemic control and antioxidative study.
PG  - e14360
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14360 [doi]
AB  - Natural supplements are important in diabetes and oxidative stress management. A 
      complexation-mediated antihyperglycemic and antioxidant synergism between
      zinc(II) and p-coumaric acid was investigated. p-Coumaric acid was complexed with
      ZnSO4 and characterized by FT-IR, (1) H NMR, and mass spectroscopy. The
      antioxidant and antihyperglycemic potential of the complex and precursors were
      evaluated with different experimental models. Molecular docking with target
      proteins linked to diabetes was performed. A Zn(II)-bicoumarate.2H2 O complex was
      formed. The in vitro radical scavenging, alpha-glucosidase inhibitory,
      antiglycation, and anti-lipid peroxidative activities of the complex were several
      folds stronger than p-coumaric acid. In Chang liver cells and rat liver tissues, 
      the complex inhibited lipid peroxidation (IC50 = 56.2 and 398 muM) and GSH
      depletion (IC50 = 33.9 and 38.7 muM), which was significantly stronger
      (2.3-5.4-folds) than p-coumaric acid and comparable to ascorbic acid. Zn(II) and 
      p-coumaric synergistically modulated (1.7- and 2.8-folds than p-coumaric acid)
      glucose uptake in L-6 myotubes (EC50 = 10.7 muM) and rat muscle tissue (EC50 =
      428 muM), which may be linked to the observed complexation-mediated increase in
      tissue zinc uptake. Glucose uptake activity was accompanied by increased
      hexokinase activity, suggesting increased glucose utilization. Docking scores
      alpha-glucosidase, GLUT-4, and PKB/Akt showed stronger interaction with the
      complex (-6.31 to -6.41 kcal/mol) compared to p-coumaric acid (-7.18 to -7.74
      kcal/mol), which was influenced by the Zn(II) and bicoumarate moieties of the
      complex. In vitro, the complex was not hepatotoxic or myotoxic. Zn(II)
      complexation may be a therapeutic approach for improving the antioxidative and
      glycemic control potentials of p-coumaric acid. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In
      functional medicine, natural supplements, plant-derived phenolics, and
      nutraceuticals are becoming popular in the management of diseases, including
      diabetes and oxidative stress. This has been largely attributed to their
      perceived holistic medicinal profile and the absence of notable toxicity
      concerns. In the past two decades, considerable attention has been drawn toward
      zinc mineral as a possible therapeutic supplement for diabetes due to its role in
      insulin secretion and reported insulin mimetic potentials. p-Coumaric acid is a
      known natural antioxidant with reported diabetes-related pharmacological effects.
      In this study, we took advantage of these properties and complexed both natural
      supplements, which resulted in a more potent nutraceutical with improved glycemic
      control and antioxidant potential. The complexation-mediated synergistic
      interaction between zinc and p-coumaric acid could be an important therapeutic
      approach in improving the use of these natural supplements or nutraceuticals in
      managing diabetes and associated oxidative complications.

TI  - Effect of Age on the Patterns of Traumatic Femoral Fractures: Seven Years of
      Experience at a Regional Tertiary Hospital.
LID - 10.1111/os.13410 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Femoral fractures are a common cause of mortality and functional loss,
      mainly among older people, and there are few studies about the age in relation to
      traumatic femoral fractures. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect 
      of age on the patterns of traumatic femoral fractures in patients presenting to
      our regional tertiary hospital. METHODS: The records of 2020 patients who
      presented with traumatic femoral fractures between 2013 and 2019 were
      retrospectively reviewed. The patients' clinical and radiographic records were
      reviewed. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify 
      independent risk factors for associated injuries and complications. RESULTS: The 
      patients were divided into a child group (CH group, n = 342) aged under 18 years,
      a young adult group (YA group, n = 484) aged 18-60 years, and an older people
      group (OP group, n = 1194) aged 60 years and over. There were significant
      differences among the three groups in several indexes, such as sex ratio (chi(2) 
      = 301.699, p < 0.001), osteoporosis (chi(2) = 375.463, p < 0.001), injury time of
      day (chi(2) = 114.913, p < 0.001), injury cause (chi(2) = 748.187, p < 0.001),
      injury location (chi(2) = 490.153, p < 0.001), fracture side (chi(2) = 57.000, p 
      < 0.001), fracture site (chi(2) = 806.650, p < 0.001), associated injuries
      (chi(2) = 322.921, p < 0.001), coma after injury (chi(2) = 147.814, p < 0.001),
      non-surgery-related complications (chi(2) = 7.895, p = 0.019), and
      surgery-related complications (chi(2) = 82.186, p < 0.001). The YA group had a
      significantly higher percentage of patients with surgery-related complications
      than the OP group. The OP group had a higher frequency of non-surgery-related
      complications than the YA group and CH group. The most common non-surgery-related
      complications were pneumonia (7.1%) in the OP group and deep venous thrombosis
      (6.4%) in the YA group. Multivariable logistic regression showed that young
      adults, high-energy injury, outdoors, coma after injury, and fracture sites
      except for the proximal region were independent risk factors for associated
      injuries. Older age, male, and fracture site except for the proximal region were 
      independent risk factors for complications. CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic femoral
      fractures are mostly the result of low-energy trauma and predominantly affect the
      proximal site of the femur among older people. A higher rate of shaft fractures, 
      fractures occurring outdoors, and associated injuries were observed among young
      adults and children than among older people.

      associated with osteoclast formation and enhanced bone resorption. Specnuezhenide
      (SPN) is an active compound with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
      properties. However, the roles of SPN in diabetic osteoporosis remain unknown. In
      this study, primary bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were pretreated with SPN and
      were stimulated with receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL; 
      to induce osteoclastogenesis. The number of osteoclasts was detected by
      tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. The protein levels of
      cellular oncogene fos/nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (c-Fos/NFATc1),
      nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
      were evaluated by western blot analysis. NF-kappaB luciferase assays were used to
      examine the role of SPN in NF-kappaB activation. The DM model group received a
      high-glucose, high-fat diet and was then intraperitoneally injected with
      streptozotocin (STZ). Micro-CT scanning, serum biochemical analysis, histological
      analysis were used to assess bone loss. We found that SPN suppressed
      RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and that SPN inhibited the expression of
      osteoclast-related genes and c-Fos/NFATc1. SPN inhibited RANKL-induced activation
      of NF-kappaB and MAPKs. In vivo experiments revealed that SPN suppressed
      diabetes-induced bone loss and the number of osteoclasts. Furthermore, SPN
      decreased the levels of bone turnover markers and increased the levels of
      runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osteoprotegerin (OPG), calcium (Ca) 
      and phosphorus (P). SPN also regulated diabetes-related markers. This study
      suggests that SPN suppresses diabetes-induced bone loss by inhibiting
      RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, and provides an experimental basis for the
      treatment of diabetic osteoporosis.

TI  - Comparison of the Outcomes between AO Type B2 Thoracolumbar Fracture with and
      without Disc Injury after Posterior Surgery.
LID - 10.1111/os.13400 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The type AO B2 thoracolumbar fracture is a kind of flexion-distraction
      injury and the effect of disc injury on treatment results of patients with B2
      fracture remains unclear. The objective of the current study was to compare and
      analyze the outcomes in AO Type B2 thoracolumbar fracture patients with and
      without disc injuries in terms of the Cobb angle of kyphosis, the incidence of
      complication, and the rate of implant failure. METHODS: This is a retrospective
      study. Of the 486 patients with thoracolumbar fractures who underwent posterior
      fixation, 38 patients with AO type B2 injuries were included. All the patients
      were divided into two groups according to changes in the adjoining discs. Disc
      injury group A included 17 patients and no disc injury group included 21
      patients. Clinical and radiologic parameters were evaluated before surgery, after
      surgery, and at follow-up. Clinical outcomes included visual analogue scale (VAS)
      scores, incidence of complications, and incidence of implant failure. Radiologic 
      assessment was accomplished with the Cobb angle (CA), local kyphosis (LK),
      percentage of anterior vertebral height (AVBH%), intervertebral disc height, and 
      intervertebral disc angle. Fisher's precision probability tests were employed and
      chi square test were used to compare categorical variables. Paired sample t tests
      and independent-sample t tests were used to compare continuous data. RESULTS:
      Disc injury mainly involved the cranial disc (15/19, 78.9%). The mean follow-up
      period for the patients was 30.2 +/- 20.1 months. No neurologic deterioration was
      reported in the patients at the last follow-up. Radiological outcomes at the last
      follow-up showed significant differences in the CA (18.59 degrees +/- 13.74
      degrees vs 8.16 degrees +/- 9.99 degrees , P = 0.008), LK (12.74 degrees +/- 8.00
      degrees vs 6.55 degrees +/- 4.89 degrees , P = 0.006), and %AVBH (77.16% vs
      90.83%, P = 0.01) between the two groups.Implant failure occurred after posterior
      fixation in five patients with disc injury who did not undergo interbody fusion
      during the initial surgery. Additionally, in the subgroup analysis, interbody
      fusion in the implant failure group were significantly different than in the no
      implant failure group (0% vs 75%, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: AO B2 fracture
      patients with disc injury have higher risk of complications, especially implant
      failure after posterior surgery. Interbody fusion should be considered in AO type
      B2 fracture patients with disc injury.

TI  - Assisted reproductive technology and association with childhood cancer subtypes.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5114 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between assisted reproductive
      technology (ART) use and childhood cancer subtype. STUDY DESIGN: We deployed a
      cross-sectional survey of 1701 parents of children with cancer about their ART
      use, demographics, and gestational and perinatal factors. Multivariable logistic 
      regression modeled the association between ART use, birthweight and multiple
      gestation status with childhood cancer, by subtype. RESULTS: ART use was highest 
      among children with osteosarcoma relative to children with other cancer types,
      and this association was statistically significant in multivariable models (OR = 
      4.4; 95% CI = 1.7-11.3; p = 0.0020). ART use was also elevated among children
      with hepatoblastoma, but this relationship appeared to be due to the strong
      associations between ART use and lower birthweight in our sample. No specific ART
      modality appeared to drive these associations. In univariate models, multiple
      gestation was associated with a 2.7-fold increased odds of hepatoblastoma (OR =
      2.71; 95% CI = 1.14-6.42; p = 0.02) and a 1.6-fold increased odds of
      neuroblastoma (OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.03-2.54; p = 0.03), but these associations
      were not retained in multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between ART 
      use and hepatoblastoma risk may be attributable to birthweight, a known
      hepatoblastoma risk factor. ART use may also be associated with osteosarcoma,
      independent of birthweight, an association not previously observed in studies
      limited to cancers diagnosed before adolescence. Evaluating long-term health
      outcomes in children conceived by ART, throughout adolescence and potentially
      into adulthood, appears warranted.

TI  - Education plays a crucial role in the pathway from poverty to smoking: A
      Mendelian randomization study.
LID - 10.1111/add.16019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Disproportionately high rates of smoking have been found in 
      low-income communities, but the causal direction and role of education in this
      relationship remains less well understood. Here we used bidirectional Mendelian
      randomization (MR) to measure the causal relationships between smoking, income,
      and education. DESIGN: Two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian
      randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to evaluate the total and direct
      effect of income and education on tobacco smoking. The effects of smoking on
      education and income were explored with reverse MR analysis. SETTING: European
      ancestry. PARTICIPANTS: The most recent large-scale genome-wide association study
      (GWAS) summary data on educational attainment, household income, and smoking
      (N=143,210 ~ 766,345). MEASUREMENTS: Genetic variants for exposures including
      income, education and smoking. FINDINGS: Both income and education had protective
      effects against smoking, especially for smoking initiation (education:
      beta=-0.447, 95% confidence interval [CI] =-0.508 to -0.387, p< 0.001; income:
      beta=-0.290, 95%CI=-0.43 to -0.149, p<0.001) and cessation (education:
      beta=-0.364, 95%CI=-0.429 to -0.298, p<0.001; income: beta=-0.323, 95%CI =-0.448 
      to -0.197, p<0.001). Here, higher scores in cessation indicated a lower
      likelihood of quitting according to the coding scheme. There was little evidence 
      that income influenced smoking once education was controlled for, while education
      could significantly affect smoking behaviors independently of income
      (p=3.40x10(-10) ~0.0272). The reverse MR results suggested that smoking may
      result in a loss of years of schooling (beta=-0.190, 95%CI =-0.297 to -0.083,
      p<0.001) and reduced earnings (beta =-0.204, 95%CI =-0.347 to -0.060, p=0.006).
      CONCLUSIONS: Education appears to play an important role in the relationship
      between income and smoking. There is a bidirectional association of smoking with 
      socioeconomic status.

TI  - Comparison of the standardized Valsalva manoeuvre versus the cuff deflation
      method to elicit venous reflux.
LID - 10.1024/0301-1526/a001023 [doi]
AB  - Background: Two standardized methods to detect venous reflux, the Valsalva
      manoeuvre (VM) and the cuff deflation method (CM) are compared. Patients and
      methods: We included 72 patients with varicose veins (VV) and 106 patients with
      deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The proximal leg veins were examined. A survey was
      sent to the members of the Union of Vascular Societies to assess, which methods
      are used in the clinical practice. Results: In the VV-group the correlation
      coefficient (VM vs CM) for the reflux time (RT) amounted to 0.44 (p<0.0001) for
      the common femoral vein (CFV) and 0.4 for the femoral vein (FV) (p=0.0003). The
      sensitivity of the two tests in the VV group amounted to 87.5% for both methods
      in the CFV (p=0.4). The sensitivity for the FV amounted to 87.5% for the VM and
      71.4% for the CM (p=0.4). In the DVT - group the correlation coefficient (VM vs
      CM) for RT amounted to 0.62 for the CFV (p<0.0001) and 0.77 for the FV
      (p<0.0001), as well as to 0.6 for the great saphenous vein (GSV) (p<0.0001). The 
      sensitivity of the two tests amounted to 50.0% for the VM and 42.9% for the CM in
      the CFV (p=0.5). The sensitivity, if reflux was measured in the FV, amounted to
      42.9% for the VM and 50.0% for the CM (p=0.5). 87.3% of the doctors who answered 
      the survey use a non-standardized reflux measurement method. Conclusions: Both
      methods of reflux measurement (VM, CM) are comparable. Further studies have to
      address the issue, whether non standardized methods are as accurate as the
      standardized manoeuvres.

      therapy in the treatment of severely ill patients with mechanical ventilation.
PG  - 195-200
LID - 10.1097/MRR.0000000000000535 [doi]
AB  - To investigate the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation combined with diaphragm
      pacemaker therapy on the diaphragm function of severely ill patients on
      mechanical ventilation. Forty patients were randomly divided into the control
      group (CG; n = 20) and experimental group (EG; n = 20). The CG was given basic
      ICU nursing and conventional rehabilitation treatment. The EG added a diaphragm
      pacemaker and pulmonary rehabilitation therapies along with basic ICU nursing and
      conventional rehabilitation treatment. The relevant indexes were compared at
      baseline and postintervention, including the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Acute
      Physiology, Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, diaphragm mobility
      and thickness. The indexes of mechanical ventilation time, ICU and total hospital
      stays were compared between the two groups. There was no difference in the GCS
      and APACHE II scores, and diaphragm mobility and thickness between the two groups
      before treatment (P > 0.05). After 30 days of treatment, the GCS scores increased
      in both groups, the APACHE II scores decreased significantly, and diaphragm
      mobility and thickness decreased compared with before treatment (P < 0.05), but
      the improvement of each index in the EG was more evident than in the CG. Compared
      with the CG, the indexes of the EG, including offline, ICU and total
      hospitalization times, were significantly shorter (P < 0.05). Additionally, there
      were no adverse events such as accidental tube detachment or falling out of bed
      during treatment. Pulmonary rehabilitation combined with a diaphragm pacemaker is
      safe and effective in treating severely ill mechanically ventilated patients.

TI  - Evaluation of the hospital care quality perceived by patients with
      immune-mediated inflammatory diseases from the pharmacy service. SACVINFA study.
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.13742 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are a 
      group of chronic and highly disabling diseases. The objective is to evaluate the 
      satisfaction with the health care received by patients with the most prevalent
      IMIDs in Spain: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis (Ps) psoriatic
      arthritis (PsA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthropathies (SpAs), and 
      to determine the factors that influence patient satisfaction. METHODS: This was
      an observational, cross-sectional, multicentre study in a real-world evidence
      context conducted in the Pharmacy Service in four hospital centres of the
      Community of Madrid that belong to the National Health System. The study included
      adult patients diagnosed with an IMID who had attended the Pharmacy Service at
      least three times. The patients were grouped according to the main IMID. Health
      care satisfaction was evaluated using the chronic patient experience assessment
      (IEXPAC) questionnaire. The responses to IEXPAC are grouped into three factors:
      productive interactions, new relational model and patient self-management, with a
      total score from 0 (worst) to 10 (best experience). Health-related quality of
      life (HRQoL) was also evaluated using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, and
      pharmacological adherence was evaluated through the Morisky-Green test. RESULTS
      AND DISCUSSION: A total of 578 patients were analysed (IBD = 25.3%; Ps = 19.7%;
      SpAs = 18.7%; RA = 18.5%; PsA = 17.8%). The mean age (SD) was 49.8 (12.3) years
      and 50.7% were male. The average score (SD) for the total IEXPAC sample was 6.6
      (1.9). RA was the IMID with the lowest score, at 5.83 (2.0), significantly lower 
      than the scores of Ps (SD) [7.01 (1.7); p = 0.003], IBD [6.83 (1, 9); p = 0.012] 
      and SpAs [6.80 (1.6); p = 0.001]. Productive interactions (SD) [8.5 (1.8)] and
      patient self-management (SD) [7.3 (2.3)] were the factors with the highest
      scores, and the new relational model had the lowest score (SD) [3.2 (2.7)]. Male 
      gender, a longer time interval between medication administrations and a higher
      HRQoL were correlated with better patient satisfaction. Current biological
      therapy (according to the Anatomical Chemical classification system) also had a
      significant influence; patients treated with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors
      and interleukin inhibitors showed greater satisfaction than those treated with
      selective immunosuppressants. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The IEXPAC results show
      high general satisfaction with care quality reported by patients with IMIDs
      treated in the Pharmacy Service. However, there are areas of improvement in care 
      quality specially health professional-patient communication, such as increasing
      access to information, and promoting and facilitating relationships with patients
      in similar conditions.

TI  - Effect of Macrotroponin in a Cohort of Community Patients with Elevated Cardiac
      Troponin.
LID - hvac118 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/clinchem/hvac118 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Macrotroponin is an important cause of discrepancy between current
      high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays, however, its clinical
      significance is unclear. This study examined the effects of macrotroponin and
      repeat testing by different hs-cTnI assays in a cohort of community patients with
      elevated hs-cTnI. METHODS: The first residual serum specimen from each patient in
      the community admitted to hospital with elevated hs-cTnI (Siemens hs-cTnI
      Centaur) was retested after immunoglobulin depletion and by 5 other hs-cTn
      assays. Low recovery of cTnI (<40%) following immunoglobulin depletion was
      considered as macrotroponin. A retrospective chart review was performed for these
      participants. Investigator-adjudicated diagnosis served as the reference
      standard. RESULTS: In our cohort of community patients with elevated troponin (n 
      = 188), participants with macrotroponin (n = 99) often had a multifactorial or
      indeterminate myocardial injury (56% vs 25%) and were less likely to have acute
      coronary syndrome (9% vs 28%). On repeat testing of cTn on other platforms,
      better diagnostic performance (c-statistics) for ischemic and non-ischemic
      cardiac causes was observed on the Beckman Access hs-cTnI (0.74; 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 0.67-0.81) or the Abbott hs-cTnI Architect (0.75; CI 0.68-0.82)
      compared to the Siemens hs-cTnI Vista (0.62; CI 0.54-0.70; P < 0.05). This could 
      be attributed to differences in assay reactivity for macrotroponin.
      Interestingly, better diagnostic performance was observed in patients without
      macrotroponin. Although a small number of deaths occurred (n = 16), participants 
      with macrotroponin had better overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: In the low-risk
      setting, the presence of macrotroponin was clinically associated with
      multifactorial or indeterminate causes of troponin elevation.

TI  - Comparison of six surrogate insulin resistance indexes for predicting the risk of
      incident stroke: The Rural Chinese Cohort Study.
PG  - e3567
LID - 10.1002/dmrr.3567 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: and Purpose: Some cheap and easily-used operated indexes of insulin
      resistance (IR) were currently available. We aimed to evaluate the association of
      six surrogate indexes of IR with incident stroke and to compare their predictive 
      capacity. METHODS: We analyzed data from 14,595 eligible study participants from 
      the Rural Chinese Cohort Study. Modified Poisson regression models were used to
      estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of incident 
      stroke associated with the visceral adiposity index (VAI), the Chinese visceral
      adiposity index (CVAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), triglyceride-glucose
      (TyG), TyG-body mass index (TyG-BMI), and TyG-waist circumference (TyG-WC). The
      receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) was used to compare the ability of
      the abovementioned IR indexes to predict stroke. RESULTS: During a median
      follow-up of 6 years, 786 newly-diagnosed stroke cases were identified. The
      levels of six surrogate indexes of IR were all significantly higher in the stroke
      population than in the non-stroke population (p<0.001). Compared with quartile 1,
      the multivariable adjusted RRs (95% CIs) of incident stroke for quartile 4 were
      2.01 (1.47-2.76), 1.62 (1.28, 2.04), 1.64 (1.28-2.09), and 1.92 (1.50-2.45) for
      CVAI, VAI, LAP, and TyG, respectively. Significant dose-response associations
      were also found between surrogate IR indexes and risk of stroke. The area under
      the curves (AUCs) for CVAI (0.674) was significantly greater than for other
      indexes (TyG-WC:0.622, TyG:0.614, LAP:0.606, TyG-BMI:0.598, and VAI:0.577)
      (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Six surrogate indexes of IR were independently associated
      with incident stroke. The CVAI may be the most suitable index for stroke
      prediction. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Raman spectroscopy for the differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae: a comparison of
      two methods.
LID - 10.1039/d2an00822j [doi]
AB  - Enterobacteriaceae are the leading cause of urinary tract infections, and include
      pathogens such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis. Due to their
      similarity, the correct identification of these pathogens is difficult and
      time-consuming. Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated extensively as a tool
      for rapid microbiological differentiation. However, for pathogenic
      Enterobacteriaceae the application of Raman spectroscopy has been particularly
      challenging. In this study, two promising methods for Raman-based microbiological
      diagnostics were compared for differentiating Enterobacteriaceae. Spectra were
      collected from single-cells with Raman microspectroscopy and from colonies on
      agar with an NIR Raman fiber-probe. A comprehensive dataset of spectra from 8
      different, clinically relevant, genera was collected. Visually, the spectra
      obtained from both methods presented little difference between the genera. For
      classification, single cell analysis yielded limited results, while the
      fiber-probe spectra enabled perfect classification of all 16 isolates. Moreover, 
      the model was validated on new replicates and 15/16 strains were correctly
      identified (94% overall accuracy). This is the first study to focus on the
      closely related Enterobacteriaceae, who have previously been avoided or
      differentiated poorly. It shows how, with the correct spectroscopic setup, even
      challenging questions in clinical microbiology can be resolved with Raman
      spectroscopy, highlighting the method's potential for improving patient care.

TI  - Association between Abnormal Serum Lipid Levels in Early Pregnancy and
      Development of Preeclampsia.
PG  - 761-768
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate early biomarkers of oxidative stress, placenta perfusion and
      vascular resistance and endothelial platelet interaction for prediction of
      preeclampsia have not been shown to be beneficial for routine clinical use. The
      study of association between abnormal lipid levels in early pregnancy and
      preeclampsia is thus necessary in a bid to reduce the progression and severity of
      complications of preeclampsia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between
      abnormal lipid levels in early pregnancy and the development of preeclampsia.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study involving 184 pregnant
      women with singleton pregnancy who met the inclusion criteria and recruited from 
      the antenatal clinic at gestational age of < 20weeks. Their fasting blood samples
      were collected for the measurement serum lipid profile. They were monitored until
      delivery for the development of preeclampsia. The mean values of serum lipid
      profile were analyzed for association with pre-eclampsia using the statistical
      package for social sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 and P value of < 0.05 was
      considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Out of 184 participants, 3 had
      spontaneous miscarriage and were excluded while 5 were lost to follow up. This
      left a total of 176 participants who completed the study, 11 of which developed
      preeclampsia. There was a statistically significant increase in the levels of
      total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the preeclamptic
      group. The mean serum lipid levels were 4.8 mmol/L for total cholesterol, 1.87
      mmol/L for total triglycerides, 1.3 mmol/L for high-density lipoprotein and 2.67 
      mmol/L for low-density lipoprotein. Age and parity also showed a causal
      association with development of preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: There was an
      association between elevated serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein 
      with development of preeclampsia later in pregnancy.

TI  - DR-FLASH Score Is Useful for Identifying Patients With Persistent Atrial
      Fibrillation Who Require Extensive Catheter Ablation Procedures.
PG  - e024916
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024916 [doi]
AB  - Background Modification of arrhythmogenic substrates with extensive ablation
      comprising linear and/or complex fractional atrial electrogram ablation in
      addition to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI-plus) can theoretically reduce the
      recurrence of atrial fibrillation. The DR-FLASH score (score based on diabetes
      mellitus, renal dysfunction, persistent form of atrial fibrillation, left
      atrialdiameter >45 mm, age >65 years, female sex, and hypertension) is reportedly
      useful for identifying patients with arrhythmogenic substrates. We hypothesized
      that, in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, the DR-FLASH score can be 
      used to classify patients into those who require PVI-plus and those for whom a
      PVI-only strategy is sufficient. Methods and Results This study is a post hoc
      subanalysis of the a multicenter, randomized controlled, noninferiority trial
      investigating efficacy and safety of pulmonary vein isolation alone for
      recurrence prevention compared with extensive ablation in patients with
      persistent atrial fibrillation (EARNEST-PVI trial). This analysis focuses on the 
      relationship between DR-FLASH score and the efficacy of different ablation
      strategies. We divided the population into 2 groups based on a DR-FLASH score of 
      3 points. A total of 469 patients were analyzed. Among those with a DR-FLASH
      score >3 (N=279), the event rate of atrial arrhythmia recurrence was
      significantly lower in the PVI-plus arm than in the PVI-only arm (hazard ratio
      [HR], 0.45 [95% CI, 0.28-0.72]; P<0.001). In contrast, among patients with a
      DR-FLASH score </=3 (N=217), no differences were observed in the event rate of
      atrial arrhythmia recurrence between the PVI-only arm and the PVI-plus arm (HR,
      1.08 [95% CI, 0.61-1.89]; P=0.795). There was significant interaction between
      patients with a DR-FLASH score >3 and DR-FLASH score </=3 (P value for
      interaction=0.020). Conclusions The DR-FLASH score is a useful tool for deciding 
      the catheter ablation strategy for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.

TI  - Effect of Canagliflozin on Total Cardiovascular Burden in Patients With Diabetes 
      and Chronic Kidney Disease: A Post Hoc Analysis From the CREDENCE Trial.
PG  - e025045
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.025045 [doi]
AB  - Background The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin reduced the
      risk of first cardiovascular composite events in the CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and 
      Renal Events in Diabetes With Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial.
      In this post hoc analysis, we evaluated the effect of canagliflozin on total
      (first and recurrent) cardiovascular events. Methods and Results The CREDENCE
      trial compared canagliflozin or matching placebo in 4401 patients with type 2
      diabetes, albuminuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 to <90
      mL/min per 1.73 m(2), over a median of 2.6 years. The primary outcome was
      analyzed as a composite of any cardiovascular event including myocardial
      infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, hospitalization for
      unstable angina, and cardiovascular death. Negative binomial regression models
      were used to assess the effect of canagliflozin on the net burden of
      cardiovascular events. During the trial, 634 patients had 883 cardiovascular
      events, of whom 472 (74%) had just 1 cardiovascular event and 162 (26%) had
      multiple cardiovascular events. Canagliflozin reduced first cardiovascular events
      by 26% (hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.63-0.86]; P<0.001) and total cardiovascular
      events by 29% (incidence rate ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59-0.86]; P<0.001). The
      absolute risk difference per 1000 patients treated over 2.5 years was -44 (95%
      CI, -67 to -21) first cardiovascular events and -73 (95% CI, -114 to -33) total
      events. Conclusions Canagliflozin reduced cardiovascular events, with a larger
      absolute benefit for total cardiovascular than first cardiovascular events. These
      findings provide further support for the benefit of continuing canagliflozin
      therapy after an initial event to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events.

TI  - Feasibility of Blood Pressure Measurement With a Wearable (Watch-Type) Monitor
      During Impending Syncopal Episodes.
PG  - e026420
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.122.026420 [doi]
AB  - Background We assessed the reliability and feasibility of blood pressure (BP)
      measurements by means of a new wearable watch-type BP monitor (HeartGuide) in
      detecting episodes of hypotensive (pre)syncope induced by tilt table test.
      Methods and Results An intrapatient comparison between systolic BP (SBP) measured
      by means of the HeartGuide device and noninvasive finger beat-to-beat BP
      monitoring was undertaken both at baseline in supine position and repeatedly
      during tilt table test in patients evaluated for reflex syncope. Intrapatient
      fall of systolic BP from baseline was measured. Eighty-one patients (mean age,
      61+/-19 years; 46 women) were included. Overall, HeartGuide was able to yield BP 
      values at the time of BP nadir in 58 (72%) patients (average HeartGuide SBP
      102+/-18 mm Hg, versus finger SBP 101+/-19 mm Hg). Compared with baseline, the
      maximum SBP decrease was on average -28.5+/-27.8 and -30.3+/-33.9 mm Hg
      respectively (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient=0.78, r=0.79, P=0.001).
      In the subgroup of 38 patients with tilt table test induced (pre)syncope, the
      average HeartGuide SBP during symptoms was 97+/-16 mm Hg, and the finger SBP was 
      94+/-18 mm Hg. Compared with baseline, the maximum SBP decrease was on average
      -35.2+/-29.3 and -43.3+/-31.8 mm Hg, respectively (Lin's concordance correlation 
      coefficient=0.83, r=0.87, P=0.001). Conclusions Our data indicate that the
      HeartGuide BP monitor can detect low BP during presyncope and that its measure of
      SBP change is consistent with that simultaneously obtained through continuous BP 
      monitoring, despite some intrapatient variability. Thus, this device might be
      useful in determining the hypotensive nature of spontaneous (pre)syncopal
      symptoms, a possibility that should be verified by field studies.

      A Population-Based Analysis.
PG  - e024574
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024574 [doi]
AB  - Background Data on percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) outcomes in 
      the very elderly with atrial fibrillation are limited. We aimed to investigate
      the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of patients 80 years or
      older following percutaneous LAAC in a large nationwide database. Methods and
      Results Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database, we identified patients who
      underwent percutaneous LAAC between January 2016 and December 2018. Patients were
      categorized based on age (>/=80 and <80 years old). The primary outcome was
      in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital end points including
      periprocedural complications, 30-day outcomes, and all-cause 30-day readmissions.
      A propensity score-matched model (1:1) was used to adjust for baseline
      characteristics among the study groups. A total of 13 208 patients were included 
      in this study (43% women, median age in years [interquartile range] 79.5 [73-84])
      and matched one-to-one (6604 and 6604 patients were >/=80 and <80 years old,
      respectively). In-hospital mortality was not statistically different between the 
      study groups and occurred in 21 patients >/=80 years old (0.32%) and in 14
      patients <80 years old (0.21%); P=0.236. Rates of in-hospital stroke/transient
      ischemic attack were higher in patients >/=80 years old compared with those <80
      years old (1.22% versus 0.77%; P=0.009). In-hospital bleeding requiring
      transfusion, vascular complications, systemic embolization, and pericardial
      effusion/tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis or surgical intervention occurred
      more frequently in patients >/=80 years old. Furthermore, the elderly group was
      more likely to be readmitted within 30 days compared with those <80 years old
      (9.91% versus 8.4%; P=0.004); however, rates of 30-day complications were not
      statistically different between the study groups. Conclusions In a large
      nationwide database, patients >/=80 years old undergoing percutaneous LAAC were
      found to have similar in-hospital mortality but an increased risk of
      periprocedural complications and 30-day readmission compared with younger
      patients. Our data suggest that LAAC should be considered on a case-by-case basis
      in the very elderly, taking into consideration the risks and benefits of this
      intervention. Further studies are needed to assess long-term LAAC outcomes in
      this high-risk population.

TI  - Trends, Predictors, and Outcomes of 30-Day Readmission With Heart Failure After
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Insights From the US Nationwide
      Readmission Database.
PG  - e024890
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Data on trends, predictors, and outcomes of heart failure (HF)
      readmissions after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remain limited. 
      Moreover, the relationship between hospital TAVR discharge volume and HF
      readmission outcomes has not been established. METHODS AND RESULTS The Nationwide
      Readmission Database was used to identify 30-day readmissions for HF after TAVR
      from October 1, 2015, to November 30, 2018, using International Classification of
      Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes. A total of 167
      345 weighted discharges following TAVR were identified. The all-cause readmission
      rate within 30 days of discharge was 11.4% (19 016). Of all the causes of 30-day 
      rehospitalizations, HF comprised 31.4% (5962) of all causes. The 30-day
      readmission rate for HF did not show a significant decline during the study
      period (Ptrend=0.06); however, all-cause readmission rates decreased
      significantly (Ptrend=0.03). HF readmissions were comparable between high- and
      low-volume TAVR centers. Charlson Comorbidity Index >8, length of stay >4 days
      during the index hospitalization, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial
      fibrillation, chronic HF, preexisting pacemaker, complete heart block during
      index hospitalization, paravalvular regurgitation, chronic kidney disease, and
      end-stage renal disease were independent predictors of 30-day HF readmission
      after TAVR. HF readmissions were associated with higher mortality rates when
      compared with non-HF readmissions (4.9% versus 3.3%; P<0.01). Each HF readmission
      within 30 days was associated with an average increased cost of $13 000 more than
      for each non-HF readmission. CONCLUSIONS During the study period from 2015 to
      2018, 30-day HF readmissions after TAVR remained steady despite all-cause
      readmissions decreasing significantly. All-cause readmission mortality and HF
      readmission mortality also showed a nonsignificant downtrend. HF readmissions
      were comparable across low-, medium-, and high-volume TAVR centers. HF
      readmission was associated with increased mortality and resource use attributed
      to the increased costs of care compared with non-HF readmission. Further studies 
      are needed to identify strategies to decrease the burden of HF readmissions and
      related mortality after TAVR.

TI  - Prevalence of Mitral Annulus Disjunction and Mitral Valve Prolapse in Patients
      With Idiopathic Ventricular Fibrillation.
PG  - e025364
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.025364 [doi]
AB  - Background Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) is diagnosed in patients
      with ventricular fibrillation of which the origin is not identified after
      extensive evaluations. Recent studies suggest an association between mitral
      annulus disjunction (MAD), mitral valve prolapse (MVP), and ventricular
      arrhythmias. The prevalence of MAD and MVP in patients with IVF in this regard is
      not well established. We aimed to explore the prevalence of MAD and MVP in a
      consecutive cohort of patients with IVF compared with matched controls. Methods
      and Results In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, cardiac magnetic
      resonance images from patients with IVF (ie, negative for ischemia,
      cardiomyopathy, and channelopathies) and age- and sex-matched control subjects
      were analyzed for the presence of MAD (>/=2 mm) and MVP (>2 mm). In total, 72
      patients (mean age 39+/-14 years, 42% women) and 72 control subjects (mean age
      41+/-11 years, 42% women) were included. MAD in the inferolateral wall was more
      prevalent in patients with IVF versus healthy controls (7 [11%] versus 1 [1%],
      P=0.024). MVP was only seen in patients with IVF and not in controls (5 [7%]
      versus 0 [0%], P=0.016). MAD was observed in both patients with (n=4) and without
      (n=3) MVP. Conclusions Inferolateral MAD and MVP were significantly more
      prevalent in patients with IVF compared with healthy controls. The authors
      advocate that evaluation of the mitral valve region deserves extra attention in
      the extensive screening of patients with unexplained cardiac arrest. These
      findings support further exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms
      underlying a subset of IVF that associates with MAD and MVP.

TI  - Characterization of Polyvascular Disease in Heterozygous Familial
      Hypercholesterolemia: Its Association With Circulating Lipoprotein(a) Levels.
PG  - e025232
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.025232 [doi]
AB  - Background Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) more likely exhibits
      extensive atherosclerotic disease at multiple vascular beds. Lipoprotein(a)
      (Lp(a)) is an atherogenic lipoprotein that elevates HeFH-related atherosclerotic 
      cardiovascular disease risks. Whether circulating Lp(a) level associates with
      polyvascular propagation of atherosclerosis in subjects with HeFH remains
      uncertain. Methods and Results The current study analyzed 370 subjects with
      clinically diagnosed HeFH who received evaluation of systemic arteries.
      Polyvascular disease (polyVD) was defined as more than 2 coexisting
      atherosclerosis conditions including coronary artery disease, carotid stenosis,
      or peripheral artery disease. Clinical characteristics and lipid features were
      analyzed in subjects with HeFH and polyVD; 5.7% of patients with HeFH (21/370)
      had polyVD. They were more likely to have a clustering of risk factors, tendon
      (P<0.001) and skin xanthomas (P=0.004), and corneal arcus (P=0.026). Furthermore,
      an elevated Lp(a) level (P=0.006) and a greater frequency of Lp(a) level >/=50
      mg/dL (P<0.001) were observed in subjects with HeFH and polyVD. On multivariable 
      analysis adjusting risk factors and lipid-lowering agents, Lp(a) >/=50 mg/dL
      (odds ratio [OR], 5.66 [95% CI, 1.68-19.0], P=0.005), age, and family history of 
      premature coronary artery disease independently predicted polyVD in subjects with
      HeFH. Of note, the prevalence of polyVD rose to 33.3% in patients with HeFH and
      age >58 years old, family history of premature coronary artery disease, and Lp(a)
      >/=50 mg/dL (OR, 10.3 [95% CI, 3.12-33.4], P<0.001). Conclusions An increased
      level of circulating Lp(a) levels predicted concomitance of polyVD in patients
      with HeFH. The current findings suggest subjects with HeFH and Lp(a) >/=50 mg/dL 
      as a high-risk category who require meticulous screening of systemic vascular
      beds.

TI  - Functional Echocardiographic and Serum Biomarker Changes Following Surgical and
      Percutaneous Atrial Septal Defect Closure in Children.

AB  - Background Ventricular performance is temporarily reduced following surgical
      atrial septal defect closure. Cardiopulmonary bypass and changes in loading
      conditions are considered important factors, but this phenomenon is incompletely 
      understood. We aim to characterize biventricular performance following surgical
      and percutaneous atrial septal defect closure and to relate biomarkers to
      ventricular performance following intervention. Methods and Results In this
      multicenter prospective study, children scheduled for surgical or percutaneous
      atrial septal defect closure were included. Subjects were assessed
      preoperatively, in the second week postintervention (at 2-weeks follow-up), and
      1-year postintervention (1-year follow-up). At each time point, an
      echocardiographic study and a panel of biomarkers were obtained. Sixty-three
      patients (median age, 4.1 [interquartile range, 3.1-6.1] years) were included.
      Forty-three patients underwent surgery. At 2-weeks follow-up, right ventricular
      global longitudinal strain was decreased for the surgical, but not the
      percutaneous, group (-17.6+/-4.1 versus -27.1+/-3.4; P<0.001). A smaller decrease
      was noted for left ventricular global longitudinal strain at 2-weeks follow-up
      for the surgical group (surgical versus percutaneous, -18.6+/-3.2 versus
      -20.2+/-2.4; P=0.040). At 1-year follow-up, left ventricular performance returned
      to baseline, whereas right ventricular performance improved, but did not reach
      preintervention levels. Eight biomarkers relating to cardiovascular and
      immunological processes differed across study time points. Of these biomarkers,
      only NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) correlated with less
      favorable left ventricular global longitudinal strain at 2-weeks follow-up.
      Conclusions Right, and to a lesser degree left, ventricular performance was
      reduced early after surgical atrial septal defect closure. Right ventricular
      performance at 1-year follow-up remained below baseline levels. Several
      biomarkers showed a pattern over time similar to ventricular performance. These
      biomarkers may provide insight into the processes that affect ventricular
      function. Registration URL: https://www.trialregister.nl/; Unique identifier:

TI  - Impact of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 rs956115 and CYP2C19 rs4244285 Genotypes
      on Clinical Outcome of Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.
PG  - e025058
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.025058 [doi]
AB  - Background Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) rs956115 is associated with
      vascular risk in patients with coronary artery disease and concomitant diabetes. 
      CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285) modulates clopidogrel response and predicts the outcome of 
      coronary artery disease. This study was designed to explore the association
      between IRS-1, CYP2C19*2 genotypes, platelet reactivity, and 1-year outcome in
      patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention. Methods and Results Genotyping was performed using an improved
      multiplex ligation detection reaction technique. Platelet aggregation was
      assessed by light transmission aggregometry. Major adverse cardiovascular events 
      were defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and
      ischemic stroke. A total of 2213 consecutive patients were screened and 1614 were
      recruited. At 1 month, patients with IRS-1 CG genotype had significantly lower
      levels of ADP-induced platelet aggregation compared with patients with CC
      homozygotes. Patients with IRS-1 CG or GG genotype had a 2.09-fold higher risk of
      major adverse cardiovascular events compared with those with CC homozygotes (95% 
      CI, 1.04-4.19; P=0.0376). By comparison, patients with CYP2C19*2 GA or AA
      genotype had higher ADP-induced platelet aggregation compared with patients with 
      GG homozygotes. Although there was no significant difference in risk of major
      adverse cardiovascular events between patients with GA/AA and GG genotypes,
      patients with GA genotype had a 2.19-fold higher risk than those with GG
      homozygotes (95% CI, 1.13-4.24; P=0.0200). No interaction between IRS-1 and
      CYP2C19*2 genotypes was observed. Conclusions In patients following percutaneous 
      coronary intervention, IRS-1 GG/CG and CYP2C19*2 GA genotypes were associated
      with 2.09- and 2.19-fold increased cardiovascular risk, respectively, at 1-year
      follow-up. The association between IRS-1 genotypes and major adverse
      cardiovascular events appeared to be independent of known clinical predictors.

PG  - e025644
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.122.025644 [doi]
AB  - Background We investigated the causal associations between the genetic liability 
      to cardiovascular and lifestyle risk factors and peripheral artery disease (PAD),
      using a Mendelian randomization approach. Methods and Results We performed a
      2-sample inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization analysis, multiple
      sensitivity analyses to assess pleiotropy and multivariate Mendelian
      randomization analyses to assess mediating/confounding factors. European-ancestry
      genomic summary data (P<5x10(-8)) for type 2 diabetes, lipid-fractions, smoking, 
      alcohol and coffee consumption, physical activity, sleep, and education level
      were selected. Genetic associations with PAD were extracted from the
      Million-Veteran-Program genome-wide association studies (cases=31 307,
      controls=211 753, 72% European-ancestry) and the GoLEAD-SUMMIT genome-wide
      association studies (11 independent genome-wide association studies,
      European-ancestry, cases=12 086, controls=449 548). Associations were categorized
      as robust (Bonferroni-significant (P<0.00294), consistent over
      PAD-cohorts/sensitivity analyses), suggestive (P value: 0.00294-0.05,
      associations in 1 PAD-cohort/inconsistent sensitivity analyses) or not present.
      Robust evidence for genetic liability to type 2 diabetes, smoking, insomnia, and 
      inverse associations for higher education level with PAD were found. Suggestive
      evidence for the genetic liability to higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
      triglyceride-levels, alcohol consumption, and inverse associations for
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased sleep duration were found. No
      associations were found for physical activity and coffee consumption. However,
      effects fully attenuated for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
      triglycerides after correcting for apoB, and for insomnia after correcting for
      body mass index and lipid-fractions. Nonsignificant attenuation by potential
      mediators was observed for education level and type 2 diabetes. Conclusions
      Detrimental effects of smoking and type 2 diabetes, but not of low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, on PAD were confirmed. Lower education
      level and insomnia were identified as novel risk factors for PAD; however,
      complete mediation for insomnia and incomplete mediation for education level by
      downstream risk factors was observed.

AB  - Primordial germ cells transplantation is a unique approach for conservation and
      reconstitution of endangered fish species. This study aimed to establish
      techniques to culture dechorionated embryos in different incubation systems and
      also to determine anaesthetic concentration for fish recipients in the larval
      stage for subsequent primordial germ cell transplantation. Intact and
      dechorionated embryos were divided into three incubation systems: (1) a control
      group with manual replacement of the solution; (2) a closed environment with high
      oxygen with manual replacement of the solution; and (3) constant solution
      recirculation. This combination resulted in six treatments. For the evaluation of
      anaesthetics for larvae, the concentrations evaluated were 19.5 mM, 24.4 mM, 29.3
      mM, and 34.2 mM of 2-phenoxyethanol. Anaesthesia concentration and recovery at
      different stages were evaluated. For transplantation, primordial germ cells of
      Astyanax altiparanae were transplanted into anaesthetised larvae (1 dph) of
      Prochilodus lineatus. Better results were obtained in the recirculation system
      for dechorionated embryos of P. lineatus for hatching (54.18%) and normal
      morphology (50.06%). The 2-phenoxyethanol anaesthetic with a dose of 29.3 mM
      resulted in shorter induction times, in addition to the recovery time between 5
      and 10 min. By using this anaesthetic concentration at transplantation,
      GFP-positive cells were seen in two recipients, but the cells did not
      proliferate. This study established an effective incubation system for the
      development of the dechorionated embryo and determined an effective anaesthetic
      concentration for P. lineatus larvae. In addition, micromanipulation and
      transplantation of primordial germ cells in neotropical species were conducted
      for the first time.

TI  - von Willebrand Factor: A Central Regulator of Arteriovenous Fistula Maturation
      Through Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation and Outward Remodeling.
PG  - e024581
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024581 [doi]
AB  - Background Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation failure is a main limitation of
      vascular access. Maturation is determined by the intricate balance between
      outward remodeling and intimal hyperplasia, whereby endothelial cell dysfunction,
      platelet aggregation, and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation play a
      crucial role. von Willebrand Factor (vWF) is an endothelial cell-derived protein 
      involved in platelet aggregation and VSMC proliferation. We investigated AVF
      vascular remodeling in vWF-deficient mice and vWF expression in failed and
      matured human AVFs. Methods and Results Jugular-carotid AVFs were created in
      wild-type and vWF(-/-) mice. AVF flow was determined longitudinally using
      ultrasonography, whereupon AVFs were harvested 14 days after surgery. VSMCs were 
      isolated from vena cavae to study the effect of vWF on VSMC proliferation.
      Patient-matched samples of the basilic vein were obtained before brachio-basilic 
      AVF construction and during superficialization or salvage procedure 6 weeks after
      AVF creation. vWF deficiency reduced VSMC proliferation and macrophage
      infiltration in the intimal hyperplasia. vWF(-/-) mice showed reduced outward
      remodeling (1.5-fold, P=0.002) and intimal hyperplasia (10.2-fold, P<0.0001). AVF
      flow in wild-type mice was incremental over 2 weeks, whereas flow in vWF(-/-)
      mice did not increase, resulting in a two-fold lower flow at 14 days compared
      with wild-type mice (P=0.016). Outward remodeling in matured patient AVFs
      coincided with increased local vWF expression in the media of the venous outflow 
      tract. Absence of vWF in the intimal layer correlated with an increase in the
      intima-media ratio. Conclusions vWF enhances AVF maturation because its positive 
      effect on outward remodeling outweighs its stimulating effect on intimal
      hyperplasia.

TI  - Impact of Device Miniaturization on Insertable Cardiac Monitor Use in the
      Pediatric Population: An Analysis of the MarketScan Commercial and Medicaid
      Databases.
PG  - e024112
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.121.024112 [doi]
AB  - Background Insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) are effective in the detection of
      paroxysmal arrhythmias. In 2014, the first miniaturized ICM was introduced with a
      less invasive implant technique. The impact of this technology on ICM use in
      pediatric patients has not been evaluated. We hypothesized an increase in annual 
      pediatric ICM implants starting in 2014 attributable to device miniaturization.
      Methods and Results A retrospective observational study was conducted using
      administrative claims from MarketScan Medicaid and commercial insurance claims
      databases. Use of ICM between January 2013 and December 2018 was measured
      (normalized to the total enrolled population </=18 years) and compared with
      balancing measures (Holter ambulatory monitors, cardiac event monitors,
      encounters with syncope diagnosis, implantation of implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator/pacemaker). Secondary analyses included evaluations of
      subsequent interventions and complications. The study cohort included 33 532 185 
      individual subjects, of which 769 (0.002%) underwent ICM implantation. Subjects
      who underwent ICM implantation were 52% male sex, with a median age of 16 years
      (interquartile range, 10-17 years). A history of syncope was present in 71%,
      palpitations in 43%, and congenital heart disease in 28%. Following release of
      the miniaturized ICM, use of ICMs increased from 5 procedures per million
      enrollees in 2013 to 11 per million between 2015 and 2018 (P<0.001), while
      balancing measures remained static. Of 394 subjects with >/=1 year of follow-up
      after implantation, interventions included catheter ablation in 24 (6%),
      pacemaker implantation in 15 (4%), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
      implantation in 7 (2%). Conclusions Introduction of the miniaturized ICM was
      followed by a rapid increase in pediatric use. The effects on outcomes and value 
      deserve further attention.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Symptom Cluster is Associated With Epigenetic Regulation of
      Lymphotoxin Beta in Oncology Patients Receiving Chemotherapy.
PG  - 10998004221115863
LID - 10.1177/10998004221115863 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: While the gastrointestinal symptom cluster (GISC) is common in
      patients receiving chemotherapy, limited information is available on its
      underlying mechanism(s). Emerging evidence suggests a role for inflammatory
      processes through the actions of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling
      pathway. This study evaluated for associations between a GISC and levels of DNA
      methylation for genes within this pathway. METHODS: Prior to their second or
      third cycle of chemotherapy, 1071 outpatients reported symptom occurrence using
      the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. A GISC was identified using exploratory
      factor analysis. Differential methylation analyses were performed in two
      independent samples using EPIC (n = 925) and 450K (n = 146) microarrays. Trans
      expression-associated CpG (eCpG) loci for 56 NF-kappaB signaling pathway genes
      were evaluated. Loci significance were assessed using an exploratory false
      discovery rate (FDR) of 25% for the EPIC sample. For the validation assessment
      using the 450K sample, significance was assessed at an unadjusted p-value of
      0.05. RESULTS: For the EPIC sample, the GISC was associated with increased
      expression of lymphotoxin beta (LTB) at one differentially methylated trans eCpG 
      locus (cg03171795; FDR = 0.168). This association was not validated in the 450K
      sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to identify an association between a
      GISC and epigenetic regulation of a gene that is involved in the initiation of
      gastrointestinal immune responses. Findings suggest that increased LTB expression
      by hypermethylation of a trans eCpG locus is involved in the occurrence of this
      cluster in patients receiving chemotherapy. LTB may be a potential therapeutic
      target for this common cluster.

TI  - Quality grade evaluation and related antioxidant activity research of different
      medicinal parts of Catalpa fruit.
LID - 10.1039/d2ay00919f [doi]
AB  - Catalpa fruit is a traditional Chinese medicine used in the treatment of diuresis
      and detumescence; however one-sided quantitative or qualitative investigation
      limits its overall quality evaluation. Hence, this study proposed to
      qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the quality consistency of Catalpa
      fruit from the perspectives of chromatography and spectroscopy. First, the fusion
      fingerprints of 15 batches of Catalpa fruit pericarp and 15 batches of Catalpa
      fruit seed were established by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 
      ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy in equal weights, respectively, to avoid the
      unilaterality of a single analytical technique. The different medicinal parts of 
      Catalpa fruit were graded and evaluated based on a systematically quantified
      fingerprint method, and the quality of the pericarp and seed was further
      investigated. The results revealed that the quality of most pericarp and seed
      samples was within the acceptable level range (grade </= 5), and that seed
      quality was clearly superior to pericarp quality. Furthermore, according to the
      research findings, the content of p-hydroxybenzoic acid in Catalpa fruit pericarp
      was generally higher than that in Catalpa fruit seed, while the content of
      catalposide was generally lower than that in Catalpa fruit seed. Additionally,
      the fingerprint-efficacy relationship with HPLC was discussed by binary
      correlation analysis, which indicated that catalposide had the strongest
      antioxidant activity. This study demonstrated that the analytical techniques
      based on chromatographic fingerprinting, spectral fingerprinting and antioxidant 
      activity provided new theoretical foundation as well as technical guidance for
      Catalpa fruit quality control and rational utilization.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate spinal 
      rotation measurement by scoliometer or EOS Imagings with reference to that by CT 
      images, and to clarify their applicability in clinical practice. METHODS:
      Patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who were indicated for
      surgery were enrolled and the informed consents were obtained. The angle of trunk
      rotation (ATR) was measured by the scoliometer. Apical vertebral rotation (AVR)
      was measured with EOS Imaging and CT images. Paired T tests were used to compare 
      the measurements between ATR or AVR-EOS and AVR-CT. Pearson correlation analysis 
      was performed to explore the relationship between ATR or AVR-EOS and AVR-CT. Then
      subgroup analysis was performed. RESULTS: Forty-seven consecutive AIS patients
      with 62 curves were identified. In the whole group, the ATR, as well as AVR-EOS, 
      was significantly smaller than the AVR-CT. Both ATR and AVR-EOS correlated with
      AVR-CT, although AVR-EOS correlated better. In thoracic group, there was no
      significant difference between ATR and AVR-CT (P = .236). A significant
      correlation was found between ATR and AVR-CT(r = .574, P < .001). In TL/L group, 
      no significant difference was noted between AVR-EOS and AVR-CT (P = .414), and a 
      significant correlation was found between AVR-EOS and AVR-CT(r = .824, P < .001).
      CONCLUSION: ATR by scoliometer is numerically similar to AVR by CT and may
      evaluate the spinal rotation more appropriately in thoracic spine. AVR by EOS is 
      numerically similar to AVR by CT and may be more applicable in TL/L spine.
      Appropriate methods could be selected according to the location of the curve.

      improvements were observed according to NDI and VAS (P < .0001 (arm); P < .001
      (neck); P = .002 (head)) at all time points. Analgetic use could be reduced in
      87.1 to 95.2%. Doctor`s visits have been reduced in 93.8% after 24 months.
      Patient`s overall satisfaction was high with 78.4 to 83.5% of patients. The
      composite success rate was 77.5% after 12 months and 76.9% after 24 months. There
      were no major complications in this series. Slight subsidence of the prosthesis
      was observed in 2 patients and 3 patients demonstrated fusion after 24 months. 2 
      patients developed symptomatic foraminal stenosis, so that implant removal and
      fusion was performed resulting in a revision rate of 1.7% in 2 years. CONCLUSION:
      The ROTAIO(R) cervical disc prosthesis is a safe and efficient treatment option
      for symptomatic degenerative disc disease demonstrating highly significant
      clinical improvement and high patient`s overall satisfaction with very low
      revision rates at 2 years.

TI  - Comparison of surface roughness and color stability of different denture
      characterizing composite resins: the effect of different surface treatments.
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13577 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of surface treatment and type
      of composite resin material on the color stability and surface roughness of
      different denture characterizing composites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two
      nanohybrids [Gradia Plus Gum, (GP) and SR Nexco Paste Gingiva, (SR)] and one
      microhybrid gingiva-colored composite resin (Amaris Gingiva, (AG)] were
      investigated. A total of 120 disk-shaped samples were prepared, 40 of each
      material. Samples were divided into two groups (n = 20) for each material
      according to the surface treatment applied: conventional polishing (control) and 
      coated with a sealant in addition to the surface polishing. All groups were
      thermocycled. The surface roughness (Ra) was measured using a profilometer after 
      thermal cycling. The samples were then divided into 2 subgroups (n = 10) and
      stored for 7 days in distilled water or coffee solution. Color differences
      (DeltaE00 ) were calculated with a spectrophotometer. Results were evaluated with
      Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U statistical analysis. RESULTS: The type of
      denture characterizing composite material and surface treatment method revealed
      statistically significant differences for the DeltaE00 (after immersion both in
      coffee and distilled water) and the Ra values of denture characterizing composite
      (p < 0.001 for both). All sealed groups showed significantly higher Ra than the
      all polished groups. Both in the polished groups and the sealant applied groups, 
      the GP had the highest mean Ra values (0.29 +/-0.05 mum and 0.47 +/-0.09 mum,
      respectively). It was followed by SR (0.23 +/-0.06 mum and 0.41 +/-0.10 mum,
      respectively), and AG groups (0.20 +/-0.06 mum and 0.39 +/-0.09 mum,
      respectively). According to the mean DeltaE00 results, all composite groups
      showed significantly higher DeltaE00 values immersed in coffee solutions compared
      to distilled water. In coffee solutions, the highest DeltaE00 was observed in the
      polished GP (1.90 +/-0.40), and the lowest DeltaE00 was observed in the polished 
      SR (0.97 +/-0.36). The sealed groups showed higher DeltaE00 than the polished
      groups, except for GP. CONCLUSIONS: The surface roughness value of sealant
      applied groups were significantly higher than those of their polished groups. The
      surface sealant application significantly increased the staining of all composite
      groups compared to conventional polishing, except for GP. This article is

TI  - Use of single-energy proton pencil beam scanning Bragg peak for
      intensity-modulated proton therapy FLASH treatment planning in liver
      hypofractionated radiation therapy.
LID - 10.1002/mp.15894 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The transmission proton FLASH technique delivers high doses to the
      normal tissue distal to the target, which is less conformal compared to the Bragg
      peak technique. To investigate FLASH RT planning using single-energy Bragg peak
      beams with a similar beam arrangement as clinical intensity-modulated proton
      therapy (IMPT) in liver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and to
      characterize the plan quality, dose sparing of organs-at-risk (OARs), and FLASH
      dose rate percentage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An in-house platform was developed
      to enable inverse IMPT-FLASH planning using single-energy Bragg peaks. A
      universal range shifter and range compensators were utilized to effectively align
      the Bragg peak to the distal edge of the target. Two different minimum MU
      settings of 400 and 800 MU/spot (Bragg-400MU and Bragg-800MU) plans were
      investigated on 10 consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma patients previously
      treated by IMPT-SBRT to evaluate the FLASH dose and dose rate coverage for OARs. 
      The IMPT-FLASH using single-energy Bragg peaks delivered 50 Gy in 5 fractions
      with similar or identical beam arrangement to the clinical IMPT-SBRT plans. NRG
      GI003 dose constraint metrics were used. Three dose rate calculation methods,
      including average dose rate (ADR), dose threshold dose rate (DTDR), and
      dose-averaged dose rate (DADR), were all studied. RESULTS: The novel spot map
      optimization can fulfill the inverse planning using single-energy Bragg peaks.
      All the Bragg peak FLASH plans achieved similar results for the liver-GTV Dmean
      and heart D0.5cc , compared to SBRT-IMPT. The Bragg-800MU plans resulted in 18.3%
      higher CTV D2cc compared with SBRT (p < 0.05), and no significant difference was 
      found between Bragg-400MU and SBRT plans. For the CTV Dmax , SBRT plans resulted 
      in 10.3% (p<0.01) less than Bragg-400MU plans and 16.6% (p<0.01) less than
      Bragg-800MU plans. The Bragg-800MU plans generally achieved higher ADR, DADR, and
      DTDR dose rates than Bragg-400MU plans, and DADR mostly led to the highest
      V40Gy/s compared to other dose rate calculation methods, whereas ADR led to the
      lowest. The lower dose rate portions in certain OARs are related to the lower
      dose deposited due to the farther distances from targets, especially in the
      penumbra of the beams. CONCLUSION: Single-energy Bragg peak IMPT-FLASH plans
      eliminate the exit dose in normal tissues, maintaining comparable dose metrics to
      the conventional IMPT-SBRT plans while achieving a sufficient FLASH dose rate for
      liver cancers. This study demonstrates the feasibility of and sufficiently high
      dose rate when applying Bragg peak FLASH treatment for liver cancer
      hypofractionated FLASH therapy. The advancement of this novel method has the
      potential to optimize treatment for liver cancer patients. This article is

TI  - Association of longitudinal left atrial strain with mortality after tricuspid
      valve surgery.
LID - 10.1002/ehf2.14057 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Tricuspid valve (TV) surgery for functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is
      becoming more common, but the associated mortality remains high. Therefore, we
      evaluated the clinical and echocardiographic parameters associated with all-cause
      mortality in patients with severe functional TR who underwent TV surgery. METHODS
      AND RESULTS: A total of 286 patients with severe functional TR who underwent TV
      replacement or repair was analysed between January 2006 and December 2017. We
      assessed changes in conventional echocardiographic parameters and strain, such as
      peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS). During a median follow-up period of 5.3
      years, 71 (24.8%) patients died due to any cause. When comparing groups with and 
      without all-cause deaths, there were no significant differences in terms of sex, 
      co-morbidities, medication use, and surgery type. However, patients who died were
      older and more likely to have refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). With
      multivariate Cox modelling, age >65 years (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.81, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.59-4.96; P < 0.001), refractory AF (adjusted HR,
      2.84, 95% CI, 1.36-5.94; P = 0.006), lower albumin level (adjusted HR, 0.50, 95% 
      CI, 0.31-0.82), and reduced PALS (adjusted HR, 1.87, 95% CI, 1.06-3.33; P =
      0.032) were significant determinants of all-cause mortality. PALS decline was
      associated with refractory AF (adjusted HR, 5.74, 95% CI, 2.81-11.7; P < 0.001)
      and the absence of a Maze procedure (adjusted HR, 2.95, 95% CI, 1.51-5.78; P =
      0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in PALS was significantly associated with
      all-cause mortality in our cohort of patients with severe functional TR who
      underwent TV surgery. This phenomenon is related to refractory AF and more
      aggressive intervention for AF is necessary concomitant with TV surgery.

TI  - Factors predictive of adherence to a non-pharmacological intervention in nursing 
      home research: a substudy of the LEDEN trial
PG  - 199-207
LID - 10.1684/pnv.2022.1037 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Few older people participate in medical research, especially in the
      nursing home setting. The lack of evidence in this population may limit our
      ability to provide evidence-based treatments. This can partly be explained by
      difficulties in obtaining a satisfactory adherence to research in this
      population, especially when the practice of a physical activity is needed. In
      this study data from the LEDEN trial (Effects of a Long-term Exercise Program on 
      Functional Ability in People with Dementia Living in Nursing Homes: A Cluster
      Randomized Controlled Trial) was used to determine the predictors of adherence to
      the study protocol. Methods: Retrospective cohort study based on the data from
      the cluster randomized, controlled LEDEN trial. The LEDEN trial aimed to compare 
      the effects of an exercise intervention with a nonphysical intervention on the
      ability to perform activities of daily living. Predictors of adherence (being
      present at >/= 75% of sessions of the LEDEN trial) were identified by
      multivariable logistic regression. Results: By univariate analysis, the EVIBE
      scale (EValuation Immediate du Bien-Etre - evaluation of instantaneous
      well-being) measured at baseline was associated with study adherence, whereby
      higher scores were associated with higher adherence: 16.7% (1/6), 44.4% (4/9),
      56.5% (13/23), 48.1% (13/27) and 75.0% (15/20) respectively for EVIBE scores from
      1 to 5 (P = 0.02 for trend). By multi-variable analysis, an EVIBE scale score >/=
      4 did not predict clinical trial adherence (odds ratio [OR] 1.554, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 0.619-3.942). Adherence was found to be lower among persons aged
      >/= 95 years (OR: 0.121, 95%CI: 0.006-0.982). Conclusion: Older age (>/= 95
      years) was associated with lower adherence to the study protocol. Further studies
      are needed to better understand and anticipate obstacles to adherence in
      research, while respecting consent procedures and patient autonomy.

      75 years
PG  - 182-189

AB  - Organized breast cancer screening in France is recommended for women up to 74
      years of age, while the frequency and severity of this cancer increases after 75 
      years. The aim of this work is to assess the potential benefits of extending
      organized screening. Methodology: Retrospective study of a continuous monocentric
      series of women over 75 having undergone surgery for breast cancer. The following
      variables were studied: addressing after screening or not, age at diagnosis, UICC
      stage and therapeutic measures (surgery by lumpectomy or mastectomy, lymph node
      dissection, adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormone
      therapy). Results: 185 women aged 82.8 +/- 5.2 years [extreme ages 75 to 95] were
      included in the study. 136 (73.5%) breast cancers were discovered after palpation
      and 49 (26.5%) after screening mammography. The distribution by stage was: I -
      38.8%, II - 39.5%, III - 15.1% and stage IV - 7%. 164 (87.7%), patients received 
      surgical treatment: 115 lumpectomies (61.2%) and 49 mastectomies (26.5%). 51
      (27.6%) patients underwent lymph node dissection. The distribution of adjuvant
      treatments was: chemotherapy 21.1%, radiotherapy 68.6%, or hormone therapy
      (79.5%), sometimes combined. Women not screened are older than women screened (84
      +/- 5.3 versus 79.5 +/- 3.6 years; p < 0.0001). Cancers are diagnosed at a more
      advanced stage in non-screened patients compared to screened patients (p <
      0.0001). While there is a higher proportion of stage I among screened patients
      (75.5%), stage II is the most frequent in women not screened (47%). Stage I and
      II are the majority in the latter (72%). In multivariate analysis with adjustment
      for age, screening made it possible to make a diagnosis at a less advanced stage 
      (stage I-II vs II-IV: OR = 5.593; 95% CI [1.575-19.866]; p = 0.0078) and to have 
      conservative surgery more often (lumpectomy vs mastectomy: OR = 2.645; 95% CI
      [1.079-6.493]; p = 0.0333) without more recourse to surgery (OR = 1.856 95% CI
      [0.207-16.612]; p = 0.58). After adjusting for age and stage, screening was no
      longer a determining factor in the choice of type of surgery (OR = 1.934; 95% CI 
      [0.753-4.975]; p = 0.170). Conclusion: At the age when organized breast cancer
      screening in France stopped, there was a decrease in survival, a diagnosis at a
      higher stage and an increase in co-morbidities. Our study shows a change in
      management with heavier treatment, more complications and a greater loss of
      autonomy without screening. This pleads for a continuation beyond 75 years of the
      practice of mammography screening for breast cancer in elderly women.

TI  - The immediate impact of Covid-19 infection and the resulting lockdown on nursing 
      home residents
PG  - 173-181
LID - 10.1684/pnv.2022.1034 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Following the Covid-19 epidemic affecting 76 of the 97 residents
      (78.3 %) in a French nursing home, we assessed the impact of this cluster period 
      on the physical and psycho-cognitive health of the residents, expecting in
      particular to observe effects that were dependent on their state of
      cognitive-behavioural dependence. Methods: We retained twenty-two variables, 5
      relating to demographic data, 6 to the specific care linked to Covid-19
      infection, 6 to somatic pathologies and psycho-behavioural disturbances before
      the epidemic and 5 to the period following it. Results: Eleven residents among
      those diagnosed positive died. Nine were transferred to a Covid unit, and 35 were
      asymptomatic. The main consequences of the period of infections were in
      particular behavioural, nutritional, and motor. A history of disruptive
      behaviours before the appearance of the cluster increased the risk of an
      aggravation of these behaviours by four (RR = 3.9, IC95 % = 1.38-11.02, p =
      0.0042). Twenty per cent of the residents presented under-nutrition at the end of
      lockdown, but no specific risk factors could be identified. However, states of
      under-nutrition for the whole of 2020 were significantly more frequent than in
      2019, in particular severe cases (chi(2) = 5.43, p = 0.02). A history of
      under-nutrition in the previous year increased twofold the likelihood of
      under-nutrition in the following year (RR = 2.07, IC95 % = 1.14-3.74, p = 0.02). 
      The Covid cluster period also had an effect on the functional autonomy of certain
      patients. Conclusion: Our main hypothesis relating to cognitive-behavioural
      dependence was not completely validated. The impact of the occurrence of the
      cluster remained moderate, in particular because of the care resources afforded
      by the nursing home. The advantages of a "medicalised" facility, and the problems
      associated with the restrictions of lockdown, are viewed in the light of ethical 
      considerations.

TI  - Clinical profile and care pathways of nursing home residents having the
      intervention of hospital at home and comparison according to the referrers
PG  - 190-198
LID - 10.1684/pnv.2022.1033 [doi]
AB  - Background: Nursing homes' (NH) residents present a mix of medical, psychological
      and social needs associated with a high risk of hospitalization. The intervention
      of the hospitalization at home (HAH) in NH has been implemented in France to
      better fit the residents' needs and decrease the risk of hospitalization. No
      study has described the population of residents receiving this intervention. This
      study aimed to define the profile and the care pathway of residents and compare
      their characteristics according to the referrals (NH or hospitals). Methods: A
      retrospective study on 1,436 residents' stays in the intervention of the
      Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris'HAH in Ile de France between 2014 and 2019 
      was implemented. The Programme de Medicalisation des Systemes d'Information
      (PMSI) data was used for the analysis. Results: Residents were 88 years old with 
      69 % of women with functional disability and the care was mainly represented by
      the complex dressing (68 %). For the care pathway, 65 % of the referrers were
      from the NH and 35 % from the hospital settings, 33 % of the residents died at
      the end of the stay in the NH and 25 % were transferred to hospitals. When the
      referrer was the hospital, the residents were mainly men (p < 0.001), younger (p 
      < 0.001), receiving more often intravenous treatment and palliative care (p <
      0.01) with a higher level of indice of Karnofsky (p < 0.01). When the NH was the 
      referrer, deaths were more frequent, whereas the transfers to hospitals were less
      common (p < 0.001). Discussion : Residents had complex clinical situation and
      their care pathway were different according to the referrer. From the NH, the HAH
      was used to provide more often end of life care, and from hospital setting, the
      residents received more acute care with a higher risk of readmission. Readmission
      causes should be analyzed.

      Phellinus species.
PG  - e14364
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14364 [doi]
AB  - In light of the powerful therapeutic features of Phellinus species and due to the
      absence of toxic compounds, our investigations were aimed at screening of the
      antioxidant profile of fortified yogurts with hot water extracts from Phellinus
      torulosus and Phellinus igniarius leveled to 10%, 5%, and 1% final fortification 
      concentrations after acknowledging their superior bioactive content and radical
      scavenging capacities (59.77% and 56.73% of DPPH inhibition, respectively) versus
      cold water extracts (29.87% and 33.18% inhibition rates). Fortified samples
      signified dose-dependent increases in their inhibition rates during the storage
      period, with significant differences between 10% fortifications on the 7 day of
      storage in favor of the samples fortified with P. torulosus. Explicitly, P.
      torulosus showed 16% higher DPPH and 62.5% higher LPO neutralizing activity than 
      yogurt enriched with P. igniarius. However, prolonged refrigeration tended to
      equalize antioxidant profiles in both fortified yogurts. Total titratable acidity
      and pH levels of the fortified yogurts as most important parameters for consumer 
      acceptance were unaltered during storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: It is a common 
      scientific perception that bioactive compounds present in wild medicinal fungi
      are the main contributors for their in vitro antioxidant efficiency. On account
      of these attributes, Phellinus species have been exploited in Far East Asia as
      safe remedies for many disorders thus making them attractive fortifying
      ingredients; however, according to our knowledge these mushrooms have never been 
      used as natural additives in beverages. Given the current popularity of yogurt
      consumption as seen from the global market profits, as well as experimental
      evidences of enhanced potency of extract in comparison with powder due to maximal
      bioavailability of antioxidants, it is our belief that this study will increase
      the interest in the manufacture of functional foods with extracts from wild
      mushrooms.

TI  - An RxLR effector from Plasmopara viticola suppresses plant immunity in grapevine 
      by targeting and stabilizing VpBPA1.
LID - 10.1111/tpj.15933 [doi]
AB  - Grapevine downy mildew, caused by Plasmopara viticola, is one of the most
      devastating diseases in viticulture. P. viticola secretes RxLR effectors to
      modulate immune responses in grapevine. Here, we report an RxLR effector
      RxLR50253 from P. viticola that can interfere with plant immune response and thus
      promote pathogen colonization. RxLR50253 was induced at an early stage of P.
      viticola infection and could suppress elicitor (INF1 and Bax)-triggered cell
      death. RxLR50253 promote pathogen colonization in both tobacco and grapevine
      leaves. VpBPA1 was found to be the host target of RxLR50253 by Y2H screening, and
      interaction between RxLR50253 and VpBPA1 was confirmed by multiple in vivo and in
      vitro assays. Further analysis revealed that VpBPA1 promoted pathogen
      colonization and decreased H2 O2 accumulation in transgenic tobacco and
      grapevine, while there was enhanced resistance and H2 O2 accumulation in
      NbBPA1-silenced N. benthamiana leaves. Moreover, transient expression of VpBPA1
      in NbBPA1-silenced N. benthamiana leaves could reduce the accumulation of H2 O2 .
      Experiments in vivo demonstrated that RxLR50253 inhibits degradation of VpBPA1.
      Taken together, our findings showed that RxLR50253 targets and stabilizes VpBPA1 
      to attenuate plant immunity through decreasing H2 O2 accumulation during pathogen
      infection.

TI  - Enhanced Recovery After Cleft Palate Repair: A Quality Improvement Project.
LID - 10.1111/pan.14541 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children undergoing cleft palate repair present challenges to
      postoperative management due to several factors that can complicate recovery.
      Utilization of multimodal analgesic protocols can improve outcomes in this
      population. We report experience designing and implementing an enhanced recovery 
      after surgery (ERAS) pathway for cleft palate repair to optimize postoperative
      recovery. AIMS: The primary aim was to implement an ERAS pathway with >70% bundle
      adherence to achieve a 30% reduction in postoperative opioid consumption within
      12 months. Our secondary aims assessed intraoperative opioid consumption, length 
      of stay (LOS), timeliness of oral intake, and respiratory recovery. METHODS: A
      multidisciplinary team of perioperative providers developed an ERAS pathway for
      cleft palate patients. Key drivers included patient and provider education,
      formal pathway creation and implementation, multimodal pain therapy, and
      target-based care. Interventions included maxillary nerve blockade and enhanced
      intra- and postoperative medication regimens. Outcomes were displayed as
      statistical process control charts. RESULTS: Pathway compliance was 77.0%.
      Patients during the intervention period (n=39) experienced a 49% reduction in
      postoperative opioid consumption (p<0.0001) relative to our historical cohort
      (n=63), with a mean difference of -0.33 +/- 0.11 mg/kg (95% CI -0.55 to -0.12
      mg/kg). Intraoperative opioid consumption was reduced by 36% (p=0.002), with a
      mean difference of -0.27 +/- 0.09 mg/kg (95% CI -0.45 to -0.09 mg/kg).
      Additionally, patients in the intervention group had a 45% reduction in time to
      first oral intake (p=0.02) relative to our historical cohort, with a mean
      difference of -3.81 +/- 1.56 hours (95% CI -6.9 to -0.70). There was no
      difference in PACU or hospital LOS, but there was a significant reduction in
      variance of all secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Opioid reduction and improved
      timeliness of oral intake is possible with an ERAS protocol for cleft palate
      repair, but our protocol did not alter PACU or hospital LOS.

TI  - Are all fibers created equal with respect to lipid lowering? Comparing the effect
      of viscous dietary fiber to non-viscous fiber from cereal sources: A systematic
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 1-35
LID - 10.1017/S0007114522002355 [doi]
AB  - Although compelling evidence from observational studies supports a positive
      association between consumption of cereal fiber and cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
      risk reduction, randomized clinical trials (RCT)s often target viscous fiber type
      as the prospective contributor to lipid lowering to reduce CVD risk. The
      objective of our study is to compare the lipids lowering effects of viscous
      dietary fiber to non-viscous, cereal-type fiber in clinical studies. RCTs that
      evaluated the effect of viscous dietary fiber compared to non-viscous, cereal
      fiber on LDL cholesterol and alternative lipid markers, with duration of >/= 3
      weeks, in adults with or without hypercholesterolemia were included. Medline,
      EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register were searched through October
      19, 2021. Data was extracted and assessed by 2 independent reviewers. The generic
      inverse variance method with random effects model was utilized to pool the data
      which were expressed as mean differences (MD)s with 95% confidence intervals
      (CI). Eighty-nine trials met eligibility criteria (n = 4755). Mean differences
      for the effect of viscous dietary fiber compared to non-viscous cereal fiber
      were: LDL cholesterol (MD = -0.26 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.30, -0.22 mmol/L; P < 0.01),
      non-HDL cholesterol (MD = -0.33 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.39, -0.28 mmol/L; P < 0.01),
      and Apo-B (MD = -0.04 g/L; 95% CI: -0.06, -0.03 g/L; P < 0.01). Viscous dietary
      fiber reduces LDL cholesterol and alternative lipid markers relative to the fiber
      from cereal sources, hence may be a preferred type of fiber-based dietary
      intervention targeting cardiovascular disease risk reduction.

      power in men.
PG  - 1-21
LID - 10.1017/S0007114522002501 [doi]
AB  - Low intake or tissue concentrations of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFA), especially to the major n-6 PUFA linoleic acid (LA), and low exercise
      cardiac power (ECP) are both associated with cardiovascular disease risk.
      However, associations of the n-6 PUFAs with ECP are unknown. The aim of the
      present study was to explore cross-sectional associations of the serum total n-6 
      PUFA, LA, arachidonic acid (AA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and
      dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) concentrations with ECP and its components. In
      total, 1685 men aged 42-60 years from the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk
      Factor Study and free of cardiovascular diseases were included. Analysis of
      covariance was used to examine the mean values of ECP (maximal oxygen uptake
      (VO2max)/maximal systolic blood pressure (SBP)) and its components in quartiles
      of the serum total and individual n-6 PUFA concentrations. After multivariable
      adjustments, higher serum total n-6 PUFA concentration was associated with higher
      ECP and VO2max [for ECP, the extreme-quartile difference was 0.77 mL/mmHg (95%CI 
      0.38-1.16, P-trend across quartiles <0.001) and for VO2max 157 mL/min (95%CI
      85-230, P-trend<0.001)], but not with maximal SBP. Similar associations were
      observed with serum LA concentration. Higher serum AA concentration was
      associated with higher ECP but not with VO2max or maximal SBP. The minor serum
      n-6 PUFAs GLA and DGLA were associated with higher maximal SBP during exercise
      test and DGLA also with higher VO2max but neither with ECP. In conclusion,
      especially LA concentration was associated with higher ECP. This may provide one 
      mechanism for the cardioprotective properties of especially LA.

AB  - The adaptive foam reticulation technique combines the foam reticulation and
      freeze casting methodologies of fabricating bone reparative scaffolds to offer a 
      potential alternative to autografts. For the first time this paper studies the
      effect of processing on the mechanical properties and in-vitro cell growth of
      controllably generating a hierarchical structure of macro- (94 +/- 6 to 514 +/-
      36 mum) and microporosity (2-30 mum) by the inclusion of camphene as a porogen
      during processing. Scaffolds were produced with porogen additions of 0-25 wt%.
      Porosity values of the structures of 85-96% were determined using the Archimedes 
      technique and verified using X-ray Computed Tomography. The strength of the
      hydroxyapatite scaffolds, 5.70 +/- 1.0 to 159 +/- 61 kPa, correlated to
      theoretically determined values, 3.71 +/- 0.8 to 134 +/- 12 kPa, calculated by
      the novel incorporation of a shape factor into a standard equation. Fibroblast
      (3T3) and pre-osteoblast (MC3T3) cell growth was found to be significantly (P <
      0.005) improved using 25 wt% porogen. This was supported by increased levels of
      alkaline phosphatase and was thought to result from greater dissolution as
      quantified by increased calcium levels in incubating media. The combination of
      these properties renders adaptive foam reticulation-fabricated scaffolds suitable
      for non-structural bone regenerative applications in non-load bearing bone
      defects.

AB  - Tear protein deposition resistance and antimicrobial property are two challenges 
      of conventional poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) contact lenses. In this
      work, we developed a poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-quaternary ammonium salt
      chitosan) hydrogel, named as p(HEMA-co-mHACC) hydrogel, using acryloyl HACC
      (mHACC) as a macromolecular crosslinker. With increasing the acryloyl
      substitution degree (14-29%) or mHACC content (2-11%), the hydrogel showed an
      enhanced tensile strength (432-986 kPa) and Young's modulus (360-1158 kPa), a
      decreased elongation at break (242-84%), and an increased visible light
      transmittance (0-95%). At an optimal acryloyl substitution degree of 26%, with
      the increase of mHACC content from 2% to 11%, p(HEMA-co-mHACC) hydrogel presented
      a decreased water contact angle from 84.6 to 55.3 degree, an increased
      equilibrium water content from 38% to 45%, and an enhanced oxygen permeability
      from 8.5 to 13.5 barrer. Due to the enhancement in surface hydrophilicity and
      electropositivity, p(HEMA-co-mHACC) hydrogel remarkably reduced the deposition of
      lysozyme, but little affected the adsorption of BSA, depending on the
      hydrophilic/hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The antimicrobial test
      against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli showed that p(HEMA-co-mHACC)
      hydrogel presented an 8-32 times higher germicidal ability than pHEMA hydrogel,
      indicative of a better antimicrobial activity. The in vitro cell culture of mouse
      NIH3T3 fibroblasts and immortalized human keratinocytes showed that
      p(HEMA-co-mHACC) hydrogel was non-toxic. Thus, p(HEMA-co-mHACC) hydrogel with
      tear protein deposition resistance and antimicrobial activity is a potential
      candidate for contact lenses.

TI  - COVID-19 during the index hospital admission confers a 'double-hit' effect on hip
      fracture patients and is associated with a two-fold increase in 1-year mortality 
      risk.
LID - 10.1002/msc.1674 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aims were to: (1) determine 1-year mortality rates for hip fracture 
      patients during the first UK COVID-19 wave, and (2) assess mortality risk
      associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A nationwide multicentre cohort study was
      conducted of all patients presenting to 17 hospitals in March-April 2020.
      Follow-up data were collected one year after initial hip fracture ('index')
      admission, including: COVID-19 status, readmissions, mortality, and cause of
      death. RESULTS: Data were available for 788/833 (94.6%) patients. One-year
      mortality was 242/788 (30.7%), and the prevalence of COVID-19 within 365 days of 
      admission was 142/788 (18.0%). One-year mortality was higher for patients with
      COVID-19 (46.5% vs. 27.2%; p < 0.001), and highest for those COVID-positive
      during index admission versus after discharge (54.7% vs. 39.7%; p = 0.025).
      Anytime COVID-19 was independently associated with 50% increased mortality risk
      within a year of injury (HR 1.50, p = 0.006); adjusted mortality risk doubled (HR
      2.03, p < 0.001) for patients COVID-positive during index admission. No
      independent association was observed between mortality risk and COVID-19
      diagnosed following discharge (HR 1.16, p = 0.462). Most deaths (56/66; 84.8%) in
      COVID-positive patients occurred within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis (median
      11.0 days). Most cases diagnosed following discharge from the admission hospital 
      occurred in downstream hospitals. CONCLUSION: Almost half the patients that had
      COVID-19 within 365 days of fracture had died within one year of injury versus
      27.2% of COVID-negative patients. Only COVID-19 diagnosed during the index
      admission was associated independently with an increased likelihood of death,
      indicating that infection during this time may represent a 'double-hit' insult,
      and most COVID-related deaths occurred within 30 days of diagnosis.

AB  - Enamel is the highest mineralized tissue in the body protecting teeth from
      external stimuli, infections, and injuries. Enamel lacks the ability to
      self-repair due to the absence of enamel-producing cells in the erupted teeth.
      Here, we reported a novel approach to promote enamel-like tissue formation via
      the delivery of a key ameloblast inducer, T-box1 gene, into a rat dental
      epithelial stem cell line, HAT-7, using non-viral gene delivery systems based on 
      cationic lipids. We comparatively assessed the lipoplexes prepared from
      glycyl-lysine-modified gemini surfactants and commercially available
      1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane lipids at three nitrogen-to phosphate
      (N/P) ratios of 2.5, 5 and 10. Our findings revealed that physico-chemical
      characteristics and biological activities of the gemini surfactant-based
      lipoplexes with a N/P ratio of 5 provide the most optimal outcomes among those
      examined. HAT-7 cells were transfected with T-box1 gene using the optimal
      formulation then cultured in conventional 2D cell culture systems. Ameloblast
      differentiation, mineralization, bio-enamel interface and structure were assessed
      at different time points over 28 days. Our results showed that our gemini
      transfection system provides superior gene expression compared to the benchmark
      agent, while keeping low cytotoxicity levels. T-box1-transfected HAT-7 cells
      strongly expressed markers of secretory and maturation stages of the ameloblasts,
      deposited minerals, and produced enamel-like crystals when compared to control
      cells. Taken together, our gemini surfactant-based T-box1 gene delivery system is
      effective to accelerate and guide ameloblastic differentiation of dental
      epithelial stem cells and promote enamel-like tissue formation. This study would 
      represent a significant advance towards the tissue engineering and regeneration
      of dental enamel.

AB  - Concave surfaces have shown to promote bone regeneration in vivo. However, bone
      scaffolds obtained by direct ink writing, one of the most promising approaches
      for the fabrication of personalized bone grafts, consist mostly of convex
      surfaces, since they are obtained by microextrusion of cylindrical strands. By
      modifying the geometry of the nozzle, it is possible to print 3D structures
      composed of non-cylindrical strands and favor the presence of concave surfaces.
      In this work, we compare the in vivo performance of 3D-printed calcium phosphate 
      scaffolds with either conventional cylindrical strands or star-shaped strands, in
      a rabbit femoral condyle model. Monocortical defects, drilled in contralateral
      positions, are randomly grafted with the two scaffold configurations, with
      identical composition. The samples are explanted eight weeks post-surgery and
      assessed by mu-CT and resin-embedded histological observations. The results
      reveal that the scaffolds containing star-shaped strands have better
      osteoconductive properties, guiding the newly formed bone faster towards the core
      of the scaffolds, and enhance bone regeneration, although the increase is not
      statistically significant (p > 0.05). This new approach represents a turning
      point towards the optimization of pore shape in 3D-printed bone grafts, further
      boosting the possibilities that direct ink writing technology offers for
      patient-specific applications.

AB  - Biotin film was prepared by low-energy electron beam deposition (LEBD). The
      molecular structure, chemical composition and micromorphology of the biotin film 
      were investigated by (1)HNMR, FTIR, XPS, AFM and SEM. The results showed the
      molecular structure of a monolayer of biotin film is fully consistent with the
      molecular structure of the initial biotin powders. The contact angle test showed 
      that the biotin film exhibit good hydrophilicity. The release kinetics of biotin 
      film was tested by UV-Vis method. It was found that the film was almost
      completely released in about two weeks. The cell viability of MC3T3-E1 cells on
      the surface of the biotin film was attaining 100.54 +/- 1.7% (P < 0.05), showing 
      excellent biocompatibility and biosafety. Titanium implant with surface of biotin
      film was implanted into the femoral head of rabbits as experimental group. The
      animals were euthanized after four weeks. Compared with the control group, mature
      lamellar bone formation was observed with dense trabecular bone, and the
      expression of Coll-I, Runx2 and BMP-2 was better. The results showed that the
      repair effect of bone defect in the experimental group was excellent.

AB  - Oral wounds are among the most troublesome injuries which easily affect the
      patients' quality of life. To date, the development of functional antibacterial
      dressings for oral wound healing remains a challenge. In this regard, we
      investigated antibacterial silk protein-based membranes for the application as
      wound dressings in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The present study includes
      five variants of casted membranes, i.e., i) membranes-silver nanoparticles
      (CM-Ag), ii) membranes-gentamicin (CM-G), iii) membranes-control (without
      functionalization) (CM-C), iv) membranes-silk sericin control (CM-SSC), and v)
      membranes-silk fibroin/silk sericin (CM-SF/SS), and three variants of nonwovens, 
      i.e., i) silver nanoparticles (NW-Ag), ii) gentamicin (NW-G), iii) control
      (without functionalization) (NW-C). The surface structure of the samples was
      visualized with scanning electron microscopy. In addition, antibacterial testing 
      was accomplished using agar diffusion assay, colony forming unit (CFU) analysis, 
      and qrt-PCR. Following antibacterial assays, biocompatibility was evaluated by
      cell proliferation assay (XTT), cytotoxicity assay (LDH), and live-dead assay on 
      L929 mouse fibroblasts. Findings indicated significantly lower bacterial colony
      growth and DNA counts for CM-Ag with a reduction of bacterial counts by 3log
      levels (99.9% reduction) in CFU and qrt-PCR assay compared to untreated control
      membranes (CM-C and CM-SSC) and membranes functionalized with gentamicin (CM-G
      and NW-G) (p < 0.001). Similarly, NW-G yielded significantly lower DNA and colony
      growth counts compared to NW-Ag and NW-C (p < 0.001). In conclusion, CM-Ag
      represented 1log level better antibacterial activity compared to NW-G, whereas
      NW-G showed better cytocompatibility for L929 cells. As data suggest, these two
      membranes have the potential of application in the field of bacteria-free oral
      wound healing. However, provided that loading strategy and cytocompatibility are 
      adjusted according to the antibacterial agents' characteristic and fabrication
      technique of the membranes.

TI  - How adenomyosis changes throughout pregnancy: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 10.1002/ijgo.14383 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study how adenomyosis modifies during pregnancy and to possibly
      correlate these changes to maternal and fetal outcomes METHODS: Retrospective
      exploratory cohort study including 254 women with a pre-conceptional/1st
      trimester scan to document adenomyosis and known obstetric outcome. If visible,
      adenomyosis signs were documented in each trimester and post-partum. Mann Whitney
      U-tests or Chi-square tests were used for continuous/categorical variables
      respectively. RESULTS: A globular uterus was reported in 79% women with
      adenomyosis in the 1st trimester, in 38% and 2% women in the 2nd and 3rd
      trimester respectively and in the post-partum in 65% women. Asymmetrical
      thickening (30%) and cysts (23%) were only visible in 1st trimester. Adenomyosis 
      was associated with miscarriage (OR 5.9, CI95% 2.4-14.9, p<0.001) also in normal 
      conception only (OR 5.1 95%CI 1.8-14.2, p=0.002) or adjusting for maternal age
      (aOR 5.9, CI95% 2.3-15.2, p<0.001). Gestational age at delivery was lower in
      adenomyosis (p=0.004); the Caesarean Section (CS) rate was higher than in
      controls (OR 2.5, CI95% 1.3-4.8, p=0.007) also adjusting for age (aOR 2.07, CI95%
      1.06-4.08, p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Signs of adenomyosis were visible but
      progressively disappeared in pregnancy; adenomyosis was associated with an
      increased risk of early miscarriage. Prospective studies are needed to confirm
      our results.

TI  - Hormones, age, and sex affect platelet responsiveness in vitro.
LID - 10.1111/trf.17054 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Female sex confers a survival advantage following severe injury in
      the setting of trauma-induced coagulopathy, with female platelets having
      heightened responsiveness likely due to estrogen. The effects of testosterone on 
      platelet biology are unknown, and platelets express both estradiol and androgen
      receptors on the plasma membrane. We hypothesize testosterone decreases platelet 
      responses in vitro, and there are baseline differences in platelet function and
      metabolism stratified by sex/age. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis platelets
      were collected from: older males (OM) >/=45 years, younger males (YM) <45 years, 
      older females (OF) >/=54 years, and younger females (YF) <54 years, and
      testosterone and estradiol were measured. Platelets were incubated with
      testosterone (5.31 ng/ml), estradiol (105 pg/ml) or vehicle and stimulated with
      buffer, adenosine diphosphate (20 muM), platelet activating factor (2 muM), or
      thrombin (0.3 U/ml). Aggregation, CD62P surface expression, fibrinogen receptor
      surface expression, and platelet mitochondrial metabolism were measured. RESULTS:
      Testosterone significantly inhibited aggregation in OF and OM (p < .05),
      inhibited CD41a expression in YF, YM, and OM (p < .05), and affected a few of the
      baseline amounts of CD62P surface expression but not platelet activation to
      platelet-activating factor and adenosine diphosphate, and variably changed
      platelet metabolism. DISCUSSION: Platelets have sex- and age-specific
      aggregation, receptor expression, and metabolism. Testosterone decreases platelet
      function dependent on the stimulus, age, and sex. Similarly, platelet metabolism 
      has varying responses to sex hormones with baseline metabolic differences
      dependent upon sex and age.

TI  - Translucency parameter and color masking ability of CAD/CAM denture base
      materials against metal substrates.
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13581 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the translucency parameters of traditional, milled, and
      3D-printed denture base materials at 3 different thicknesses and the color
      masking ability of each material against a metallic background between different 
      thicknesses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A traditional heat-polymerizing
      polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (H-Lucitone) material was used as the control
      group. Two milled pre-polymerized resin blocks (M-Lucitone and IvoBase) and five 
      3D-printed denture base materials (P-Lucitone, Dentca LP, Dentca OP, Formlabs,
      and Kulzer) were used as experimental groups. A total of 240 samples, (n = 30,
      per material) were fabricated to a final specimen dimension of 12x12 mm and in
      thicknesses of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mm (n = 10 per thickness/material) according to 
      the manufacturers' recommendations. The color coordinates (L*, a*, b*) in CIELab 
      color space for all specimens placed against a white, black, and metallic
      background were measured with a spectrophotometer. The translucency parameters
      (TP00 ) at each thickness and the color differences between 1 mm and 2 mm
      (dE00M1-2 ) and between 2 mm and 3 mm (dE00M2-3 ) against the metallic background
      were calculated with the CIEDE2000 color matrix. Comparisons between the groups
      for differences in TP00 were made using One-way ANOVA separately for each
      thickness. Comparisons of groups and materials for differences in dE00M1-2 and
      dE00M2-3 were made using Two-way ANOVA and Fisher's Protected Least Significant
      Differences (alpha = .05). RESULTS: The TP00 decreased with increasing thickness 
      in all 8 material groups. All 3D-printed materials, except P-Lucitone, had higher
      TP00 than milled pre-polymerized resin materials (M-Lucitone and IvoBase), and
      traditional heat-polymerizing PMMA (H-Lucitone) material (P<.001) at all
      thicknesses. In the 1 mm and 2 mm thickness, heat-polymerizing acrylic resin
      (H-Lucitone) had the lowest TP00 , and in the 3 mm thickness, milled acrylic
      resin (M-Lucitone and IVOBase) had had lowest TP00 (P<.001). All material groups 
      had significantly lower values of dE00M2-3 than dE00M1-2 (P<.001). The color
      differences dE00M2-3 were significantly lower in H-Lucitone, M-Lucitone,
      P-Lucitone, and IvoBase groups than in other materials, while the color
      difference of dE00M1-2 was significantly lower in H-Lucitone, P-Lucitone and
      Dentca LP than other materials (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study
      provide clinicians and dental technicians with information regarding the
      selection of denture base materials to achieve desired color masking outcomes,
      according to available prosthetic space. Thicker prostheses significantly
      improved the color masking abilities of denture acrylic resins against a metallic
      background. In a thickness of 1 and 2 mm, the heat-polymerizing acrylic resin had
      a lower translucency parameter and better color masking ability. When the
      prosthesis thickness reached 3 mm, the milled acrylic resin had a lower
      translucency parameter and better color masking ability. When compared to the
      heat-polymerizing resin and milled acrylic resin materials, except for one
      3D-printing resin (P-Lucitone), the color masking abilities of the remaining
      3D-printing resin materials were low, regardless of prosthesis thickness. This

TI  - Analysis of lumbar spine stenosis specimens for identification of amyloid.
LID - 10.1111/jgs.17976 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common reason for spine surgery in 
      which ligamentum flavum is resected. Transthyretin (TTR) amyloid is an often
      unrecognized and potentially modifiable mechanism for LSS that can also cause TTR
      cardiac amyloidosis. Accordingly, older adult patients undergoing lumbar spine
      (LS) surgery were evaluated for amyloid and if present, the precursor protein, as
      well as comprehensive characterization of the clinical phenotype. METHODS: A
      prospective, cohort study in 2 academic medical centers enrolled 47 subjects (age
      69 +/- 7 years, 53% male) undergoing clinically indicated LS decompression. The
      presence of amyloid was evaluated by Congo Red staining and in those with
      amyloid, precursor protein was determined by laser capture microdissection
      coupled to mass spectrometry (LCM-MS). The phenotype was assessed by
      disease-specific questionnaires (Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire and Kansas
      City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) and the 36-question short-form health survey, 
      as well as biochemical measures (TTR, retinol-binding protein, and TTR
      stability). Cardiac testing included technetium-99m-pyrophosphate scintigraphy,
      electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and cardiac biomarkers as well as measures
      of functional capacity. RESULTS: Amyloid was detected in 16 samples (34% of
      participants) and was more common in those aged >/= 75 years of age (66.7%)
      compared with those <75 years (22.3%, p < 0.05). LCM-MS demonstrated TTR as the
      precursor protein in 62.5% of participants with amyloid while 37.5% had an
      indeterminant type of amyloid. Demographic, clinical, quality-of-life measures,
      electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and biochemical measures did not differ 
      between those with and without amyloid. Among those with TTR amyloid (n = 10),
      one subject had cardiac involvement by scintigraphy. CONCLUSIONS: Amyloid is
      detected in more than a third of older adults undergoing LSS. Amyloid is more
      common with advancing age and is particularly common in those >75 years old. No
      demographic, clinical, biochemical, or cardiac parameter distinguished those with
      and without amyloid. In more than half of subjects with LS amyloid, the precursor
      protein was TTR indicating the importance of pathological assessment.

TI  - Downregulation of TRIM33 Promotes Survival and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition 
      in Gastric Cancer.
PG  - 15330338221114505
LID - 10.1177/15330338221114505 [doi]
AB  - Among all malignancies worldwide, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer 
      with the third highest mortality rate. One of the main reasons for the low
      survival rate is the recurrence and metastasis that occurs in many patients after
      surgery. Numerous studies have shown that abnormal TRIM33 expression is
      associated with the progression of malignant tumors. TRIM33 can function either
      as a tumor suppressor or tumor promoter in different cancers. Our data showed
      that TRIM33 was highly expressed in stomach cancer, and in human gastric cancer
      tissues, low expression of TRIM33 was associated with poor prognosis in patients 
      with gastric cancer. To clarify the function of TRIM33 in survival and
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer cells, we investigated the
      effect of TRIM33 knockdown in several gastric cancer cell lines. Downregulation
      of TRIM33 in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells enhanced the proliferation, colony
      formation, and migratory ability of these gastric cancer cells. It also promoted 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition; transfection of cells with siRNA targeting
      TRIM33 led to the upregulation of vimentin and N-Cadherin expression, and
      downregulation of E-Cadherin expression. Meanwhile, the transforming growth
      factor beta pathway was activated: levels of transforming growth factor beta were
      elevated and the expressions of p-Smad2, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 were activated. 
      To confirm the role of TRIM33 in vivo, a xenograft model was established in nude 
      mice. Immunohistochemical analysis identified that the protein levels of TRIM33, 
      p-Smad2, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, vimentin, and N-Cadherin were increased, and
      E-Cadherin levels were decreased, in xenograft tumors from the si-TRIM33 group.
      Taken together, these results suggest that TRIM33 may be a potential marker for
      the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer. Furthermore, it may also serve as 
      a novel target for gastric cancer treatment.

LID - 10.1177/15330338221110673 [doi]
AB  - Background: This study aimed to develop a prognostic model based on the
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to predict the
      overall survival (OS) of small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (SmCC).
      Methods: Between 1975 and 2016, a total of 401 patients were included, and their 
      comprehensive sociodemographic and clinicopathological characteristics were
      collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to screen 
      for independent prognostic factors. The identified factors were used to conduct a
      nomogram for predicting the OS of SmCC. The performance of the nomogram was
      determined using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC),
      concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA)
      metrics. Results: The median survival time of all patients was about 24 months
      (95% confidence interval [95% CI] [1.50-2.17]). Age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.693
      for 45-59 vs 21-34, 95% CI [1.140-2.513], P = .009; HR = 2.836 for 60-92 vs
      21-34, 95% CI [1.851-4.345], P < .001), positive nodes (HR = 2.384, 95% CI
      [1.437-3.955], P < .001), regional nodes number >/=12 (HR = 0.500, 95% CI
      [0.282-0.886], P = .018), and treatment method (HR = 0.409 for surgery vs no, 95%
      CI [0.267-0.628], P < .001; HR = 0.649 for chemotherapy vs no, 95% CI
      [0.478-0.881)], P = .006) were independent factors of OS. Young patients who had 
      surgical resection or chemotherapy, negative lymph nodes, and regional lymph
      nodes >/=12 had a longer survival time. These clinical factors were utilized to
      construct a nomogram for predicting OS. The AUC and C-index were higher than 0.7,
      indicating the good discriminating ability of the nomogram. The calibrations were
      all around the 45-degree line, indicating excellent consistency between the
      prediction of the model and actual observations. The DCA plots supported the
      clinical utility of the nomogram. Conclusion: The constructed nomogram is
      expected to help predict the prognosis of SmCC and guide patient treatment.

AB  - BCL10, a key activator of NF-kappaB downstream of oncogenic B-cell receptor
      signaling, is mutated in nearly 40% of the BN2/C1 genetic subtype of diffuse

TI  - Assessment of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and its associated factors among
      cervical cancer patients in the leading tertiary hospital in Kenya.
PG  - 10781552221119417
LID - 10.1177/10781552221119417 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cisplatin is the widely used antineoplastic agent in managing
      cervical cancer despite nephrotoxicity being a major concern. In addition, there 
      was a paucity of data about the degree of nephrotoxicity due to cisplatin in the 
      study setting. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of
      cisplatin nephrotoxicity among cervical patients. METHODS: A retrospective
      cross-sectional study was conducted at the Cancer Treatment Centre of Kenyatta
      National Hospital among 100 cervical cancer patients treated with a cisplatin
      regimen. Simple random sampling was employed to the recruit medical record of
      patients. This study used a data abstraction tool to extract the patients'
      relevant socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. The data were analysed
      using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25.0 software. Frequency
      tables and figures were used to present the findings of the study. Binary
      logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with
      cisplatin nephrotoxicity. RESULTS: The study showed a mean age of 52.09 +/- 10.44
      years. The prevalence rate of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in cervical cancer
      patients was 45%. Of these patients, 36% and 9% patients had grade 1 and 2
      nephrotoxicities, respectively. Comorbidities (crude odd's ratio (COR) = 3.05,
      95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-7.02, p = 0.011), hypertension (COR = 3.0, 95%
      CI = 1.1-7.8, p = 0.03), and more than three cycles of cisplatin treatment
      (adjusted odd's ratio = 4.5, 95% CI = 1.19-17.0, p = 0.027) were significant
      factors of nephrotoxicity. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cisplatin-induced
      nephrotoxicity among cervical cancer patients was high in the study setting.
      Comorbidities, number of cycles and types of comorbidities were significant
      factors associated with cisplatin nephrotoxicity.

PG  - 105-111
LID - 10.5603/NMR.a2022.0023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to compare the myocardial perfusion 
      imaging (MPI) with [99mTc]tetrofosmin stress - rest single-photon emission
      computer tomography (SPECT) of patients with epilepsy with matched control
      individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All 29 adult epileptic patients were receiving
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for epilepsy. Thirty-two individuals matched for
      gender and age consisted of the control group. MPIs SPECT were performed, and
      myocardial summed scores were obtained during stress (SSS) and rest (SRS) images.
      Abnormal MPI was considered when SSS was >/= 4. In addition, the difference (SDS)
      between SSS and SRS was also assessed, which represents a rate of reversibility
      after stress. RESULTS: Twenty of 29 (68.97%) patients with epilepsy had abnormal 
      MPI and 14/32 (43.75%) of the controls (p = 0.04). Among males, 18/23 patients
      and 11/25 controls had abnormal MPI (p = 0.01), with quite a significant
      difference for mean SSS between male patients and controls (p = 0.002).
      Furthermore, SDS comparison showed that irreversible abnormalities were more
      common in patients than in control individuals. A difference of inadequately
      compensated myocardial ischemia between patients treated with enzyme inducing
      AEDs and patients treated with valproic acid was also detected. CONCLUSIONS:
      Single-photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) may detect increased risk for 
      coronary artery disease and further cardiovascular events in patients with
      epilepsy. Our findings favor the conclusion that SPECT could be used for the
      early identification of cardiovascular comorbidity in epilepsy.

      - comparison of planar lymphoscintigraphy, spect and SPECT/CT.
PG  - 101-104
LID - 10.5603/NMR.a2022.0022 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping allows minimal invasive assessment 
      of lymph node status in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer (EC).
      Intraoperative detection of SLNs is based on the results obtained from
      preoperative nuclear medical images. The purpose of this study was to compare the
      data obtained from planar lymphoscintigraphy (PL), single-photon emission
      computed tomography (SPECT), and SPECT with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) for
      preoperative SLN detection in patients with EC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 
      44 images in 22 patients with early-stage EC (22 PL, 9 SPECT and 13 SPECT/CT)
      were analyzed. The scans were performed in the period 2018-2020 at the Institute 
      of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine in Skopje. Thirteen patients underwent PL
      and SPECT/CT and nine patients underwent PL and SPECT after cervical injection of
      4 mCi 99mTc-SENTI-SCINT on the day of surgery. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon
      Matched Pairs Test, and Spearman rank R coefficient were used for data analyses. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with mean age of 61.1 +/- 7.5 and body mass index
      (BMI) 34.62 +/- 6.4 kg/m2 were included in the study. In four patients (18.2%)
      SLN was not detected on PL. Detection rate on SPECT and SPECT/CT was 100%. The
      average number of detected SLN was 1.4 +/- 1.05, 2.2 +/- 1.1 small i, Cyrillic
      2.15 +/- 1.1 on PL, SPECT and SPECT/CT respectively. We found a statistically
      significant difference in the number of detected SLNs on PL vs SPECT/CT (p =
      0.0077). The most common SLN location on SPECT/CT was the right internal iliac
      followed by the left common iliac region. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the
      presented study indicate a higher diagnostic value of SPECT/CT in terms of SLN
      detection and exact anatomic localization as compared to planar
      lymphoscintigraphy (PL).

LID - 10.1177/08258597221119325 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): For patients with cancer, the emergence of acute palliative care
      units (APCU) may hold promise in curtailing hospital readmissions. The study aims
      to describe the characteristics of patients readmitted to an APCU. METHODS: This 
      retrospective study examined patients with cancer readmitted within 30 days to an
      APCU. Readmissions were further classified as either potentially preventable or
      non-preventable. RESULTS: Out of 734 discharges from July 1, 2014 to July 1,
      2015, 69 (9%) readmissions were identified and analyzed. For index admissions,
      median length of stay was five days, and one (1%) was discharged home with
      hospice care. For readmissions, median time from index admission to readmission
      was nine days, median length of stay was six days, three (4%) patients died, and 
      20 (30%) went home with hospice. Ten (14.5%) readmissions were deemed potentially
      preventable (95% CI 7.2-25.0%). Race/ethnicity-White/Black/Hispanic/Others-was
      60%, 10%, 20% and 10%, respectively, among potentially preventable readmissions
      and 76%, 22%, 2% and 0%, respectively, among potentially non-preventable
      readmissions (P = .012). Potentially preventable readmissions were more likely to
      have venous thromboembolism (40% vs. 12%, P = .046) and more reasons for
      readmission (median 2 vs. 1, P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with cancer
      readmitted to an APCU, one out of seven was potentially preventable and a far
      larger proportion was discharged with hospice care compared to the index
      admission. Recognition of disease course, meaningful goals of care discussions
      and timely transition to hospice care may reduce rehospitalization in this
      population.

TI  - Survival Outcomes and Predictors for Recurrence of Surgically Treated Brain
      Metastasis From Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
PG  - 172-182
LID - 10.14791/btrt.2022.0016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are numerous factors to consider in deciding whether to undergo
      surgical treatment for brain metastasis from lung cancer. Herein, we aimed to
      analyze the survival outcome and predictors of recurrence of surgically treated
      brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A total of 197
      patients with brain metastasis from NSCLC who underwent microsurgery were
      included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 114 (57.9%) male and 83 (42.1%)
      female patients with a median age of 59 years (range, 27-79) was included in this
      study. The median follow-up period was 22.7 (range, 1-126) months. The 1-year and
      2-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with brain metastasis secondary to
      NSCLC were 59% and 43%, respectively. The 6-month and 1-year progression-free
      survival (PFS) rates of local recurrence were 80% and 73%, respectively, whereas 
      those of distant recurrence were 84% and 63%, respectively. En-bloc resection of 
      tumor resulted in better PFS for local recurrence (1-year PFS: 79% vs. 62%,
      p=0.02). Ventricular opening and direct contact between the tumor and the
      subarachnoid space were not associated with distal recurrence and leptomeningeal 
      seeding. The difference in PFS of local recurrence according to adjuvant
      resection bed irradiation was not significant. Moreover, postoperative
      whole-brain irradiation did not show a significant difference in PFS of distant
      recurrence. In multivariate analysis, only en-bloc resection was a favorable
      prognostic factor for local recurrence. Contrastingly, multiple metastasis was a 
      poor prognostic factor for distant recurrence. CONCLUSION: En-bloc resection may 
      reduce local recurrence after surgical resection. Ventricular opening and contact
      between the tumor and subarachnoid space did not show a statistically significant
      result for distant recurrence and leptomeningeal seeding. Multiple metastasis was
      only meaningful factor for distant recurrence.

TI  - Hydroethanolic Extracts of Senna alata Leaves Possess Antimalarial Effects and

AB  - The current work investigated the chemical profile, antimalarial potential and
      capacity of hydroethanolic Senna alata extract (SAE) to reverse hematological and
      biochemical pertubation in Plasmodium berghei infected mice. Results of the
      phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics,
      tannins, terpenoids, saponins, steroids and cardiac glycosides. Total phenolic
      and flavonoid content was estimated to be 45.29 +/- 2.34 mg GAE/g and 25.22 +/-
      2.26 mg QE/g respectively. In vitro analysis of the extract also confirmed its
      antioxidant property. Results of the test for prophylaxis of P. berghei indicated
      that SAE suppressed parasitemia significantly in treated groups in a dose
      dependent manner when compared with negative control group. Similarly, SAE
      improved the mean survival time (MST) and packed cell volume (PCV) of infected
      mice. The test for curative effect showed that SAE significantly suppressed
      parasitemia to 4.50 +/- 1.05% compared to untreated group 29.83 +/- 3.49%.
      Results of liver and kidney functions indices of treated animals indicated that
      whereas infection with P. berghei caused increase in the levels of AST, ALT, ALP,
      urea and creatinine, treatment with SAE significantly reversed the perturbation. 
      Similarly, infected mice were dyslipidemic with concomitant increased activity of
      HMG CoA reductase and decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes with increase in 
      lipid peroxides levels. However, these alterations were significantly reversed by
      administration of SAE. Results of this study shows that Senna alata possess
      antimalarial activity and therefore justify the traditional use of plant for the 
      treatment of malaria.

TI  - Concomitant ankylosing spondylitis can increase the risk of biologics or small
      molecule therapies to control inflammatory bowel disease.
LID - 10.5217/ir.2022.00057 [doi]
AB  - Background/Aims: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are diagnosed
      with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) often. However, the disease course of patients
      with both IBD and AS is not well understood. This study aims to evaluate the
      effect of concomitant AS on IBD outcomes. Methods: Among the 4,722 patients with 
      IBD who were treated in 3 academic hospitals from 2004 to 2021, 55 were also
      diagnosed with AS (IBD-AS group). Based on patients' electronic medical records, 
      the outcomes of IBD in IBD-AS group and IBD group without AS (IBD-only group)
      were appraised. Results: The proportion of patients treated with biologics or
      small molecule therapies was significantly higher in IBD-AS group than the
      proportion in IBD-only group (27.3% vs. 12.7%, P= 0.036). Patients with both
      ulcerative colitis and AS had a significantly higher risk of biologics or small
      molecule therapies than patients with only ulcerative colitis (P< 0.001). For
      univariable logistic regression, biologics or small molecule therapies were
      associated with concomitant AS (odds ratio, 4.099; 95% confidence interval,
      1.863-9.021; P< 0.001) and Crohn's disease (odds ratio, 3.552; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.590-7.934; P= 0.002). Conclusions: Concomitant AS is associated with 
      the high possibility of biologics or small molecule therapies for IBD. IBD
      patients who also had AS may need more careful examination and active treatment
      to alleviate the severity of IBD.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: does 
      anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha use protect from chronic inflammation-induced
      atherosclerosis?
LID - 10.5217/ir.2022.00017 [doi]
AB  - Background/Aims: Abdominal aortic calcium (AAC) deposition has been suggested as 
      a marker of early atherosclerosis. There is no published data on the evaluation
      of AAC in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: AAC was quantified by
      computed tomography or enterography scans performed in 98 IBD patients and 1:1
      age and sex matched controls. AAC deposition was correlated with IBD
      characteristics, disease activity or severity parameters, laboratory tests and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Results: Moderate-severe grade of AAC 
      was found in 35.7% of IBD patients compared to 30.6% of controls (P= 0.544). IBD 
      with CVD and ulcerative colitis patients had significantly higher rates of more
      severe atherosclerotic lesions (P= 0.001 and P= 0.01, respectively). AAC
      deposition was similarly distributed in age groups ( < 45, 45-64, and >/= 65
      years) among patients and controls. Multivariate analysis after excluding CVD
      risk confounders for non-CVD patients found extensive disease (P= 0.019) and
      lifetime steroids (P= 0.04) as independent risk factors for AAC. Anti-tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) use was negatively associated with AAC
      deposition in non-CVD IBD patients (odds ratio, 0.023; 95% confidence interval,
      0.001-0.594; P= 0.023). Conclusions: More than one-third of IBD patients have
      moderate to severe AAC. Better control of inflammation with anti-TNF-alpha agents
      seems to protect IBD patients from ACC deposition and subsequent atherosclerosis.

AB  - The effect of the UV-C treatment on the physico-chemical characteristics, pectin 
      methylesterase activity (PME) as well as microbial quality of orange juice,
      compared to fresh juice, was studied. The juice samples were UV-C (254 nm)
      irradiated for different exposure times (15, 30, 45 and 60 min) and stored at 4
      +/- 1 degrees C for 30 days. UV-C treatment didn't significantly (p </= 0.05)
      affect pH values, titratable acidity, TSS (%), ascorbic acid content and PME
      activity in both fresh and stored samples. Increasing the exposure time from 5 to
      60 min. showed no significant effect (p </= 0.05) on L* and a* values for both
      the fresh and the stored samples. On the contrary, negative relationship was
      observed between UV-C exposure time and b* values. Total bacterial counts were
      significantly (p </= 0.05) reduced from 2.69 to 0.93 log10 CFU ml(-1) when the
      exposure time was increased from 0 to 60 min. The UV-C treatment showed similar
      trend on yeast and mold counts but to a lesser extend due to their resistance to 
      UV. The sensory characteristics, i.e. odour, colour, taste, consistency and
      overall acceptability didn't change (p </= 0.05) as a result of UV-C treatment at
      any tested exposure times.

TI  - Compression Elastography and Shear Wave Ultrasound Elastography for Measurement
      of Brain Elasticity in Full-Term and Premature Neonates: A Prospective Study.
LID - 10.1002/jum.16075 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the brain tissue elasticity in normal term and
      premature neonates using compression elastography and shear wave elastography.
      METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled term and premature
      neonates admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical
      University between July 2019 and December 2020. RESULTS: A total of 106 neonates,
      including 65 premature neonates and 41 term neonates, were enrolled. The elastic 
      modulus of the frontal white matter in males was significantly lower than in
      females (11.67 +/- 0.98 versus 12.25 +/- 1.31, P = .030), but the shear wave
      velocity of the thalamus in males was significantly lower than in females (1.18
      +/- 0.13 versus 1.82 +/- 0.10, P < .001). There was no significant correlation
      between real-time body weight and brain tissue elasticity including elastic
      modulus and shear wave velocity. But, the shear wave velocity of parietal white
      matter (r = 0.319, P = .014) and thalamus (r = -0.268, P = .040) and the elastic 
      modulus of parietal white matter (r = 0.356, P = .006) were correlated with
      corrected gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians may consider using
      elastography to determine brain tissue elasticity in term and preterm neonates.

TI  - Increased phospho-AKT in blood cells from LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers.
LID - 10.1002/ana.26469 [doi]
AB  - To investigate whether differential phosphorylation states of blood markers can
      identify LRRK2 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, we assessed
      phospho(P)-Ser-935-LRRK2 and P-Ser-473-AKT levels in peripheral blood cells from 
      G2019S LRRK2-associated PD patients (L2PD, n=31), G2019S LRRK2 non-manifesting
      carriers (L2NMC, n=26), idiopathic PD (iPD, n=25), and controls (n=40) (total
      n=122). We found no differences at P-Ser-935-LRRK2 between groups but detected a 
      specific increase of P-Ser-473-AKT levels in all G2019S carriers, either L2PD or 
      L2NMC, absent in iPD. Although insensitive to LRRK2 inhibition, our study
      identifies P-Ser-473-AKT as an endogenous candidate biomarker for peripheral
      inflammation in G2019S carriers using accessible blood cells. This article is

TI  - Altered muscle oxidative phenotype impairs exercise tolerance but does not
      improve after exercise training in multiple sclerosis.
LID - 10.1002/jcsm.13050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience reduced exercise
      tolerance that substantially reduces quality of life. The mechanisms underpinning
      exercise intolerance in MS are not fully clear. This study aimed to determine the
      contributions of the cardiopulmonary system and peripheral muscle in MS-induced
      exercise intolerance before and after exercise training. METHODS: Twenty-three
      patients with MS (13 women) and 20 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls
      (13 women) performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Muscle fibre type
      composition, size, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, capillarity, and gene 
      expression and proteins related to mitochondrial density were determined in
      vastus lateralis muscle biopsies. Nine MS patients (five women) were re-examined 
      following a 12 week exercise training programme consisting of high-intensity
      cycling interval and resistance training. RESULTS: Patients with MS had lower
      maximal oxygen uptake compared with healthy controls (VO2peak , 25.0 +/- 8.5 vs. 
      35.7 +/- 6.4 mL/kg/min, P < 0.001). The lower gas exchange threshold (MS: 14.5
      +/- 5.5 vs. controls: 19.7 +/- 2.9 mL/kg/min, P = 0.01) and slope of VO2 versus
      work rate (MS: 9.5 +/- 1.7 vs. controls: 10.8 +/- 1.1 mL/min/W, P = 0.01)
      suggested an intramuscular contribution to exercise intolerance in patients with 
      MS. Muscle SDH activity was 22% lower in MS (P = 0.004), and strongly correlated 
      with several indices of whole-body exercise capacity in MS patients (e.g. VO2peak
      , Spearman's rho = 0.81, P = 0.002), but not healthy controls (rho = 0.24, P =
      0.38). In addition, protein levels of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes I (-40%, P =
      0.047) and II (-45%, P = 0.026) were lower in MS patients versus controls. Muscle
      capillary/fibre ratio correlated with VO2peak in healthy controls (rho = 0.86, P 
      < 0.001) but not in MS (rho = 0.35, P = 0.22), and did not differ between groups 
      (1.41 +/- 0.30 vs. 1.47 +/- 0.38, P = 0.65). Expression of genes involved in
      mitochondrial function, such as PPARA, PPARG, and TFAM, was markedly reduced in
      muscle tissue samples of MS patients (all P < 0.05). No differences in muscle
      fibre type composition or size were observed between groups (all P > 0.05).
      VO2peak increased by 23% following exercise training in MS (P < 0.001); however, 
      no changes in muscle capillarity, SDH activity, gene or protein expression were
      observed (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle oxidative phenotype
      (mitochondrial complex I and II content, SDH activity) is lower in patients with 
      MS, contributing to reduced exercise tolerance. However, skeletal muscle
      mitochondria appeared resistant to the beneficial effects of exercise training,
      suggesting that other physiological systems, at least in part, drive the
      improvements in exercise capacity following exercise training in MS.

TI  - Major surgical postoperative complications and survival in breast cancer: Swedish
      population-based register study in 57 152 women.
LID - znac275 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bjs/znac275 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications may activate prometastatic systemic
      pathways through tissue damage, wound healing, infection, and inflammation.
      Postoperative complications are associated with inferior survival in several
      types of cancer. The aim was to determine the association between postoperative
      complications and survival in breast cancer. METHODS: This population-based
      cohort included women operated for T1-3 N0-3 M0 invasive breast cancer in Sweden 
      from 2008 to 2017. Only major surgical postoperative complications leading to
      readmission and/or reoperation within 30 days were considered. Main outcomes were
      overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Prospectively
      collected nationwide register data were used. Multivariable Cox models were
      adjusted for clinical and socioeconomic confounders and co-morbidity. RESULTS:
      Among 57 152 women, major surgical postoperative complications were registered
      for 1854 patients. Median follow-up was 6.22 (0.09-11.70) years. Overall, 9163
      patients died, and 3472 died from breast cancer. Major surgical postoperative
      complications were more common after mastectomy with or without immediate
      reconstruction (7.3 and 4.3 per cent respectively) than after breast-conserving
      surgery (2.3 per cent). Unadjusted 5-year OS and BCSS rates were 82.6 (95 per
      cent c.i. 80.8 to 84.5) and 92.1 (90.8 to 93.5) per cent respectively for women
      with a major surgical postoperative complication, and 88.8 (88.6 to 89.1) and
      95.0 (94.8 to 95.2) per cent for those without a complication (P < 0.001). After 
      adjustment, all-cause and breast cancer mortality rates remained higher after a
      major surgical postoperative complication (OS: HR 1.32, 95 per cent c.i. 1.15 to 
      1.51; BCSS: HR 1.31, 1.04 to 1.65). After stratification for type of breast
      surgery, this association remained significant only for women who had mastectomy 
      without reconstruction (OS: HR 1.41, 1.20 to 1.66; BCSS: HR 1.36, 1.03 to 1.79). 
      CONCLUSION: Major surgical postoperative complications are associated with
      inferior survival, especially after mastectomy. These results underline the
      importance of surgical de-escalation.

TI  - Phenotypes of Allergic Asthma: Does In-Vitro Allergy Testing Help Predict Asthma 
      Disease Severity?
PG  - 19458924221112316
LID - 10.1177/19458924221112316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergy and asthma are often diagnosed concomitantly. Patients with
      both diagnoses might need to have a more targeted approach to reduce the
      symptomatic burden and severity of disease. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to
      explore the relationship between specific allergen sensitization, and asthma
      diagnosis and severity with the hypothesis that patients who tested positive to a
      higher allergy class of response and to more allergens would be more likely to
      have severe asthma. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 1419 charts 
      that had a positive IgE allergy class blood test between 2014 and 2018. A total
      of 701 patients had one or more positive tests and a diagnosis of asthma. Patient
      demographics and pertinent variables including all clinic and ED visits, specific
      allergy and class of response, and information related to their asthma treatment 
      and severity were recorded. Logistic regression was used to analyze the
      likelihood of asthma diagnosis, concomitant diagnosis of asthma and allergic
      rhinitis, and measures of asthma severity. RESULTS: Higher class of response to
      cat dander 1.24 (1.09, 1.41), dog dander 1.29 (1.13, 1.47), lamb's quarter 1.35
      (1.06, 1.70), house dust 1.41 (1.11, 1.82), Cladosporium herbarum 1.35 (1.07,
      1.67) or cockroach 1.56 (1.00, 2.44) showed increased odds of hospitalizations.
      There was a statistically significant difference between the average number of
      classes for patients with and without asthma (P < .001), and those with and
      without steroids (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that positivity to cat
      dander, dog dander, some fungus, and house dust was associated with more severe
      asthma.

PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1017/ice.2022.187 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Investigation of the origin of a Serratia marcescens outbreak in a
      neonatal intensive care unit. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. SETTING: 
      Regional level 3 perinatal center in Germany. PATIENTS: This study included 4 S. 
      marcescens-positive and 19 S. marcescens-negative neonates treated between
      February 1 and February 26, 2019, in the neonatal intensive care unit. METHODS: A
      case-control study was performed to identify the source of the outbreak. The
      molecular investigation of S. marcescens isolates collected during the outbreak
      was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and next-generation
      sequencing. RESULTS: The retrospective case-control study showed a significant
      correlation (P < .0001) between S. marcensens infection or colonization and
      consumption of donor milk that had tested negative for pathogenic bacteria from a
      single breast milk donor. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and next-generation
      sequencing retrospectively confirmed an S. marcescens strain isolated from the
      breast milk of this donor as the possible origin of the initial outbreak. The
      outbreak was controlled by the implementation of an infection control bundle
      including a multidisciplinary infection control team, temporary nutrition of
      infants with formula only and/or their mother's own milk, repeated screening of
      all inpatients, strict coat and glove care, process observation, retraining of
      hand hygiene and continuous monitoring of environmental cleaning procedures.
      CONCLUSIONS: Low-level contaminated raw donor milk can be a source of infection
      and colonization of preterm infants with S. marcescens even if it tests negative 
      for bacteria.

TI  - Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Overshadowed by Traumatic and Degenerative Spinal
      Diseases: A New Assessment Proposal.
LID - 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.37051-21.3 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a rare disorder among the elderly,
      characterized by gait disorder, dementia, and urinary incontinence. Considering
      the rareness of NPH and a lot of other pathologies, such as Parkinson's disease, 
      lumbar spinal stenosis, and even aging cause similar symptoms, NPH is an
      underdiagnosed entity. However, the percentage of misdiagnosis is not given in
      the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, patients diagnosed with NPH 
      were retrospectively screened between 2015 and May 2019 in our clinical database 
      and Ste-P formula was applied. Example cases showed that some of the patients
      receive inaccurate medical and surgical treatments before being diagnosed with
      NPH. RESULTS: As a result of the study was seen that a few out of 29 patients
      confused dizziness with trunkal ataxia or imbalance due to gait abnormality. As
      the time between onset of complaints and diagnosis increased, the value
      approached "zero", and diagnosis became difficult. CONCLUSION: Every unnecessary 
      operation carries serious risks that may threaten the life of the patient and
      decrease the quality of life. These surgeries and instrumentation materials used 
      may also result to additional financial cost. Similarly, long-term use of
      Parkinson's and dementia medications has a serious economical burden on the
      insurance systems and is detrimental to the patient's health. Considering all
      these diagnoses and physiological conditions that can be easily confused with
      each other, we recommend in this article a new formula to reduce the possibility 
      of misdiagnosis and treatment in patients with walking disorder.

      Prognosis of Acute Intracranial LargeArtery Occlusion Patients.
LID - 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.37008-21.2 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aims to explore the effect of pathogenesis-based individualised
      thrombectomy on the clinical results and prognoses of acute intracranial
      large-artery occlusion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 151 patients were
      included in this prospective study and divided into the control group (stent
      thrombectomy, 53 cases), a direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT) group
      (52 cases) and the stent group (stent thrombectomy or a combination of stent
      thrombectomy and ADAPT, 46 cases) based on whether stent or ADAPT was used. We
      compared and analysed the patients' general information, the National Institutes 
      of Health Stroke Scale (NHISS) score at admission, the time between the end of
      arteriography and revascularisation, the number of thrombectomies, the modified
      Rankin scale (mRS) score at three months and complications in the three groups.
      RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the time between the end of
      arteriography and revascularisation in the ADAPT group was significantly reduced 
      (P 0.05), and the patency rate after one thrombectomy significantly increased (P 
      0.05). The positive prognosis rate was significantly increased in the stent and
      ADAPT groups compared with the control group (P 0.05). CONCLUSION: The
      application of the ADAPT technique in patients with embolism-induced cerebral
      infarction can reduce the time of revascularisation. The use of stents in
      patients with atherosclerosis-induced cerebral infarction can increase the
      patency rate after one thrombectomy.

TI  - Clinical Study of Dexmedetomidine in Combination with Butorphanol for the
      Treatment of Postoperative Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
LID - 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.36585-21.2 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a severe disease with very high mortality,
      and most TBI patients are young adults. In the present study, we aimed to explore
      whether the combination regimen of dexmedetomidine (Dex) and butorphanol (But)
      could benefit patients with TBI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 208 TBI
      patients admitted from February 2018 to January 2020 were randomly divided into
      four groups as follows: control group (A), Dex group (B), But group (C), and
      combination of Dex and But group (D). Statistical analysis was performed to
      assess the changes in vital signs, oxygen saturation, serum neuroendocrine data, 
      pain, and agitation scores. RESULTS: The statistical data of vital signs and
      blood oxygen saturation of the four groups were compared, and the differences
      between group A and group D were statistically significant (P 0.05), indicating
      that a combination of sedative and analgesic agents at low doses could improve
      the vital signs of TBI patients, and the safety was relatively good. The scores
      of pain and agitation in the combination group were significantly improved on
      days 3 and 5, suggesting that the combination group was better compared with the 
      control group. CONCLUSION: The combination of Dex and But was more suitable for
      the treatment of vital signs. Compared with the individual treatment groups, the 
      patients in the combination group had a rapid improvement. Collectively, the
      combination of Dex and But could significantly benefit the prognosis of TBI.

TI  - Antioxidant and Neuroprotective Effects of L-arginine Administration After
      Traumatic Brain Injury and Hemorrhagic Shock in Rats.
LID - 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.35263-21.2 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of fluid
      resuscitation and L-arginine administration on oxidant status markers, blood
      gases, lactate and apoptosis in the brain tissue of a rat model of TBI with
      hemorrhagic shock. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 60 rats were divided into six
      groups: control, isotonic saline-treated, 7.5% NaCl-treated (hypertonic saline), 
      L-arginine-treated (100 mg/kg), saline + L-arginine-treated and 7.5% NaCl +
      L-arginine-treated groups. Closed head contusive weight-drop injuries were
      performed with hemorrhagic shock in all of the groups. Mean arterial pressure
      (MAP), pulse rate, lactate, malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity
      (TAC) and apoptosis were investigated. RESULTS: In a total of 48 rats, MAP levels
      remained higher than 60 mmHg for 3 hours in all of the treatment groups. The
      highest MAP values in each group were recorded. Higher MDA and lower TAC levels
      were observed in the control group than in all of the treatment groups (all p
      0.05). The number of apoptotic cells was highest in the control group and lowest 
      in the L-arginine group. CONCLUSION: L-arginine administration may be an
      alternative treatment option for individualized fluid resuscitation in patients
      with TBI and hemorrhagic shock.

TI  - The Morphology and Morphometry of the Human Interthalamic Adhesion Using
      Cadaveric Brains and Magnetic Resonance Images and Their Clinical Significance.
LID - 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.36551-21.2 [doi]
AB  - AIM: An interthalamic adhesion (ITA) is a midplane rod-like neuroanatomical mass 
      connecting two thalami over the cavity of the third ventricle. It is present in
      approximately 70-80% of healthy humans. The absence of an ITA has been considered
      as a midline defect of the brain associated with schizophrenia. The aim of the
      present study was to determine the prevalence, location, and dimensions of ITAs
      in Indian brains. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 100 brains (50 cadaveric and 
      50 MR images) in the midsagittal plane for the presence or absence of ITAs, their
      location in the lateral wall of the third ventricle, and dimensions. RESULTS: ITA
      found in 87 brains (87%), four showed duplication (4%). Both its duplication and 
      absence were more frequent among male. It was most commonly located in the
      anterosuperior quadrant with posterosuperior extension. The mean of horizontal
      diameter (7.13+/-4.31 mm) was longer than the vertical (5.13 +/-3.17) in all the 
      brains. Its average area (37.98+/-41.47 mm2) showed huge variation (ranges
      between 4.40 mm2 to 203 mm2) and was significantly higher in females
      (61.23+/-56.22 mm2) than males (36.44+/-43.21 mm2) (p = 0.026). No correlation
      was found between the surface area of the ITA and the length of the third
      ventricle. CONCLUSION: Absence and duplication of ITA are fairly common in Indian
      brains with significant male predominance. Morphometric data are robust to
      advocate for the presence of sex differences in the ITA size, although not
      associated with surrounding thalamic or third ventricle anatomy.

      Epidural Steroid Injection on Radicular Neck Pain.
LID - 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.36295-21.3 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined transforaminal anterior
      epidural steroid injection (TAESI) and dorsal root ganglion pulsed radiofrequency
      (DRG-PRF) therapy on the radicular neck pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The results
      of 84 patients with cervical radicular pain who underwent combined DRG-PRF and
      TAESI under fluoroscopy were evaluated retrospectively. Primer outcome is the
      pain measurements of the patients before and after the procedure at the 1st, 3rd,
      and 6th months were evaluated with the Verbal Pain Scale (VPS). Our secondary
      outcome was the evaluation of patient satisfaction in the 1st, 3rd, and 6th
      months after the interventional treatment, and it was considered significant if
      it was evaluated as \"good\" above 50%. RESULTS: We found statistically
      significant decrease in the pain scores of the patients in the 1st, 3rd, and 6th 
      months compared to the pre-intervention (VPS 0) (p 0.001). After the procedure,
      the patients expressed their satisfaction level as 69.1% at the 1st month, 71.5% 
      at the 3rd month, and 72.6% at the 6th month as \"very good/good\". While the
      operation was mostly performed at the C5-6 level on both sides, it was seen that 
      61.9% of the operations were applied from the right side and 38.1% from the left 
      side. No adverse effects or fatal neurological complications were observed.
      CONCLUSION: Although the efficacy and complications of cervical TAESI and DRG-PRF
      treatment are controversial in the literature, we think that this combined
      treatment can provide effective pain palliation in experienced hands with
      appropriate patient selection, considering the profit-loss ratio.

LID - 10.12788/fp.0269 [doi]
AB  - Background: Black individuals and veterans are at higher risk for developing lung
      cancer compared with that of the general population. Evidence suggests the
      screening criteria have been too conservative for this population. Methods: This 
      study is a retrospective chart review examining the applicability of the 2013
      United States Preventive Services Task Force lung cancer screening guidelines in 
      a US Department of Veteran Affairs institution that served a a predominantly
      black population. Patients diagnosed with stage 1 or 2 lung cancer from 2005
      through 2017 were included and grouped by whether or not they met United States
      Preventive Services Task Force screening criteria. Results: There was a
      significantly higher proportion of Black patients in the study group that did not
      meet screening criteria (68% vs 54%, P = .04), highlighting the concern that this
      population was being underscreened with the 2013 guidelines. Conclusions: An
      individualized, risk-based screening model could be more effective at diagnosing 
      early-stage lung cancer and requires more investigation.

      With Polycythemia Vera.
PG  - S43-S46
LID - 10.12788/fp.0243 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patients with polycythemia vera (PV), a chronic myeloproliferative
      neoplasm, have a greater morbidity and mortality risk than the general
      population, largely due to a high incidence of thrombotic events. Observations:
      Two recently published retrospective analyses from Parasuraman and colleagues
      used Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data to replicate, in a real-world
      population, findings from the prospective, randomized Cytoreductive Therapy in
      Polycythemia Vera (CYTO-PV) study. In the CYTO-PV study, hematocrit (Hct) level
      and white blood cell (WBC) count were shown to be independently associated with
      thrombotic event risk in patients with PV. In the VHA analysis, patients with Hct
      levels < 45% were found to have a significantly lower rate of thrombotic events
      compared to those with levels >/= 45% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.61; P = .04). For WBC
      counts and thrombosis, patients with WBC >/= 8.5 x 10(9)/L were found to have a
      higher rate of thrombotic events compared to the reference cohort of WBC < 7 x
      10(9)/L (HR, 1.47; P < .01), and the rates were higher for those with WBC >/= 11 
      x 10(9)/L (HR 1.87; P < .001). Conclusions: The results from these analyses
      suggest the need for managing Hct appropriately to maintain levels < 45% and
      offer further support for the consideration of WBC counts in determining risk of 
      thrombotic events. Studies are needed to clearly establish an optimal WBC count
      to inform updates to treatment guidelines.

TI  - The "Alzheimer Village": Assessment of Alzheimer's disease representations in the
      general population: A cross sectional phone survey.
PG  - e12328
LID - 10.1002/trc2.12328 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: In most countries, the societal view of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is
      very negative. The initiatives that are part of the so-called "dementia-friendly 
      approach" aim not only at promoting well-being and dignity of persons suffering
      from AD but also improving the way they are regarded and their inclusion in
      society. Unfortunately, scarce research has been conducted to assess whether such
      goals can be achieved. In France, the experimental Alzheimer Village in Dax is
      designed as a dementia-friendly community. Due to the recent opening (2020) and
      the strong local media coverage of this project, a survey has been designed to
      determine whether the representations of AD have been impacted by such a project.
      Methods: The survey was conducted before and after the opening of the Alzheimer
      Village in the city of Dax (hosting the village) and surrounding areas, and in a 
      control city with similar socio-demographics. The analyses intend to compare
      different dimensions of the representations and attitudes toward AD in the
      general population. Results: A total of 423 persons living in the Alzheimer
      Village city (37.4% were men) and 415 persons living in the control city (40.2%
      were men) were interviewed, resulting in 838 complete questionnaires. The main
      results report significantly lower rating in the perception of loss of identity
      (beta = -0.57, P = .014) and in the feeling of disgust for persons with AD (beta 
      = -0.61, P = .008) in the city hosting the village after the opening of the
      Alzheimer Village. No significant changes were seen in the control city sample.
      Discussion: While societal representations of AD are very robust and difficult to
      change, this study suggests a modest but significant evolution of representations
      of AD in the surrounding areas of the Alzheimer Village. Highlights: The French
      Alzheimer Village is one of the very few ones in the world.This is the first
      study assessing the impact of an Alzheimer Village on disease
      representations.After the opening of the village, attitudes toward Alzheimer's
      disease have changed.

TI  - Effects of combined cognitive and physical intervention on enhancing cognition in
      older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 878025
LID - 10.3389/fnagi.2022.878025 [doi]
AB  - Background: Combined cognitive and physical intervention is commonly used as a
      non-pharmacological therapy to improve cognitive function in older adults, but it
      is uncertain whether combined intervention can produce stronger cognitive gains
      than either single cognitive or sham intervention. To address this uncertainty,
      we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of
      combined intervention on cognition in older adults with and without mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: We systematically searched eight databases
      for relevant articles published from inception to November 1, 2021. Randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) were used
      to compare the effects of the combined intervention with a single cognitive or
      sham intervention on cognition in older adults with and without MCI aged >/= 50
      years. We also searched Google Scholar, references of the included articles, and 
      relevant reviews. Two independent reviewers performed the article screening, data
      extraction, and bias assessment. GRADEpro was used to rate the strength of
      evidence, and RevMan software was used to perform the meta-analysis. Results:
      Seventeen studies were included in the analysis, comprising eight studies of
      cognitively healthy older adults and nine studies of older adults with MCI. The
      meta-analysis showed that the combined intervention significantly improved most
      cognitive functions and depression (SMD = 0.99, 95% CI 0.54-1.43, p < 0.0001) in 
      older adults compared to the control groups, but the intervention effects varied 
      by cognition domains. However, there was no statistically significant difference 
      in the maintenance between the combined and sham interventions (SMD = 1.34, 95%
      CI -0.58-3.27, p = 0.17). The subgroup analysis also showed that there was no
      statistical difference in the combined intervention to improve global cognition, 
      memory, attention, and executive function between cognitive healthy older adults 
      and older adults with MCI. Conclusions: Combined intervention improves cognitive 
      functions in older adults with and without MCI, especially in global cognition,
      memory, and executive function. However, there was no statistical difference in
      the efficacy of the combined intervention to improve cognition between cognitive 
      healthy older adults and older adults with MCI. Moreover, the maintenance of the 
      combined intervention remains unclear due to the limited follow-up data and high 
      heterogeneity. In the future, more stringent study designs with more follow-ups
      are needed further to explore the effects of combined intervention in older
      adults. Systematic review registration:

TI  - Cognitive impairment in the population-based ural very old study.
PG  - 912755
LID - 10.3389/fnagi.2022.912755 [doi]
AB  - Background: Despite its marked importance in public health, the prevalence of
      cognitive impairment (CI) and its associated factors have only rarely been
      examined in old populations in general or in Russia at all. Objective: To assess 
      CI prevalence and its determinants in a very elderly population in Russia.
      Materials and methods: The population-based Ural Very Old Study, conducted in
      rural and urban region in Bashkortostan/Russia, included 1,526 (81.1%) out of
      1,882 eligible individuals aged 85+ years. A series of medical examinations
      including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for the assessment of CI was
      performed. Results: Mini-Mental State Examination data were available for 1,442
      (94.5%) individuals (mean age: 88.3 +/- 2.9 years; range: 85-103 years). The
      median MMSE score was 24 (interquartile range: 19, 27). Prevalence of any CI
      (MMSE score < 24 points) was 701/1,442 [48.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI):
      46.0, 51.2]. Prevalence of mild, moderate and severe CI (MMSE score 19-23 points,
      10-18 points, and </=9 points, respectively) was 357/1,442 (24.8%; 95% CI: 22.5, 
      27.0), 246/1,442 (17.1%; 95% CI: 15.1, 19.0), and 98/1,442 (6.8%; 95% CI: 5.5,
      8.1), resp. A lower MMSE score correlated (regression coefficient r(2): 0.31)
      with older age (beta: -0.13; P < 0.001), rural region of habitation (beta: 0.15; 
      P < 0.001), lower level of education (beta: 0.19; P < 0.001), higher depression
      score (beta: -0.33; P < 0.001) (or alternatively, higher prevalence of hearing
      loss (beta: -0.10; P = 0.001), worse visual acuity (beta: -0.10; P = 0.001), and 
      lower physical activity (beta: 0.06; P = 0.04). Conclusion: In this elderly study
      population from rural and urban Russia, prevalence of any, mild, moderate and
      severe CI was 48.6, 24.8, 17.1, and 6.8%, resp. Besides medical and lifestyle
      factors, vision and hearing impairment were major factors associated with CI.

TI  - Direct H-He chemical association in superionic FeO2H2He at deep-Earth conditions.
PG  - nwab168
LID - 10.1093/nsr/nwab168 [doi]
AB  - Hydrogen and helium are known to play crucial roles in geological and
      astrophysical environments; however, they are inert toward each other across wide
      pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions. Given their prominent presence and
      influence on the formation and evolution of celestial bodies, it is of
      fundamental interest to explore the nature of interactions between hydrogen and
      helium. Using an advanced crystal structure search method, we have identified a
      quaternary compound FeO2H2He stabilized in a wide range of P-T conditions. Ab
      initio molecular dynamics simulations further reveal a novel superionic state of 
      FeO2H2He hosting liquid-like diffusive hydrogen in the FeO2He sublattice,
      creating a conducive environment for H-He chemical association, at P-T conditions
      corresponding to the Earth's lowest mantle regions. To our surprise, this
      chemically facilitated coalescence of otherwise immiscible molecular species
      highlights a promising avenue for exploring this long-sought but hitherto
      unattainable state of matter. This finding raises strong prospects for exotic
      H-He mixtures inside Earth and possibly also in other astronomical bodies.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Standardized Clinical Nutrition Diagnosis and
      Treatment Pathway in Patients with Pulmonary Infection.
PG  - 6706390
LID - 10.1155/2022/6706390 [doi]
AB  - Objective: From the perspective of economics, this study discusses the value of
      establishing a standardized clinical nutrition diagnosis and treatment pathway in
      the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary infection and provides a reference for
      optimizing the diagnosis and treatment pathway of pulmonary infection. Methods:
      The patients who received the nutrition diagnosis and treatment pathway
      intervention in 2017 were counted as the routine group and were subdivided into
      the conventional intervention group (C1) and conventional control group (C2)
      according to whether the standardized nutrition therapy was applied or not. The
      patients who received the nutrition diagnosis and treatment pathway intervention 
      in 2020 were counted as the experimental group and were subdivided into the
      experimental intervention group (T1) and the experimental control group (T2)
      according to whether standardized intervention was applied or not. The total
      hospitalization expenses, average daily hospitalization cost, nutrition support
      expenses, plasma albumin before and after nutrition support, readmission, and
      other indicators of all patients were recorded and compared. The
      cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and 
      cost-effectiveness threshold for cost-effectiveness analysis were adopted.
      Results: Compared with the C2 group, the C1 group had higher total
      hospitalization expenses, average daily hospitalization expenses, nutritional
      support expenses, and plasma albumin improvement rate and lower readmission rate 
      (P < 0.001). Compared with the T2 group, the T1 group had higher total
      hospitalization cost, average daily hospitalization expenses, nutritional support
      expenses, and plasma albumin improvement rate and lower readmission rate (P <
      0.001). Taking the improvement rate of plasma albumin as the effect index,
      compared with the C1 group, the T1 group has less investment cost and better
      effect, and the ICER is negative (below the cost-effect threshold). And taking
      the readmission rate as the effective index, compared with the C1 group, the T1
      group invested less cost and had a better effect, and the ICER was negative
      (below the cost-effect threshold). Conclusion: For the patients with pulmonary
      infection, whether the improvement rate of plasma albumin or the readmission rate
      is used as the impact index, the standardized nutrition diagnosis and treatment
      pathway in 2020 is more economical than the nonstandardized nutrition diagnosis
      and treatment pathway.

AB  - To investigate the correlation between computed tomography (CT) image
      characteristics of multiple lung ground-glass nodules (GGNs) and pathological
      classification, the CT image data of multiple lung GGN patients confirmed by
      pathology (n = 132) in our hospital were collected. The imaging features of GGNs 
      were analyzed by qualified physicians, including lesion size (diameter, volume,
      and mass), location, CT values (mean and relative CT values), lesion morphology
      (round and irregular), marginal structure (pagination and burr), internal
      structure (bronchial inflation sign), and adjacent structure (pleural
      depression). CT imaging analysis was performed for the subtype of infiltrating
      adenocarcinoma (IAC). In CT findings, GGNs were greatly different from
      adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), pure GGN adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and
      microinvasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) in terms of marginal structure, lesion
      morphology, internal structure, adjacent structure, and size (P < 0.05). The mean
      and relative CT values of mural adenocarcinoma, acinar adenocarcinoma, and
      papillary adenocarcinoma of IAC subtypes were greatly different from those of
      AAH/AIS/MIA (P < 0.05). In summary, the CT images of GGNs can be used as the
      basis for the differentiation of AAH, AIS, and MIA early noninvasive types and
      IAC invasive types, and the CT value of the IAC subtype can be used as the basis 
      for the classification and differentiation of IAC pathological subtypes.

TI  - Effect of Optimized Emergency Care on Treatment Rate and Prognosis of Elderly
      Patients with Acute Stroke in Emergency Department: A Systematic Review and
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 5841978
LID - 10.1155/2022/5841978 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This research was to detect the treatment rate and prognosis of
      elderly patients with acute stroke in emergency department by the optimization of
      emergency care applying meta-analysis. Methods: The online databases including
      PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, China knowledge Network Database
      (CNKI), China VIP Database, Wanfang Database, and China Biomedical Literature
      Database (CBM) were searched. The retrieval time limit was set from the
      establishment of the database to the present. The data were extracted
      independently by two investigators. The bias of per publication was assessed
      following Cochrane manual 5.1.0 standard. RevMan5.4 statistical software was used
      to analyze the collected data by meta. Results: The 8 randomized controlled
      trials included in this meta-analysis all reported patients' baseline status. The
      meta-analysis of the rescue time of the study group and the control group (CH2 = 
      1507.80, df = 4, P </= 0.001, and I2 = 100%) showed that the emergency nursing
      with optimized emergency procedures can shorten the rescue of elderly acute
      stroke patients in the emergency department time. There are 6 literatures
      reporting the case fatality rate (Chi(2) = 1.12, df = 5, P = 0.95 > 0.05, and I2 
      = 0%), and the death rate of the study group was not higher than that of the
      control group (Z = 4.4 and P < 0.0001). The use of optimized first aid can reduce
      mortality in elderly patients with acute stroke. Six articles on disability rate 
      reported the heterogeneity of disability rate (CH2 = 2.88, df = 5, P = 0.72 >
      0.05, and I2 = 0%), indicating that the disability rate in the study group was
      lower than that in the control group (Z = 3.91 and P < 0.0001), indicating that
      emergency nursing by optimizing emergency procedures can reduce the disability
      rate of elderly stroke patients in emergency department. Conclusion: Optimizing
      the emergency care process can effectively improve the emergency rate and
      prognosis of elderly patients with acute stroke in emergency department; however,
      further research with higher methodological quality and longer intervention time 
      are needed to verify later.

      Ventilation in the Treatment of COPD with Type II Respiratory Failure: A
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 3835545
LID - 10.1155/2022/3835545 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To compare the safety and efficacy of transnasal high-flow oxygen
      therapy (HFNT) and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) in the
      treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with type II
      respiratory failure. Methods: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, CBM, CNKI,
      and other databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTS) on the 
      efficacy of HFNT and NIV in the treatment of COPD. Meta-analysis was conducted
      using RevMan 5.3 software after two researchers screened literatures, extracted
      data, and evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies according 
      to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: A total of 948 patients were
      included in 12 RCTS. Comprehensive analysis results showed that the HFNC group
      had higher levels of 12 h-PAO2, 48 h-PACO2 and, 48 h-pH than the NIV group, and
      the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). There were no
      significant differences in 24 h-PAO2 and 72 h-PAO2, 12 h-PACO2, 24 h-PACO2 and 72
      h-PACO2, 24 h-pH, 48 h-pH, and 72 h-pH between the two groups after treatment (P 
      > 0.05). Conclusions: Compared with NIV, HFNC does not increase the treatment
      failure rate in COPD patients with type II respiratory failure, and HFNC has
      better comfort and tolerance, which is a new potential respiratory support
      treatment for COPD patients with type II respiratory failure.

      Patients with Chronic Periodontitis: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 9349598
LID - 10.1155/2022/9349598 [doi]
AB  - Background: During the progression of chronic periodontitis (CP), changes in the 
      levels of inflammatory factors are detected in serum and gingival sulcus fluid
      (GCF). The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically evaluate the effect of
      periodontal treatment on GCF and serum proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6,
      TNF-alpha, and IL-8) in patients with CP. Methods: Literature searches were
      performed through PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database. Randomized controlled trials
      comparing cytokine levels in periodontal treatment (experimental group) and
      control group between 2015 and 2020 were included. Results: There were a total of
      13 studies included with 1220 patients. There were 630 cases in the experimental 
      group and 590 cases in the control group. The meta-analysis showed that IL-6
      levels in the GCF (SMD = -2.88, 95% CI (-3.68, -2.09), P < 0.001) and serum (SMD 
      = -1.27, 95% CI (-1.72, -0.81), P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the
      experimental group compared with those before treatment. In addition, IL-8 levels
      in the GCF (SMD = -2.08, 95% CI (-3.40, -0.76), P < 0.001) and serum (SMD =
      -1.73, 95% CI (-2.76, -0.70), P < 0.001) were decreased after periodontal
      treatment, but more than that, a decrease was observed in TNF-alpha levels of GCF
      (SMD = -3.98, 95% CI (-5.23, -2.73), P < 0.001) and serum (SMD = -1.80, 95% CI
      (-3.16, -0.45), P < 0.001) after treatment. Conclusion: After periodontal
      therapy, the proinflammatory cytokines in the GCF and serum of patients with CP
      were significantly decreased compared with those before treatment, and the
      efficacy was remarkable.

PG  - 2259373
LID - 10.1155/2022/2259373 [doi]
AB  - To analyze the application value of CT-enhanced scanning based on artificial
      intelligence algorithm in the diagnosis of gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma,
      the CT images of 80 patients with Borrmann type IV gastric cancer or primary
      gastric lymphoma diagnosed by endoscopic pathology were retrospectively
      collected. Meanwhile, a lymph node recognition algorithm based on OTSU threshold 
      segmentation was proposed for CT image processing. The results showed that the
      missed diagnosis rate of suspected lymph nodes and the missed lymph node
      detection rate of this algorithm were substantially lower than those of other
      algorithms (P < 0.05). The probability of gastric wall motility disappearance,
      perigastric fat infiltration, and type A enhancement pattern in the Borrmann type
      IV gastric cancer group was higher than that in the gastric lymphoma group, with 
      remarkable differences (P < 0.05). There was no remarkable difference between the
      Borrmann type IV gastric cancer group and the gastric lymphoma group in the
      probability of swollen lymph nodes under the renal hilum (P > 0.05). In addition,
      5the sensitivity (83.17%), specificity (95.52%), and accuracy (93.08%) of the
      combined detection of the three CT signs (stomach wall motility, perigastric fat 
      infiltration, and enhancement mode) were substantially improved compared with
      those of a single sign (P < 0.05). To sum up, the lymph node recognition
      algorithm based on OTSU threshold segmentation had better performance in
      detecting gastric lymph nodes than traditional algorithms. The CT image
      characteristics of gastric wall motility, perigastric fat infiltration, and
      enhancement pattern based on artificial intelligence algorithms were effective
      indicators for distinguishing gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma.

PG  - 1248577
LID - 10.1155/2022/1248577 [doi]
AB  - Background: There have been controversies about the preventive effect of low
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on venous thrombosis (VT) in the perinatal
      period. This study is aimed at exploring the effectiveness of LMWH in preventing 
      perinatal VT through meta-analysis. Methods: Databases such as CNKI, China
      Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc), Wanfang, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Central
      were searched. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) subjects: women at high
      risk of perinatal VT; (2) experimental group and control group; (3) intervention 
      measures: the experimental group was given LMWH, while the control group was
      given placebo or standard heparin or physical therapy; (4) outcomes: perinatal VT
      events or bleeding events; and (5) randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Jadad
      scale was used to evaluate the literature quality. The Mantel-Haenszel method was
      used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The
      chi-square test was used to analyze the heterogeneity of the included literature.
      Subgroup analysis was used to explore the source of heterogeneity. Publication
      bias was evaluated via funnel plot and Egger test. Results: The incidence of
      perinatal VT in the LMWH group was lower than that in the control group (OR =
      0.16, 95% CI (0.08, 0.32), P < 0.00001). There was no heterogeneity among
      literatures (P = 0.77, I (2) = 0%) and no publication bias. The incidence of
      postpartum VT in the LMWH group was lower than that in the control group (OR =
      0.14, 95% CI (0.07, 0.30), P < 0.00001). There was no heterogeneity among
      literatures (P = 0.69, I (2) = 0%) and no publication bias. The incidence of
      perinatal bleeding in the LMWH group was higher than in the control group (OR =
      1.72, 95% CI (1.06, 2.77), P = 0.03). There was no heterogeneity among
      literatures (P = 0.25, I (2) = 26%) and no publication bias. Conclusion: LMWH can
      reduce the incidence of perinatal VT in high-risk women but increase the risk of 
      bleeding. The use of LMWH to prevent perinatal VT should be closely monitored.

AB  - Background: Overexpression of miR-195 can make gastric cancer cells stay in G1/G2
      phase. miR-195 has been shown to inhibit gastric cancer cell replication and
      accelerate cell death by targeting JAK2. However, the relationship between
      miR-195, JAK2, and gastric cancer is not clear. Objective: To observe the effect 
      of mir-195 regulated by JAK2 on the growth, invasion, and death of gastric cancer
      cells. Methods: MGC803 and NCI gastric N87 cells were introduced into the
      negative control sequences of miR-195 and RNA, respectively. To detect the
      expression of miR-195 in cells, to detect the effect of miR-195 on mitosis and
      proliferation of tumor cells, to analyze the effect of miR-195 on cell invasion
      and metastasis, and to detect the regulation of miR-195 on JAK2 expression.
      Results: The level of miR-195 in miR-195-MIMICS group was significantly higher
      than that in miR-NC group. The cell survival rate of miR-195 mimic group was
      lower than that of miR-NC group (P < 0.05). Compared with miR-NC group, the
      number of cells in G1 phase increased, the cells in G2 phase and S phase
      decreased, and the proportion of cells in G2 and S phase decreased in miR-195
      mimic group. The scratch distance of miR-195 simulator group was larger than that
      of control group. The number of invasive cells in the miR-195 mimic group was
      significantly lower than that in the control group. The expression of JAK2
      protein in miR-195 mimic group was lower than that in miR-NC group. There was a
      significant negative correlation between the expression level of miR-195 and JAK2
      (rhabdomile 0.326 and record 0.00). There are continuous interaction fragments
      between JAK2 and miR-195. The luciferase activity of miR-195 mimic and wild type 
      JAK2 sequence expression vector was significantly lower than that of wild type
      JAK2 sequence expression vector. Conclusion: miR-195 may inhibit the occurrence, 
      metastasis, and invasion of gastric tumor by downregulating the expression of
      JAK2. miR-195/JAK2 may be a new molecular target for the treatment of
      gastrointestinal tumors.

TI  - Clinicopathological Significance, Related Molecular Changes and Tumor Immune
      Response Analysis of the Abnormal SWI/SNF Complex Subunit PBRM1 in Gastric
      Adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 1610479
LID - 10.3389/pore.2022.1610479 [doi]
AB  - Background: PBRM1 gene abnormalities were recently found to play a role in tumor 
      development and tumor immune activity. This article will explore the
      clinicopathological and molecular changes and tumor immune activity of the
      abnormal SWI/SNF complex subunit PBRM1 in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) and its
      significance. Methods: The cBioPortal, LinkedOmics and TISIDB datasets were used 
      to analyze the abnormality of the PBRM1 gene in GAC and its relationship with
      prognosis, related molecular changes and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
      In addition, 198 GAC cases were collected to further study the relationship
      between the loss/attenuation of PBRM1 expression and clinicopathology, prognosis,
      microsatellite stability, PD-L1 expression and TIL in GAC. DNA whole-exome
      sequencing was performed on 7 cases of gastric cancer with loss of PBRM1
      expression. Results: The cBioPortal data showed that PBRM1 deletion/mutation
      accounted for 7.32% of GAC and was significantly associated with several
      molecular changes, such as molecular subtypes of GAC. The LinkedOmics dataset
      showed that PBRM1 mutation and its promoter DNA methylation showed lower PBRM1
      mRNA expression, and PBRM1 mutation cases showed significantly higher mRNA
      expression of PD-L1 (CD274). TISIDB data showed that PBRM1 abnormalities were
      significantly positively associated with multiple TILs. In our group of 198
      cases, the loss/attenuation of PBRM1 expression was significantly positively
      correlated with intra-tumoral tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (iTILs) and
      deficient MMR and PD-L1 expression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that
      the overall survival of GAC patients with loss/attenuation of PBRM1 expression
      was significantly better (p = 0.023). iTIL was an independent prognostic factor
      of GAC. Loss of PBRM1 expression often co-occurs with mutations in other SWI/SNF 
      complex subunit genes, and there are some repetitive KEGG signaling changes.
      Conclusion: Abnormality of the PBRM1 gene may be related to the occurrence of
      some GACs and can affect tumor immune activity, thereby affecting
      clinicopathology and prognosis. It may be a potentially effective predictive
      marker for immunotherapy and a novel therapeutic approach associated with
      synthetic lethality.

TI  - Wood-Derived Vascular Patches Loaded With Rapamycin Inhibit Neointimal
      Hyperplasia.
PG  - 933505
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.933505 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patches are commonly used to close blood vessels after vascular
      surgery. Most currently used materials are either prosthetics or animal-derived; 
      although natural materials, such as a leaf, can be used as a patch, healing of
      these natural materials is not optimal; rhodamine and rapamycin have been used to
      show that coating patches with drugs allow drug delivery to inhibit neointimal
      hyperplasia that may improve patch healing. Wood is abundant, and its stiffness
      can be reduced with processing; however, whether wood can be used as a vascular
      patch is not established. We hypothesized that wood can be used as a vascular
      patch and thus may serve as a novel plant-based biocompatible material. Method:
      Male Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 6-8 weeks) were used as an inferior vena cava
      (IVC) patch venoplasty model. After softening, wood patches coated with rhodamine
      and rapamycin were implanted into the rat subcutaneous tissue, the abdominal
      cavity, or the IVC. Samples were explanted on day 14 for analysis. Result: Wood
      patches became soft after processing. Patches showed biocompatibility after
      implantation into the subcutaneous tissue or the abdominal cavity. After
      implantation into the IVC, the patches retained mechanical strength. There was a 
      significantly thinner neointima in wood patches coated with rapamycin than
      control patches (146.7 +/- 15.32 mum vs. 524.7 +/- 26.81 mum; p = 0.0001). There 
      were CD34 and nestin-positive cells throughout the patch, and neointimal
      endothelial cells were Eph-B4 and COUP-TFII-positive. There was a significantly
      smaller number of PCNA and alpha-actin dual-positive cells in the neointima (p = 
      0.0003), peri-patch area (p = 0.0198), and adventitia (p = 0.0004) in wood
      patches coated with rapamycin than control patches. Piezo1 was expressed in the
      neointima and peri-patch area, and there were decreased CD68 and piezo1
      dual-positive cells in wood patches coated with rapamycin compared to control
      patches. Conclusion: Wood can be used as a novel biomaterial that can be
      implanted as a vascular patch and also serve as a scaffold for drug delivery.
      Plant-derived materials may be an alternative to prosthetics or animal-based
      materials in vascular applications.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Personalized, Sex-Specific Prediction Algorithm
      of Severe Atheromatosis in Middle-Aged Asymptomatic Individuals: The ILERVAS
      Study.
PG  - 895917
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.895917 [doi]
AB  - Background: Although European guidelines recommend vascular ultrasound for the
      assessment of cardiovascular risk in low-to-moderate risk individuals, no
      algorithm properly identifies patients who could benefit from it. The aim of this
      study is to develop a sex-specific algorithm to identify those patients,
      especially women who are usually underdiagnosed. Methods: Clinical,
      anthropometrical, and biochemical data were combined with a 12-territory vascular
      ultrasound to predict severe atheromatosis (SA: >/= 3 territories with plaque). A
      Personalized Algorithm for Severe Atheromatosis Prediction (PASAP-ILERVAS) was
      obtained by machine learning. Models were trained in the ILERVAS cohort (n =
      8,330; 51% women) and validated in the control subpopulation of the NEFRONA
      cohort (n = 559; 47% women). Performance was compared to the Systematic COronary 
      Risk Evaluation (SCORE) model. Results: The PASAP-ILERVAS is a sex-specific,
      easy-to-interpret predictive model that stratifies individuals according to their
      risk of SA in low, intermediate, or high risk. New clinical predictors beyond
      traditional factors were uncovered. In low- and high-risk (L&H-risk) men, the net
      reclassification index (NRI) was 0.044 (95% CI: 0.020-0.068), and the integrated 
      discrimination index (IDI) was 0.038 (95% CI: 0.029-0.048) compared to the SCORE.
      In L&H-risk women, PASAP-ILERVAS showed a significant increase in the area under 
      the curve (AUC, 0.074 (95% CI: 0.062-0.087), p-value: < 0.001), an NRI of 0.193
      (95% CI: 0.162-0.224), and an IDI of 0.119 (95% CI: 0.109-0.129). Conclusion: The
      PASAP-ILERVAS improves SA prediction, especially in women. Thus, it could reduce 
      the number of unnecessary complementary explorations selecting patients for a
      further imaging study within the intermediate risk group, increasing
      cost-effectiveness and optimizing health resources. Clinical Trial Registration:

      fibrillation: A computational modeling study.
PG  - 942998
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.942998 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heritable disease, and the
      paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) gene is highly associated 
      with AF. We explored the differences in the circumferential pulmonary vein
      isolation (CPVI), which is the cornerstone procedure for AF catheter ablation,
      additional high dominant frequency (DF) site ablation, and antiarrhythmic drug
      (AAD) effects according to the patient genotype (wild-type and PITX2 (+/-)
      deficient) using computational modeling. Methods: We included 25 patients with AF
      (68% men, 59.8 +/- 9.8 years of age, 32% paroxysmal AF) who underwent AF catheter
      ablation to develop a realistic computational AF model. The ion currents for
      baseline AF and the amiodarone, dronedarone, and flecainide AADs according to the
      patient genotype (wild type and PITX2 (+/-) deficient) were defined by relevant
      publications. We tested the virtual CPVI (V-CPVI) with and without DF ablation
      (+/-DFA) and three virtual AADs (V-AADs, amiodarone, dronedarone, and flecainide)
      and evaluated the AF defragmentation rates (AF termination or changes to regular 
      atrial tachycardia (AT), DF, and maximal slope of the action potential duration
      restitution curves (Smax), which indicates the vulnerability of wave-breaks.
      Results: At the baseline AF, mean DF (p = 0.003), and Smax (p < 0.001) were
      significantly lower in PITX2 (+/-) deficient patients than wild-type patients. In
      the overall AF episodes, V-CPVI (+/-DFA) resulted in a higher AF defragmentation 
      relative to V-AADs (65 vs. 42%, p < 0.001) without changing the DF or Smax.
      Although a PITX2 (+/-) deficiency did not affect the AF defragmentation rate
      after the V-CPVI (+/-DFA), V-AADs had a higher AF defragmentation rate (p =
      0.014), lower DF (p < 0.001), and lower Smax (p = 0.001) in PITX2 (+/-) deficient
      AF than in wild-type patients. In the clinical setting, the PITX2 (+/-) genetic
      risk score did not affect the AF ablation rhythm outcome (Log-rank p = 0.273).
      Conclusion: Consistent with previous clinical studies, the V-CPVI had effective
      anti-AF effects regardless of the PITX2 genotype, whereas V-AADs exhibited more
      significant defragmentation or wave-dynamic change in the PITX2 (+/-) deficient
      patients.

AB  - Introduction: Disparities in the care and outcomes of peripheral artery disease
      (PAD) have been well-established. In part this is due to disparities in
      enrollment of PAD trial cohorts. However, less attention has been paid to
      non-random protocol non-adherence after enrollment, which may lead to inaccurate 
      estimates of treatment effects and reduce generalizability of study results. We
      aimed to ascertain characteristics associated with premature study drug
      discontinuation in a PAD cohort. Methods: Using data from EUCLID (Examining Use
      of Ticagrelor in Peripheral Artery Disease), factors associated with study drug
      discontinuation were assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox
      proportional hazards models with time to study drug discontinuation as the
      outcome of interest. Relationships between study drug discontinuation and major
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction,
      ischemic stroke), major adverse limb events (MALE; acute limb ischemia, major
      amputation, and lower extremity revascularization), and all-cause hospitalization
      were assessed. Results: Of 13,842 eligible EUCLID participants, 3,886 (28.1%)
      prematurely and permanently discontinued study drug over a maximum follow-up of
      42 months (annualized rate of 13.2 discontinuations per 100 patient-years). In a 
      multivariable model, premature study drug discontinuation was associated with
      older age (aHR 1.16, 95%CI 1.14-1.19), eligibility based on prior lower extremity
      revascularization rather than ABI/TBI criteria (aHR 1.14, 95%CI 1.06-1.23), CLI
      status (aHR 1.23, 95%CI 1.06-1.42), COPD (aHR 1.36, 95%CI 1.24-1.49), and
      geographic region. In a multivariable analysis, study drug discontinuation was
      significantly associated with MACE (aHR 3.27, 95%CI 2.90-3.67, p < 0.001), MALE
      (aHR 1.84, 95%CI 1.63-2.07, p < 0.001), and all-cause hospitalization (aHR 2.37, 
      95%CI 2.21-2.54) following study drug discontinuation. Conclusions: This analysis
      of EUCLID demonstrates that premature, permanent discontinuation of study drug is
      relatively common in more than a quarter of PAD patients, is unevenly distributed
      based on geography and other baseline characteristics, and is associated with
      worse outcomes in a clinical trial context. Study teams leading future PAD trials
      may want to address the possibility of study drug discontinuation prospectively, 
      as a proactive approach may help investigators to maintain study cohort diversity
      and representativeness without sacrificing power and precision.

      rupture after acute myocardial infarction: A single-center experience.
PG  - 933103
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.933103 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To analyze the survival and risk factors associated with the surgical 
      treatment of ventricular septal rupture (VSR) after acute myocardial infarction
      (AMI). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 45 consecutive patients with VSR
      after AMI whose procedures were performed in the Department of Cardiovascular
      Surgery at the General Hospital of Northern Theater Command between January 2012 
      and December 2021. Relevant clinical data, surgery-related conditions, and
      follow-up data of all patients were summarized. Patients were divided into the
      survival group and the death group. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test
      were used to determine the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality.
      Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent risk
      factors for all-cause mortality. Results: The average postoperative follow-up
      time was 42.1 +/- 34.1 months. The overall mortality rate was 20% (9/45 patients)
      and the operative mortality rate was 8.9% (4/45 patients). Logistic analysis
      showed that the death group had higher serum creatinine (127.32 +/- 47.82 vs.
      82.61 +/- 27.80 mumol/L, respectively; P = 0.0238) and N-terminal pro-B-type
      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) [8,654.00 pg/mL (6,197.00-11,949.00 pg/mL) vs.
      4,268.96 pg/mL (1,800.00-7,894.00 pg/mL), respectively; P = 0.0134] levels than
      the survival group. The cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB) was longer in the death
      group than in the survival group [131.00 min (121.00-184.00 min) vs. 119.00 min
      (103.00-151.50 min), respectively; P = 0.0454]. Significantly more red blood
      cells were transfused in the death group than in the survival group [11.60 units 
      (6.10-16.50) vs. 3.75 units (0.00-7.00 units), respectively; P = 0.0025].
      Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) implantation (P = 0.016) and ventilation time (P
      = 0.0022) were risk factors for mortality. A 1-month landmark analysis showed
      that compared with patients with VSR to surgical time >14 days, patients who
      underwent surgery within 14 days had a higher rate of all-cause mortality (25.00 
      vs. 3.33%; log-rank P = 0.023). Patients with VSR within 14 days also had a
      higher rate of residual shunts that were higher than moderate. Multivariate
      analysis showed that transfusion of red blood cells and NT-proBNP level were risk
      factors for all-cause mortality, as well as major adverse cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular events. Conclusions: Surgical repair resulted in good outcomes
      for patients with VSR after AMI. Patients with VSR to surgical time >14 days had 
      a lower rate of all-cause mortality. Treatment strategies for VSR should be based
      on the patient's condition and comprehensively determined through real-time
      evaluation and monitoring.

PG  - 948924

AB  - Background: Anti-Embolism (AE) devices therapy is an additional antithrombotic
      treatment that is effective in many venous diseases, but the correlations between
      this medical compression therapy and cardiovascular arterial disease or comorbid 
      diabetes mellitus (DM) are still controversial. In this study we investigated the
      association between compression therapy and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality
      in patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) diagnosis complicated 
      with type II DM. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed all patients
      with AMI and type II DM in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV
      database. We extracted the demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results,
      comorbidities, and scoring system results of patients from the first 24 h after
      ICU admission. The outcomes of this study were 28-day mortality and ICU
      mortality. Analyses included Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox
      proportional-hazards regression, and subgroup analysis. Results: The study
      included 985 eligible patients with AMI and type II DM, of who 293 and 692 were
      enrolled into the no-AE device therapy and AE device therapy groups,
      respectively. In the multivariate analysis, compared with no-AE device therapy,
      AE device therapy was a significant predictor of 28-day mortality (OR = 0.48, 95%
      CI = 0.24-0.96, P = 0.039) and ICU mortality (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.27-0.90, P = 
      0.021). In addition to age, gender and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery,
      there were no significant interactions of AE device therapy and other related
      risk factors with ICU mortality and 28-day mortality in the subgroup analysis.
      Conclusions: Simple-AE-device therapy was associated with reduced risks of ICU
      mortality and 28-day mortality, as well as an improvement in the benefit on
      in-hospital survival in patients with AMI complicated with type II DM.

AB  - Objective: This study was designed to analyze the expression of miR-155 in serum 
      exosomes in children with epilepsy and to explore its diagnostic value. Methods: 
      From March 2020 to March 2021, 43 hospitalized children with epilepsy admitted to
      the Department of Neurology of the hospital were included, and another 43 gender-
      and age-matched healthy children were randomly selected as the healthy control
      group during the same period. Then fasting serum samples of the two groups were
      collected to extract the exosomes. The morphology of the exosomes was evaluated
      under a transmission electron microscope, and the expression of specific protein 
      markers on the surface was detected by Western Blot. In addition, the relative
      expression of miR-155 in serum exosomes in children with epilepsy with different 
      courses of the disease and different degrees of abnormal electroencephalography
      (EEG) was compared, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
      (ROC) curve (ROC-AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of miR-155.
      Results: A higher relative expression level of miR-155 in serum exosomes was
      obtained in the epilepsy group, as compared to the healthy control group
      (P<0.05), and the relative expression of miR-155 in serum exosomes in children
      with epilepsy was correlated with the course of the disease and the degree of
      abnormal EEG (both P<0.05). In addition, the expression of miR-155 in serum
      exosomes showed high diagnostic efficiency for epilepsy (AUC = 0.813, P<0.05).
      Conclusion: The expression of miR-155 in serum exosomes in children with epilepsy
      is up-regulated, and its level is related to the course of the disease and the
      degree of abnormal EEG, so miR-155 in serum exosomes may be used as a biomarker
      for the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of epilepsy.

AB  - Background: The aim of the study was to find the potential roles of B-type
      natriuretic peptide (BNP) and imaging markers on distinguishing cardioembolic
      (CE) stroke from non-CE stroke, so as to provide useful information for making
      individualized endovascular treatment (EVT) plan for the patients with acute
      ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: The patients with unilateral anterior circulation
      large vessel occlusion who underwent EVT between March 2016 and December 2021
      were analyzed in this study, retrospectively. The risk factors, laboratory test
      indicators, imaging parameters, and other factors were compared between the CE
      group and non-CE group. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors 
      of CE stroke. ROC curves were used to assess the values of different parameters
      on distinguishing CE stroke from non-CE stroke. The relationships between BNP and
      imaging parameters were assessed using the Spearman correlation analysis.
      Results: 160 patients were enrolled in the study and divided into the CE group (n
      = 66) and non-CE group (n = 94). BNP (odds ratio (OR) = 1.004; 95% CI,
      1.001-1.009; p = 0.038), MMR (OR = 0.736; 95% CI, 0.573-0.945; p = 0.016), NIHSS 
      (OR = 1.150; 95% CI, 1.022-1.294; p = 0.020), and AF (OR = 556.968; 95% CI,
      51.739-5995.765; p < 0.001) were the independent predictive factors of CE stroke.
      The area under the curve (AUC) of BNP and mismatch ratio (MMR) were 0.846 (95% CI
      (0.780-0.898), p < 0.001) and 0.636 (95% CI (0.633-0.779), p < 0.001),
      respectively. The cut-off value of BNP was 249.23 pg/mL with the sensitivity of
      74.24% and the specificity of 82.98%. BNP combined with MMR improved the
      predictive value for CE stroke. The AUC of the combination was 0.858 with the
      sensitivity of 84.85% and the specificity of 73.40%. BNP was correlated with 4D
      CTA collateral score, MMR, clot burden score, final infarct volume, infarct core 
      volume, and ischemic penumbra volume (all, p < 0.05). Conclusion: BNP on
      admission combined with MMR is valuable for the risk prediction of CE stroke,
      which will promote the further screening of the high-risk patients with CE stroke
      and provide more diagnostic information for clinicians.

TI  - Chemotherapy Utilization in Men with Advanced Penile Cancer.
PG  - 12-15
LID - 10.1097/UPJ.0000000000000270 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Although studies using mixed insurance populations suggest that
      chemotherapy use in men with advanced penile cancer (PC) is low, it is unclear
      what regimens are being utilized. In this study, we use a database of insured
      patients to better understand specific chemotherapy utilization in men with PC.
      Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with stage IIIB or IV
      PC in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database
      (2004-2015). Standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy was defined by the National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network(R) guidelines: 4 cycles of paclitaxel, ifosfamide
      and cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil with cisplatin in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or
      primary setting. We calculated what proportion of patients receive SOC or any
      chemotherapy within 2 years of diagnosis and analyzed what factors were
      associated with receiving chemotherapy. Results: Our study included 147
      patients-48 stage IIIB and 99 stage IV. Of these patients, 49 (33%) received
      chemotherapy. Less than 5% of men received SOC. About 10% received SOC
      chemotherapy but an insufficient number of cycles. Married men were more likely
      to undergo chemotherapy (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5-7.8). Less than 5% of the 24 Black or
      Hispanic patients received chemotherapy compared to 37% of white patients (p
      <0.001). Conclusions: Only a third of men with stage IIIB/IV PC underwent
      chemotherapy. Less than 5% of men received complete guideline-based regimens.
      Whether this is driven primarily by patient or provider factors is unknown,
      although social determinants of health may play a role. These data highlight the 
      difficulty for patients with PC to get chemotherapy.

TI  - Dapagliflozin Improves Diabetic Cardiomyopathy by Modulating the Akt/mTOR
      Signaling Pathway.
PG  - 9687345
LID - 10.1155/2022/9687345 [doi]
AB  - Background: Dapagliflozin can significantly improve heart failure, and Cx43 is
      one of the molecular mechanisms of heart failure. This study investigated the
      effect of dapagliflozin on Cx43 and Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in ventricular
      myocytes. Methods: A rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus was established by
      high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin, and the animals were treated randomly
      with dapagliflozin. The morphological changes of the myocardium were observed by 
      hematoxylin eosin staining, and the expression and distribution of Cx43 in
      ventricular myocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry. And Western blot
      determined the expressions of Cx43, Akt, mTOR, p62, and LC3 proteins in rat
      myocardium. Results: Compared with the normal control group, the heart rate of
      diabetic rats decreased significantly (p < 0.05), QRS wave of ECG widened, and QT
      interval prolonged (p < 0.05). Dapagliflozin treatment in diabetic rats resulted 
      in improvements in these ECG indexes (p < 0.05) with early administration group
      obtaining greater efficacy than the late administration group (p < 0.05). In the 
      normal control group, the cardiomyocytes were arranged orderly, and the
      expression of Cx43 was dense, uniform, and regular, which was higher than that in
      the intercalated disc. In the diabetic control model group, the cardiomyocytes
      were enlarged and presented disorderly with detection of Cx43 in the cytoplasm.
      Early use of dapagliflozin better improved these myocardial tissue lesions. Of
      note, as diabetic rats exhibited decreased expression of Cx43, Akt, and mTOR (p <
      0.05), increased p62 expression (p < 0.05), and decreased LC3-II/I ratio (p <
      0.05), administration of dapagliflozin partially reversed the expression of the
      above proteins (p < 0.05) with greater improvement in the early administration
      group compared with the late administration group (p < 0.05). Conclusions:
      Dapagliflozin increases the expression of Cx43 in cardiomyocytes of diabetic rats
      and thereby alleviates heart failure partly through regulating the Akt/mTOR
      signaling pathway.

TI  - Duration of Acute Kidney Injury and In-Hospital Mortality in Elder Patients with 
      Severe COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 9929038
LID - 10.1155/2022/9929038 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who develop 
      acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) have extremely high
      rates of mortality. This study evaluated the prognostic impact of AKI duration on
      in-hospital mortality in elder patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective
      study of 126 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with severe or critical disease who
      treated in the ICU from February 4, 2020, to April 16, 2020. AKI was defined
      according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes serum creatinine (Scr) 
      criteria. AKI patients were divided into transient AKI and persistent AKI groups 
      based on whether Scr level returned to baseline within 48 h post-AKI. Results: In
      total, 107 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 70
      (64-78) years, and 69 (64.5%) patients were men. AKI occurred in 48 (44.9%)
      during their ICU stay. Of these, 11 (22.9%) had transient AKI, and 37 (77.9%) had
      persistent AKI. In-hospital mortality was 18.6% (n = 11) for patients without
      AKI, 72.7% (n = 8) for patients with transient AKI, and 86.5% (n = 32) for
      patients with persistent AKI (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed
      that patients with both transient AKI and persistent AKI had significantly higher
      death rates than those without AKI (log-rank P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox
      regression analysis revealed that transient and persistent AKI were an important 
      risk factor for in-hospital mortality in older patients with severe COVID-19 even
      after adjustment for variables (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.582; 95% CI: 1.025-6.505; P
      = 0.044; and HR = 6.974; 95% CI: 3.334-14.588; P < 0.001). Conclusions: AKI
      duration can be an important predictive parameter in elder patients suffering
      from COVID-19 and are admitted to ICU. Among these patients, those exhibiting
      persistent AKI have a lower in-hospital survival rate than those with transient
      AKI, emphasizing the importance of identifying an appropriate treatment window
      for early intervention.

TI  - Effect of Recombinant Netrin-1 Protein Combined with Peripheral Blood Mesenchymal
      Stem Cells on Angiogenesis in Rats with Arteriosclerosis Obliterans.
PG  - 3361605
LID - 10.1155/2022/3361605 [doi]
AB  - This work was aimed to explore the effect of recombinant netrin-1 protein and
      peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the angiogenesis ability of
      atherosclerosis. 28 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were taken as research models. The
      arterial occlusion models were created by surgery and then divided into the
      saline control group (n =7), netrin-1 treatment group (n =7), MSCs treatment
      group (n =7), and netrin-1 + MSCs combined treatment group (n =7). The peripheral
      blood MSCs were extracted from the peritoneal cavity of diseased SD rats and
      cultured alone or in combination with netrin-1. The individually cultured MSCs
      and netrin-1 were locally injected into the ischemic tissues of SD rats. The
      Tarlov scoring was performed at the first, second, and third week of treatment,
      respectively. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was
      also measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and 
      the capillary density was measured by immunofluorescence staining. The mean
      maximum contractility of the gastrocnemius muscle in each group was determined in
      the third week after treatment. The Tarlov score of the netrin-1 + MSCs group was
      significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05) at the second
      week. To the 4th week of treatment, the Tarlov score of the netrin-1 + MSCs group
      was highly increased compared to the netrin-1 group and the MSCs group (P <
      0.05). The expression of VEGF in the treatment groups was greatly increased each 
      week compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the netrin-1 and the
      MSCs groups, the VEGF was also notably increased in the netrin-1 + MSCs group (P 
      <0.05). The capillary densities of the treatment groups were observably greater
      than that of the control group in the second and third weeks (P <0.05), while the
      capillary density in the netrin-1 + MSCs group was also significantly increased
      than those in the netrin-1 group and the MSCs group (P < 0.05). The mean maximum 
      contractility of the netrin-1 + MSCs group was remarkably higher than that of the
      other groups (P < 0.05). The netrin-1 + MSCs group achieved the higher Tarlov
      score, higher VEGF expression, higher capillary density, and better muscle
      recovery than netrin-1 and MSCs treatments.

TI  - Implant Removal Due to Infection After Open Reduction and Internal Fixation:
      Trends and Predictors.
PG  - 514-524
LID - 10.22038/ABJS.2021.53838.2688 [doi]
AB  - Background: Implant removal due to infection is one of the major causes failure
      following open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The aim of this study was 
      to determine trends and predictors of infection-related implant removal following
      ORIF of extremities using a nationally representative database. Methods:
      Nationwide Inpatient Sample data from 2006 to 2017 was used to identify cases of 
      ORIF following upper and lower extremity fractures, as well as cases that
      underwent infection-related implant removal following ORIF. Multivariate analysis
      was performed to identify independent predictors of infection-related implant
      removal, controlling for patient demographics and comorbidities, hospital
      characteristics, site of fracture, and year. Results: For all ORIF procedures,
      the highest rate of implant removal due to infection was the phalanges/hand
      (5.61%), phalanges/foot (5.08%), and the radius/ulna (4.85%). Implant removal
      rates due to infection decreased in all fractures except radial/ulnar fractures. 
      Tarsal/metatarsal fractures (odds ratio (OR)=1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
      1.02-2.05), and tibial fractures (OR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.45-2.28) were identified as 
      independent predictors of infection-related implant removal. Male gender
      (OR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.49-1.87), Obesity (OR=1.85, 95% CI: 1.34-2.54), diabetes
      mellitus with chronic complications (OR=1.69, 95% CI: 1.13-2.54, P<0.05),
      deficiency anemia (OR=1.59, 95% CI: 1.14-2.22) were patient factors that were
      associated with increased infection-related removals. Removal of implant due to
      infection had a higher total charge associated with the episode of care (mean:
      $166,041) than non-infection related implant removal (mean: $133,110).
      Conclusion: Implant removal rates due to infection decreased in all fractures
      except radial/ulnar fractures. Diabetes, liver disease, and rheumatoid arthritis 
      were important predictors of infection-related implant removal. The study
      identified some risk factors for implant related infection following ORIF, such
      as diabetes, obesity, and anemia, that should be studied further to implement
      strategies to reduce rate of infection following ORIF.

TI  - Minimally Invasive Reconstruction of the Medial Collateral Ligament of the Knee.
PG  - 507-513
LID - 10.22038/ABJS.2021.53200.2643 [doi]
AB  - Background: This study describes a minimally invasive technique for the
      reconstruction of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and posterior oblique
      ligament (POL) through minimal incisions on the tibial and femoral sides of the
      ligament using the modified Bosworth technique. Methods: This study included 19
      consecutive patients who presented with chronic grade III injury; the mean age
      was 29.6 years (standard deviation +/- 7.5 years, range 19-43 years), and five
      patients (26.3%) had no associated injuries. Ten patients (52.6%) had associated 
      anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and four patients (21.1%) had associated 
      posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury. All patients were assessed 18 months
      postoperatively regarding functional outcome using the Lysholm score and medial
      joint space opening. Results: There was a statistically significant improvement
      in the patient functional outcome as the Lysholm score improved from 55.39 +/-
      6.9 to 89.42 +/- 6.4 at 18 months postoperatively. (P< 0.001). At the end of the 
      follow-up, 16 cases had grade 1 medial laxity, 3 cases with grade II laxity, and 
      no patients with grade III medial laxity. Conclusion: Minimally invasive MCL
      reconstruction with modified Bosworth technique gives very good results regarding
      the functional outcome and residual medial laxity of the knee.

TI  - Differentially Regulated Apolipoproteins and Lipid Profiles as Novel Biomarkers
      for Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy and Neovascular Age-Related Macular
      Degeneration.
PG  - 946327
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.946327 [doi]
AB  - Lipid dyshomeostasis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various retinal
      and choroidal vascular diseases. This study aims to investigate whether
      apolipoprotein (apo) mediated differential regulation of lipid metabolism
      contributes to the phenotypes of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) and
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). This study involved 148
      subjects including 53 patients with PCV, 44 patients with nAMD, and 51 age-,
      sex-matched subjects with normal fundus controls. Routine blood biochemistry
      profile was evaluated. Apolipoproteins was estimated by Luminex technology. After
      controlling for age, gender, body mass index, duration of hypertension and type 2
      diabetes mellitus, apoB/non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
      (p=0.015) was an independent risk factor for nAMD, apoB was an independent risk
      factor for PCV(p=0.011), compared with control. Low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) was significantly higher in patients with PCV when compared
      with nAMD (p=0.037). Furthermore, apoB/non-HDL, LDL-C, triglycerides and were
      significantly correlated with the pathogenesis of subgroups of PCV and nAMD. We
      concluded that lipid profiles and apos are differential regulated in PCV, nAMD
      and their subtypes, indicating different pathogenicity contributed to the
      different phenotypes of PCV and nAMD. Non-pachy PCV shares pathological
      similarities with nAMD, which is highly correlated with age-related
      atherosclerosis.

TI  - Short-time intensive insulin therapy upregulates 3 beta- and 17
      beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase levels in men with newly diagnosed T2DM.
PG  - 894743
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.894743 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Our previous study has found that short-term intensive insulin therapy
      in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased serum 
      testosterone levels, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Design and
      methods: In this self-controlled study, 43 men with newly diagnosed drug naive
      T2DM, aged 18-60 years, with HbA1c >9.0% were treated with continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) to normalize blood glucose within one week. 
      Venous blood specimens were collected for measuring of serum total testosterone, 
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), 3beta- and 17beta-hydroxysteroid
      dehydrogenase (3beta- and 17beta-HSD) concentrations before and after insulin
      therapy. Results: Testosterone increased from 13.0 (11.3, 14.6) nmol/L to 15.7
      (13.9, 17.5) nmol/L after intensive insulin therapy (p<0.001), while the levels
      of DHEA-S decreased significantly after treatment (from 6.5 (5.7, 7.3) mumol/L to
      6.0 (5.3, 6.7) mumol/L, p=0.001). The ratio of testosterone/DHEA-S increased
      significantly (2.4 (2.0, 2.8) vs. 3.1 (2.6, 3.7) nmol/mumol, p<0.001). After
      blood glucose normalization with the short-term CSII therapy, 3beta-HSD increased
      from 11.0 (9.5, 12.5) pg/mL to 14.6 (13.5, 15.7) pg/mL, p=0.001, and 17beta-HSD
      increased from 20.7 (16.3, 25.2) pg/mL to 28.2 (23.8, 32.5) pg/mL, p=0.009.
      Conclusions: Blood glucose normalization via short-term intensive insulin therapy
      increases plasma total testosterone levels in men with newly diagnosed type 2
      diabetes, associated with a decreased level of DHEA-S, probably because of the
      enhanced conversion from DHEA to testosterone catalyzed by 3beta-HSD and
      17beta-HSD.

TI  - Correlation Between Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis and Chest CT-Measured
      Erector Spinae Muscle Area: A Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 923200
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.923200 [doi]
AB  - Background: Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) plays an important part in diverse health 
      and disease states. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and computed
      tomography (CT) are available for its assessment. However, muscle mass assessed
      by BIA may be influenced by multiple factors. The erector spinae muscle area
      (ESA) on chest CT is recently presumed to be representative of SMM. This study
      aimed to derive BIA from the ESA and evaluate the magnitude of association
      (between ESA measured from chest CT) and BIA. Methods: Subjects hospitalized for 
      health checkups between December 2020 and December 2021, having undergone both
      BIA (50 kHz, 0.8 mA) and chest CT, were included. ESA was quantified at the level
      of the 12th thoracic vertebra (T12-ESA) by a standardized semi-automated
      segmentation algorithm. Low SMM was defined using the Asian Working Group for
      Sarcopenia criteria. The association between T12-ESA and BIA was then evaluated. 
      Stratified analyses by sex and BMI were also performed. Results: Among 606
      included subjects (59.7 +/- 16.6 years, 63.5% male), 110 (18.2%) had low SMM. BMI
      in low and normal SMM groups was 20.1 and 24.7 kg/m(2), respectively. Current
      smoking, drinking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic renal
      dysfunction were more frequently seen in the low SMM group than in the normal SMM
      group. The final regression model included T12-ESA, weight, BMI, and age, and had
      an adjusted R (2) of 0.806 with BIA. In the validation group, the correlation
      between T12-ESA-derived BIA and BIA remained high (Pearson correlation = 0.899). 
      Stratified analysis disclosed a stronger correlation between T12-ESA and BIA in
      male subjects than in female subjects (adjusted R (2) = 0.790 vs. adjusted R (2) 
      = 0.711, p < 0.05), and a better correlation was observed in obese (BMI >/= 30
      kg/m(2)) compared with underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2)) subjects (adjusted R (2
      =) 0.852 vs. adjusted R (2) = 0.723, p < 0.05). Additional analysis revealed a
      significant correlation between T12-ESA and skeletal muscle cross-sectional area 
      at the 3rd lumbar vertebra (L3-CSA) (adjusted R (2) = 0.935, p < 0.001).
      Conclusions: CT-based assessment of ESA at the T12 level is feasible and
      correlated well with BIA, especially in male subjects and obese subjects.

LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.935390 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aim: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely related 
      to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). A newly proposed definition is metabolic
      dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), which was changed from NAFLD.
      The clinical effect of this change on abnormalities of cardiac structure and
      function is yet unknown. We aimed to examine whether MAFLD is associated with
      left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) and cardiac remolding and
      further identify the impact of different subgroups and severity of MAFLD. Method:
      We evaluated 228 participants without known CVDs. Participants were categorized
      by the presence of MAFLD and the normal group. Then, patients with MAFLD were
      subclassified into three subgroups: MAFLD patients with diabetes (diabetes
      subgroup), overweight/obesity patients (overweight/obesity subgroup), and
      lean/normal-weight patients who had two metabolic risk abnormalities (lean
      metabolic dysfunction subgroup). Furthermore, the severity of hepatic steatosis
      was assessed by transient elastography (FibroScan((R))) with a controlled
      attenuation parameter (CAP), and patients with MAFLD were divided into normal,
      mild, moderate, and severe hepatic steatosis groups based on CAP value. Cardiac
      structure and function were examined by echocardiography. Results: LVDD was
      significantly more prevalent in the MAFLD group (24.6% vs. 60.8%, p < 0.001)
      compared to the normal group. The overweight subgroup and diabetes subgroup were 
      significantly associated with signs of cardiac remolding, including
      interventricular septum thickness, LV posterior wall thickness, left atrial
      diameter (all p < 0.05), relative wall thickness, and LV mass index (all p <
      0.05). Additionally, moderate-to-to severe steatosis patients had higher risks
      for LVDD and cardiac remolding (all p-values < 0.05). Conclusion: MAFLD was
      associated with LVDD and cardiac remolding, especially in patients with diabetes,
      overweight patients, and moderate-to-to severe steatosis patients. This study
      provides theoretical support for the precise prevention of cardiovascular
      dysfunction in patients with MAFLD.

PG  - 868298
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.868298 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Patients with neurodisabilities (NDS) are prone to alterations in
      body composition. Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is a condition characterized by
      increased adipose tissue accompanied by sarcopenia. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the prevalence of SO in patients with NDS, including stroke, spinal
      cord, and traumatic brain injuries. Methods: The study Sarcopenic Obesity in
      NeuroDisabled Subjects (acronym: SarcObeNDS) was a cross-sectional study of
      hospitalized patients (n = 82) and healthy controls (n = 32) with a mean age of
      60.00 +/- 14.22 years old. SO and sarcopenia were assessed through total body fat
      % (TBF %), fat mass index (fat mass to height(2): FMI = FM/h(2); kg/m(2)), and
      skeletal muscle index (appendicular skeletal muscle to height(2): SMI = ASM/h(2);
      kg/m(2)) via full-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This study was
      registered in the international database ClinicalTrials.gov with the unique
      identification number NCT03863379. Results: A statistically significant
      difference was found in SMI (7.18 +/- 0.95 vs. 6.00 +/- 1.13 kg/m(2), p < 0.001) 
      between controls and patients with NDS. No statistical significance was found for
      TBF (p = 0.783) and FMI (p = 0.143) between groups. The results remained the same
      after controlling the results for gender and BMI. A strong positive correlation
      was demonstrated between BMI and TBF for the total population (r = 0.616, p <
      0.001), the control group (r = 0.616, p < 0.001), and patients with NDS (r =
      0.728, p < 0.001). Conclusion: In summary, we observed significantly lower BMI
      and SMI scores in both genders compared to healthy controls. At the clinical
      level, a timely diagnosis and rapid treatment of sarcopenia and/or obesity in
      this population may prevent further metabolic repercussions accompanied by higher
      functional decline and lower quality of life.

TI  - The Relative Body Weight Gain From Early to Middle Life Adulthood Associated With
      Later Life Risk of Diabetes: A Nationwide Cohort Study.
PG  - 927067
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.927067 [doi]
AB  - Aim: To determine the effect of decade-based body weight gain from 20 to 50 years
      of age on later life diabetes risk. Methods: 35,611 non-diabetic participants
      aged >/= 50 years from a well-defined nationwide cohort were followed up for
      average of 3.6 years, with cardiovascular diseases and cancers at baseline were
      excluded. Body weight at 20, 30, 40, and 50 years was reported. The overall 30
      years and each 10-year weight gain were calculated from the early and middle
      life. Cox regression models were used to estimate risks of incident diabetes.
      Results: After 127,745.26 person-years of follow-up, 2,789 incident diabetes were
      identified (incidence rate, 2.18%) in 25,289 women (mean weight gain 20-50 years,
      7.60 kg) and 10,322 men (7.93 kg). Each 10-kg weight gain over the 30 years was
      significantly associated with a 39.7% increased risk of incident diabetes (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.47); weight gain from 20-30 years showed a more 
      prominent effect on the risk of developing diabetes before 60 years than that of 
      after 60 years (Hazard ratio, HR = 1.084, 95% CI [1.049-1.121], P <0.0001 vs.
      1.015 [0.975-1.056], P = 0.4643; P Interaction=0.0293). It showed a stable effect
      of the three 10-year intervals weight gain on risk of diabetes after 60 years
      (HR=1.055, 1.038, 1.043, respectively, all P < 0.0036). Conclusions: The early
      life weight gain showed a more prominent effect on developing diabetes before 60 
      years than after 60 years; however, each-decade weight gain from 20 to 50 years
      showed a similar effect on risk developing diabetes after 60 years.

AB  - Background: Glucose and lipid tolerance reportedly exhibit diurnal variations,
      being lower in the evening than in the morning. Therefore, the effects of
      exercise on glucose and blood lipid levels at different times of the day may
      differ. This study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term endurance
      exercise intervention in the morning versus late afternoon on 24-h blood glucose 
      variability and blood lipid levels. Methods: Twelve healthy young men
      participated in a randomized crossover trial. The participants were assigned to
      morning (09:00-11:00) or late afternoon (16:00-18:00) endurance exercise for a
      week, consisting of supervised exercise sessions on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
      Fridays. In the morning and evening trials, the participants walked for 60 min on
      a treadmill at approximately 60% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Following a
      2-week wash-out period, the participants performed the exercise training regimen 
      at another time point. Continuous glucose monitoring was used to evaluate blood
      glucose fluctuations during each 24-h trial period. Blood samples were collected 
      before and after each intervention to examine blood lipid and hormonal responses.
      Results: Examination of the area under the curve (AUC) of the glucose level
      changes for 24 h after the late afternoon versus morning exercise intervention
      revealed significantly lower values for the former versus the latter (P < 0.01). 
      The AUC of glucose level changes after each meal was also lower after the late
      afternoon versus morning intervention, and significantly lower values were
      observed in the late afternoon versus morning trial for breakfast and dinner (P <
      0.05, P < 0.01). In addition, a significant decrease in triglycerides (TG) and
      TG/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was noted after versus before the
      late afternoon intervention (P < 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that
      late afternoon endurance exercise is more effective than morning endurance
      exercise at improving 24-h glucose and triglyceride levels.

TI  - A Nomogram Based on Hematological Parameters and Clinicopathological
      Characteristics for Predicting Local-Regional Recurrence After Breast-Conserving 
      Therapy.
PG  - 861210
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.861210 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the factors for local-regional 
      recurrence (LRR) after breast-conserving therapy (BCT). We established a
      practical nomogram to predict the likelihood of LRR after BCT based on
      hematological parameters and clinicopathological features. Methods: A
      retrospective analysis was performed on 2,085 consecutive breast cancer patients 
      who received BCT in Shandong Cancer Hospital from 2006 to 2016, including 1,460
      patients in the training cohort and 625 patients in the validation cohort.
      Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed based on hematological
      parameters (fibrinogen, platelets, mean platelet volume, neutrophils, monocytes, 
      and lymphocytes) and clinicopathological characteristics to identify the
      independent factors for LRR. Subsequently, a nomogram for predicting LRR was
      established by logistic regression analysis. The nomogram was validated in 625
      patients in the validation cohort. Results: During the median follow-up period of
      66 months, 44 (3.01%) patients in the training cohort and 19 (3.04%) patients in 
      the validation cohort suffered from LRR. Multivariate analysis showed six
      independent factors related to LRR, including molecular subtype, pathological N
      stage, re-resection, radiotherapy or not, platelet count*MPV*fibrinogen (PMF),
      and neutrophil count/lymphocyte count ratio (NLR). Six variables were entered
      into logistic regression to establish the nomogram for predicting LRR. The
      nomogram of LRR showed excellent discrimination and prediction accuracy. The area
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.89 (p < 0.001, 95% 
      CI = 0.83, 0.95) in the training cohort and 0.88 (p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.8, 0.96) 
      in the validation cohort. Calibration curves for the prediction model in the
      training and validation cohorts both demonstrated satisfactory consistency
      between the nomogram-predicted and actual LRR. Conclusion: The combination of
      hematological parameters and clinicopathological characteristics can predict LRR 
      after BCT. The predictive nomogram based on preoperative and postoperative
      indicators of BCT might serve as a practical tool for individualized
      prognostication. More prospective studies should be performed to verify the
      model.

      Prognostic Factor in Bladder Cancer Patients After Radical Cystectomy.
PG  - 895413
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.895413 [doi]
AB  - Background: The effect of lymph node resection on the prognosis of bladder cancer
      (BLCA) patients receiving radical cystectomy should not be ignored. Our aim was
      to explore the prognostic value of the log odds of negative lymph nodes/T stage
      (LONT) and construct a more effective nomogram based on LONT to predict
      cancer-specific survival (CSS) in postoperative BLCA patients. Methods: Patients 
      diagnosed with BLCA after radical cystectomy between 2004 and 2015 in the
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were enrolled. We
      randomly split (7:3) these patients into the primary cohort and internal
      validation cohort. 86 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang
      University were collected as the external validation set. Univariate and
      multivariate cox regression analyses were carried out to seek prognostic factors 
      of postoperative BLCA patients. According to these significantly prognostic
      factors, a simple-to-use nomogram was established for predicting CSS. Their
      performances were evaluated by using calibration curves, the concordance index
      (C-index), the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and decision curve
      analysis (DCA). In addition, different risk groups were tested by Kaplan-Meier
      curves and log-rank tests. Result: Whether in cancer-specific survival (CSS) or
      overall survival (OS), LONT was an independent and significant prognostic factor.
      Through further screening, the ultimate nomogram of CSS was composed of nine
      independent prognostic factors including LONT, age, race, tumor size, histologic 
      type, T stage, N stage, summary stage and chemotherapy. The C-index of nomogram
      in the primary cohort, internal and external validation cohort were 0.734, 0.720 
      and 0.728, respectively. The AUC of predicting CSS at 3 and 5 years were 0.783
      and 0.774 in the primary cohort and 0.781 and 0.781 in the validation cohort. The
      results of calibration and DCA showed good concordance and clinical
      applicability. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were displayed in CSS among
      different risk groups. Conclusion: LONT was regarded as a novel and reliable
      prognostic factor. Compared with the AJCC staging system, the established
      nomogram based on LONT can more effectively predict the prognosis of BLCA
      patients after radical cystectomy.

      of Vitreoretinal Lymphoma.
PG  - 932674
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.932674 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To seek novel diagnostic approaches, we improved the workflow of
      cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing and evaluated its feasibility in vitreoretinal
      lymphoma (VRL) specimens; the profile of mutations was preliminarily analyzed for
      potential diagnostic value. Methods: The study was a diagnostic trial. 23 eyes of
      23 patients with VRL and 25 eyes of 25 patients with inflammatory eye diseases
      were enrolled. Approximate 500mul undiluted vitreous humor and 10ml diluted
      vitreous fluid was obtained through diagnostic vitrectomy and sent for
      cytopathological examinations. 500mul of the diluted vitreous fluid was spared
      for cfDNA sequencing. For cfDNA sequencing, DNA fragmentation procedure was added
      to the workflow to improve the extraction efficiency; mutations detected were
      analyzed for potential diagnostic model. The sensitivity and specificity of the
      cytopathology and cfDNA sequencing were compared. The clinical manifestations
      were preliminarily analyzed for potential correlations with the genotypes.
      Results: CfDNA sequencing was accomplished in 23 eyes with VRL and 20 eyes with
      inflammatory eye diseases. VRL-related mutated genes included MYD88 (18 eyes,
      78%), ETV6 (11 eyes, 48%), PIM1 (11 eyes,48%), BTG2 (7 eyes, 30%), IRF4 (7 eyes, 
      30%), CD79B (6 eyes, 26%), LRP1B (6 eyes, 26%), etc. Logistic regression based on
      the mutations of MYD88 and ETV6 was of the potential for the diagnosis of VRL
      (P<0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.789, sensitivity 0.913, specificity 0.950); by
      comparison, the sensitivity and specificity of the vitreous cytopathology were
      0.826 and 1.000, respectively. Further analysis of the mutation profile showed
      that patients carrying CD79B mutation tended to have higher intraocular
      interleukin-10 level (P=0.030), that CARD11 mutation was correlated with younger 
      age at ocular onset (P=0.039), and that patients with intracranial involvement
      carried more multiple-site mutations in the BTG2 gene (P=0.013). Conclusions: The
      improved workflow of CfDNA sequencing is of sound feasibility in a limited amount
      of vitreous humor. The logistic model based on the mutations could help to
      provide reliable clues for the diagnosis of VRL.

      single-center propensity score matching study.

AB  - Background: Indocyanine green fluorescence-guided laparoscopic hepatectomy
      (ICG-guided LH) is increasingly used for the treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). However, whether ICG-guided LH can improve surgical outcomes
      remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the short-term outcomes and
      survival outcomes of ICG-guided LH versus common laparoscopic hepatectomy (CLH)
      for HCC. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 104 ICG-guided LH and 
      158 CLH patients from 2014 to 2020 at our center. To avoid selection bias, 81
      ICG-guided LH and 81 CLH cases were analyzed after 1:1 propensity score matching 
      (PSM). The baseline data and results were compared between the two groups.
      Results: The baseline characteristics of both groups were comparable after
      matching. There was a significant difference in operative time: longer in the
      ICG-guided LH group than in the CLH group (p=0.004). However, there was no
      significant difference in operative time in anatomical resection between the two 
      groups (p=0.987). There was a significant difference in operative time in
      non-anatomical resection: longer in the ICG-guided LH group than in the CLH group
      (p=0.001). There were no significant differences in positive surgery margin,
      blood loss, blood transfusion rate, postoperative complication rate,
      postoperative length of hospital stay, mortality within 30 days, and mortality
      within 90 days. The ICG-guided LH group appeared to have a trend towards better
      overall survival (OS), but there was no significant difference in OS (P=0.168)
      and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P=0.322) between the two groups. Conclusions:
      Although ICG fluorescence-guided LH is a timelier procedure to perform, it is a
      safe and effective technique with the advantages of intraoperative positioning,
      low postoperative complication rates, and potential to improve OS.

TI  - The Role of Clonal Evolution on Progression, Blood Parameters, and Response to
      Therapy in Multiple Myeloma.
PG  - 919278
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.919278 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: A variety of biomarkers are considered for diagnosis (e.g.,
      beta2-microgobulin, albumin, or LDH) and prognosis [e.g., cytogenetic aberrations
      detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)] of multiple myeloma (MM). 
      More recently, clonal evolution has been established as key. Little is known on
      the clinical implications of clonal evolution. Methods: We performed in-depth
      analyses of 25 patients with newly diagnosed MM with respect to detailed clinical
      information analyzing blood samples collected at several time points during
      follow-up (median follow-up: 3.26 years since first diagnosis). We split our
      cohort into two subgroups: with and without new FISH clones developing in the
      course of disease. Results: Each subgroup showed a characteristic chromosomal
      profile. Forty-three percent of patients had evidence of appearing new clones.
      The patients with new clones showed an increased number of translocations
      affecting chromosomes 14 (78% vs. 33%; p = 0.0805) and 11, and alterations in
      chromosome 4 (amplifications and translocations). New clones, on the contrary,
      were characterized by alterations affecting chromosome 17. Subsequent to the
      development of the new clone, 6 out of 9 patients experienced disease progression
      compared to 3 out of 12 for patients without new clones. Duration of the therapy 
      applied for the longest time was significantly shorter within the group of
      patients developing new clones (median: 273 vs. 406.5 days; p = 0.0465).
      Discussion: We demonstrated that the development of new clones, carrying
      large-scale alterations, was associated with inferior disease course and shorter 
      response to therapy, possibly affecting progression-free survival and overall
      survival as well. Further studies evaluating larger cohorts are necessary for the
      validation of our results.

PG  - 934845
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.934845 [doi]
AB  - Background: Evidence suggests the role of changing traditional lifestyle
      patterns, such as Paleolithic, to the modern lifestyle in the incidence and
      epidemic of chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
      associations between the Paleolithic diet (PD) and the Paleolithic-like lifestyle
      and the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among an adult
      population. Materials and Methods: This case-control study was carried out among 
      206 patients with NAFLD and 306 healthy subjects aged >18 years. PD score was
      evaluated using a validated 168-item quantitative food frequency questionnaire.
      In addition, to calculate the Paleolithic-like lifestyle score, the components of
      physical activity, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status of the participants 
      were combined with the score of the PD. Results: The mean PD and Paleolithic-like
      lifestyle scores were 38.11 +/- 5.63 and 48.92 +/- 6.45, respectively. After
      adjustment for potential confounders, higher scores of adherence to the PD diet
      conferred a protection for the presence of NAFLD [odds ratio (OR): 0.53; 95%
      confidence interval (CI): 0.28-0.98; P for trend = 0.021]. Furthermore, PD and
      healthy lifestyle habits were negatively associated with NAFLD (OR = 0.42, 95% CI
      0.23-0.78; P for trend = 0.007). Conclusion: Our data suggest that the PD alone
      and in combination with lifestyle factors was associated with decreased risk of
      NAFLD in a significant manner in the overall population. However, prospective
      studies are needed to further investigate this association.

AB  - Background: At present, fish meal (FM) resources are in short supply, and
      competition for food between humans and animals is becoming increasingly
      critical. Finding non-grain protein sources that can replace FM is the key to
      solving the rapid development of aquaculture. Methods: Seven trial diets were
      prepared with 0 g/kg (EP0), 30 g/kg (EP3), 60 g/kg (EP6), 90 g/kg (EP9), 120 g/kg
      (EP12), 150 g/kg (EP15), and 180 g/kg (EP18) of enzyme-digested poultry
      by-product meal (EPBM) by replacing of FM. A total of 630 hybrid groupers
      (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus female symbol x E. lanceolatus male symbol) were
      equally portioned into 21 tanks. At 8:00 and 16:00 each day, groupers were fed
      until they were full for a cumulative period of 8 weeks. Results: The results
      showed that 30 g/kg of EPBM significantly increased the rates of weight gain and 
      special growth (P < 0.05). Significantly higher activities of serum glutamic
      pyruvic transaminase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, catalase, and superoxide
      dismutase were observed in the EP3 group (P < 0.05). The categories and numbers
      of the top 10 dominant bacteria in the phylum and genus levels were not
      significantly influenced by feed (P > 0.05). In the proximal intestine and distal
      intestine, there were significantly higher expressions of SNAT3, LAAT1, CAT2, and
      CAT1 in the EP3 group compared with the EP0 group (P < 0.05). In the EP3 group,
      the expressions of PepT1, LAAT1, B(0, +)AT, and CAT2 were significantly increased
      in MI than those in all other groups (except the EP0 group, P < 0.05).
      Conclusion: When FM was replaced by 30 g/kg of EPBM, growth performance,
      antioxidant capacity, and the ability to transport amino acids and peptides of
      hybrid grouper were significantly improved.

AB  - Autoclaving-cooling is a common starch modification method to increase the
      resistant starch (RS) content. The effect of this method varies depending on the 
      type of crop and treatment condition used. The objectives of this study were to
      verify the autoclaving-cooling treatment based on a meta-analysis result and to
      evaluate the physicochemical properties of modified starches. The meta-analysis
      study used 10 articles from a total of 1,293 that were retrieved using the PRISMA
      approach. Meta-analysis showed that the optimal treatments of autoclaving-cooling
      process that increase the RS content significantly, was in starch samples from
      the cereal group (corn, oats, rice) (SMD: 19.60; 95% CI: 9.56-29.64; p < 0.001), 
      with water ratio 1:4 (SMD: 13.69; 95% CI: 5.50-21.87; p < 0.001), using two
      cycles of autoclaving-cooling (SMD: 16.33; 95% CI: 6.98-25.67; p < 0.001) and 30 
      min of autoclaving heating (SMD: 12.97; 95% CI: 1.97-23.97; p < 0.001) at 121
      degrees C (SMD: 12.18; 95% CI: 1.88-22.47; p < 0.001). Verification using corn
      flour and corn starch showed a significant increase in RS contents from 15.84 to 
      27.78% and from 15.27 to 32.53%, respectively, and a significant decrease in
      starch digestibility from 67.02 to 35.74% and from 76.15 to 28.09%, respectively.
      Treated sample also showed the pasting profile that was stable under heating and 
      stirring.

TI  - Integrative analysis of the metabolome and transcriptome reveals the molecular
      mechanism of chlorogenic acid synthesis in peach fruit.
PG  - 961626
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.961626 [doi]
AB  - As the most abundant phenolic acid in peach fruit, chlorogenic acid (CGA) is an
      important entry point for the development of natural dietary supplements and
      functional foods. However, the metabolic and regulation mechanisms underlying its
      accumulation in peach fruits remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the
      composition and content of CGAs in mature fruits of 205 peach cultivars. In peach
      fruits, three forms of CGA (52.57%), neochlorogenic acid (NCGA, 47.13%), and
      cryptochlorogenic acid (CCGA, 0.30%) were identified. During the growth and
      development of peach fruits, the content of CGAs generally showed a trend of
      rising first and then decreasing. Notably, the contents of quinic acid, shikimic 
      acid, p-coumaroyl quinic acid, and caffeoyl shikimic acid all showed similar
      dynamic patterns to that of CGA, which might provide the precursor material basis
      for the accumulation of CGA in the later stage. Moreover, CGA, lignin, and
      anthocyanins might have a certain correlation and these compounds work together
      to maintain a dynamic balance. By the comparative transcriptome analysis, 8
      structural genes (Pp4CL, PpCYP98A, and PpHCT) and 15 regulatory genes (PpMYB,
      PpWRKY, PpERF, PpbHLH, and PpWD40) were initially screened as candidate genes of 
      CGA biosynthesis. Our findings preliminarily analyzed the metabolic and molecular
      regulation mechanisms of CGA biosynthesis in peach fruit, which provided a
      theoretical basis for developing high-CGA content peaches in future breeding
      programs.

TI  - Prevalence, correlates, and gender disparities related to eating disordered
      behaviors among health science students and healthcare practitioners in Lebanon: 
      Findings of a national cross sectional study.
PG  - 956310
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.956310 [doi]
AB  - Background: The raised prevalence of eating disorders (ED) amongst health science
      students and health professionals is of mounting concern. This study aims to
      determine the prevalence and correlates of eating disorders risk amongst a sample
      of Lebanese health science students and healthcare practitioners of both genders.
      Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled a convenient sample of 1,000
      participants (mean age: 23 +/- 5.4; females: 74.9%) from faculties of health
      sciences, clinics, pharmacies, and hospitals. The validated Eating Attitudes Test
      (EAT-26) was used to screen for eating disorders. Anthropometric data were
      self-reported by respondents to assess their nutritional status. Results: The
      risk of eating disorders was prevalent in 22.5% of participants. Females were at 
      higher risk of ED compared to males p = 0.03. Eating disorders risk did not
      differ between students and practitioners (p = 0.3). The highest proportion of
      high-risk participants were students studying nutrition and practitioners
      (40.9%), outracing their counterparts in nursing (18.7%), medicine (17.8%),
      pharmacy (17.7%), and midwifery (4.9%) sciences (p = 0.02). Most high-risk
      participants had normal body weight (60.4%), and 28.9% were overweight (p =
      0.001). Female gender, nutrition profession, and dieting were associated with
      increasing the odd of ED. Particularly, dieting increased the risk around five
      times. Further, each 3 participants over 10 were facing binge eating behavior.
      Conclusion: This study uncovers an undervalued profession-related-health-disorder
      in Lebanese health science students and healthcare practitioners. Specific
      attention should be given to EDs in professional educational programmes across
      healthcare disciplines.

TI  - Lip symmetry following rotation advancement cleft lip repair in 5-year-old
      children treated by Ralph Millard and Ron Pigott.
PG  - 145-154
LID - 10.1016/j.jpra.2022.05.012 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To compare the symmetry of the lip following Rotation-Advancement
      cleft lip repair by Millard and Pigott and to investigate the effect on the
      symmetry of cleft side and gender by using different surgical protocols. Symmetry
      following cleft surgery was compared to that of non-cleft children. Design:
      Retrospective study of photographs of children aged 5 years. Setting: Three
      decades of post-operative photographs of children treated by Millard and Pigott. 
      Patients: Eighty-nine children treated by Millard, 87 by Pigott and 91 non-cleft 
      children. Interventions: Photographs were assessed using the Symnose Computer
      program, a rapid semi-objective quantitative assessment of lip symmetry. Main
      Outcome Measures: Asymmetry score for each surgeon, and non-cleft children.
      Results: There was no significant difference in the median lip % mismatch score
      of Millard, 36.65% and Pigott, 38.52%. Right-sided clefts showed better symmetry 
      than left-sided clefts for Millard (p<.001). This was reversed for Pigott
      (P=.0121). There was a difference (P<.001) between the symmetry of the two cleft 
      cohorts and the non-cleft children (asymmetry 19.9%), and between Millard's
      outcomes following different lip surgical protocols (P < .0001), but no
      difference between Pigott's outcomes using different palate surgical protocols (P
      = 0.59). Conclusions: Cleft lip repair by Millard and Pigott resulted in similar 
      lip asymmetry (37% and 39% symmetry mismatch, respectively). Lip surgical
      protocol and cleft side may affect lip asymmetry. Palate surgery did not affect
      lip asymmetry. Following cleft surgery, children were more asymmetric than
      non-cleft children.

TI  - Evaluation of the National Institutes of Health-supported relative citation ratio
      among American orthopedic spine surgery faculty: A new bibliometric measure of
      scientific influence.
PG  - 100143
LID - 10.1016/j.xnsj.2022.100143 [doi]
AB  - Background: Publication metrics have been traditionally used to compare research 
      productivity amongst academic faculty. However, traditional bibliometrics lack
      field-normalization and are often biased towards time-dependent publication
      factors. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a new,
      field-normalized, article-level metric, known as the "relative citation ratio"
      (RCR), that can be used to make accurate self, departmental, and cross-specialty 
      comparisons of research productivity. This study evaluates the use of the RCR
      amongst academic orthopedic spine surgery faculty and analyzes physician factors 
      associated with RCR values. Methods: A retrospective data analysis was performed 
      using the iCite database for all fellowship trained orthopedic spine surgery
      (OSS) faculty associated with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
      Education (ACGME)-accredited orthopedic surgery residency program. Mean RCR,
      weighted RCR, and total publication count were compared by sex, career duration, 
      academic rank, and presence of additional degrees. A value of 1.0 is the
      NIH-funded field-normalized standard. Student t-tests were used for two-group
      analyses whereas the analysis of variance tests (ANOVA) was used for
      between-group comparisons of three or more subgroups. Statistical significance
      was achieved at P < 0.05. Results: A total of 502 academic OSS faculty members
      from 159 institutions were included in the analysis. Overall, OSS faculty were
      highly productive, with a median RCR of 1.62 (IQR 1.38-2.32) and a median
      weighted RCR of 68.98 (IQR 21.06-212.70). Advancing academic rank was associated 
      with weighted RCR, career longevity was associated with mean RCR score, and male 
      sex was associated with having increased mean and weighted RCR scores. All
      subgroups analyzed had an RCR value above 1.0. Conclusions: Academic orthopedic
      spine surgery faculty produce impactful research as evidenced by the high median 
      RCR relative to the standard value set by the NIH of 1.0. Our data can be used to
      evaluate research productivity in the orthopedic spine community.

TI  - Beyond GPS: Improved study of bicycling exposure through added use of video data.
PG  - 363-372
LID - 10.1016/j.jth.2016.11.006 [doi]
AB  - Bicycling has become increasingly popular in the United States in recent years
      for both recreation and utilitarian purposes. Yet, attributes of the bicycle
      riding experience and riding differences between adults and children and males
      and females are not well documented. Most existing data on bicycling trip
      characteristics are based on self-reported interviews or surveys, which are prone
      to recall bias. The purpose of this exploratory study was to capture naturalistic
      bicycling data to examine trip characteristics and compare exposure
      classification accuracy between GPS and video data. We enrolled 10 children and
      10 adults and captured their bicycling trips for one week each using PedalPortal,
      a GPS-enabled helmet camera data capture and coding system developed by the
      authors and a team of engineering students. Overall, 261 trips, 57 hours, and 670
      miles of bicycling were captured. The video data allowed for correct
      classification of riding location (sidewalk, bicycle lane, street, etc.), an
      advantage over GPS data alone. Child trips were significantly shorter in both
      time and distance than adult trips (p<0.01). The majority of male trips were
      commutes (69.8% child, 60.5% adult), while female trips were more evenly
      distributed among commute, non-commute utilitarian, and recreation. Adults
      primarily chose paved streets with no bicycle facilities, but also sought out
      on-road bicycle facilities (bike lanes and shared lane markings). Children rode
      most frequently on sidewalks. Results from this study demonstrate that the
      addition of video data can improve classification of bicycling exposure and
      differences by age and gender that can help planners and engineers better
      understand bicyclist behavior variations and increase safety by selecting
      appropriate and targeted countermeasures.

TI  - miR-29b-3p inhibits 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell proliferation through the
      YWHAE/BCL-2 regulatory axis.
PG  - 289
LID - 10.3892/ol.2022.13409 [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumours in the world
      and seriously affects health of men. Studies have shown that microRNA
      (miR)-29b-3p and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation
      protein epsilon (YWHAE) play important roles in influencing the proliferation and
      apoptosis of PCa cells. However, the molecular mechanism of miR-29b-3p and YWHAE 
      in the proliferation and apoptosis of PCa cells remains unclear. In the present
      study, bioinformatics as well as in vivo and in vitro experiments were used to
      predict and verify the targeting relationship between YWHAE and mir-29B-3p and
      investigate the potential roles of YWHAE and mir-29b-3p in the proliferation and 
      apoptosis of 22RV1 cells. Using bioinformatics and a double luciferase system
      assay, it was confirmed that miR-29b-3p can target YWHAE 3'untranslated region
      and affect the expression of YWHAE, suggesting that miR-29b-3p may be a potential
      miRNA of YWHAE. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, Cell Counting Kit-8,
      Transwell and cell scratch assays showed that miR-29b-3p significantly inhibited 
      the proliferation, invasion and migration of 22Rv1 cells (P<0.01). Rescue
      experiments demonstrated that YWHAE gene introduction reversed the inhibitory
      effect of miR-29b-3p on 22Rv1 cells. Western blotting revealed that the
      upregulation of miR-29b-3p inhibited YWHAE expression, resulting in a very
      significant decrease in the ratio of p-BAD/BAD and full-length caspase 3/cleaved 
      caspase 3 (P<0.01) and an extremely significant increase in the ratio of
      BAX/BCL-2 (P<0.01). A tumourigenesis test in nude mice in vivo confirmed that the
      upregulation of miR-29b-3p inhibited tumour growth by targeting YWHAE. The
      present experiments confirmed that miR-29b-3p plays a tumour suppressor role in
      22Rv1 PCa cells, and the YWHAE/BCL-2 regulatory axis plays a vital role in
      miR-29b-3p regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of 22Rv1 cells. These
      results may provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and targeted treatment 
      of PCa.

TI  - Healthcare Provider Engagement with a Novel Dashboard for Tracking Medication
      Ingestion: Impact on Treatment Decisions and Clinical Assessments for Adults with
      Schizophrenia.
PG  - 1521-1534
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S369123 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Schizophrenia is a severe, chronic condition accounting for
      disproportionate healthcare utilization. Antipsychotics can reduce relapse rates,
      but the characteristics of schizophrenia may hinder medication adherence. A phase
      3b open-label clinical trial used aripiprazole tablets with sensor (AS; includes 
      pills with ingestible event-marker, wearable sensor patches and smartphone
      application) in adults with schizophrenia. This post hoc analysis explored how
      healthcare providers' (HCPs) usage of a dashboard that provided medication
      ingestion information impacted treatment decisions and clinical assessments.
      Patients and Methods: Participants used AS for 3-6 months. HCPs were instructed
      to check the dashboard regularly, identify features used, and report impact on
      treatment decisions. After stratifying HCPs by frequency of dashboard checks and 
      resulting treatment decisions, changes from baseline were calculated for Positive
      and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity of
      Illness and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I), and Personal and Social Performance (PSP),
      and compared using Mann-Whitney U-tests and rank-biserial correlation coefficient
      (r) effect sizes. Results: To ensure sufficient opportunity for AS engagement,
      113 participants who completed >/=3 months on study were analyzed. HCPs most
      often accessed dashboard data regarding medication ingestion and missed doses.
      HCPs recommended adherence counseling and participant education most often.
      Participants whose HCPs used the dashboard more and recommended adherence
      counseling and participant education (n=61) improved significantly more than
      participants with less dashboard-active HCPs (n=49) in CGI-I mean score (2.9
      versus 3.4 [p=0.004]), total PANSS (mean change: -9.2 versus -3.1 [p=0.0002]),
      PANSS positive subscale (-3.2 versus -1.5 [p=0.003]), PANSS general subscale
      (-4.3 versus -1.2 [p=0.02]), and Marder factor for negative symptoms (-1.9 versus
      0.0 [p=0.03]). Most HCPs found the dashboard easy to use (74%) and helpful for
      improving conversations with participants about their treatment plan and progress
      (78%). Conclusion: This provider dashboard may facilitate discussions with
      patients about regular medication-taking, which can improve patient outcomes.

PG  - 892820
LID - 10.3389/fnmol.2022.892820 [doi]
AB  - Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a severe neurogenetic disorder for which
      three causal genes, CACNA1A, SCN1A, and ATP1A2, have been implicated. However,
      more than 80% of referred diagnostic cases of hemiplegic migraine (HM) are
      negative for exonic mutations in these known FHM genes, suggesting the
      involvement of other genes. Using whole-exome sequencing data from 187
      mutation-negative HM cases, we identified rare variants in the CACNA1I gene
      encoding the T-type calcium channel Cav3.3. Burden testing of CACNA1I variants
      showed a statistically significant increase in allelic burden in the HM case
      group compared to gnomAD (OR = 2.30, P = 0.00005) and the UK Biobank (OR = 2.32, 
      P = 0.0004) databases. Dysfunction in T-type calcium channels, including Cav3.3, 
      has been implicated in a range of neurological conditions, suggesting a potential
      role in HM. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we compared the biophysical
      properties of five Cav3.3 variants (p.R111G, p.M128L, p.D302G, p.R307H, and
      p.Q1158H) to wild-type (WT) channels expressed in HEK293T cells. We observed
      numerous functional alterations across the channels with Cav3.3-Q1158H showing
      the greatest differences compared to WT channels, including reduced current
      density, right-shifted voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and
      slower current kinetics. Interestingly, we also found significant differences in 
      the conductance properties exhibited by the Cav3.3-R307H and -Q1158H variants
      compared to WT channels under conditions of acidosis and alkalosis. In light of
      these data, we suggest that rare variants in CACNA1I may contribute to HM
      etiology.

TI  - Early Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Combined With
      Sertraline in Adolescents With First-Episode Major Depressive Disorder.
PG  - 853961
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.853961 [doi]
AB  - Background: Adolescence is a period of high incidence for depression. However,
      there is a limited treatment option for the adolescent depression. For
      treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, HF-rTMS of the left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) appears therapeutically effective. The aim of the study
      is to explore the early effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      in combination with sertraline in adolescents with first-episode major depressive
      disorder. Methods: A total of 100 teenage patients with first-episode depression 
      were randomly divided into the study groups. Both groups were treated with
      sertraline. In addition, the study group was treated with ten sessions of add-on 
      rTMS. The control group was given sertraline only. The depressive symptom and
      cognitive function were assessed by the Hamilton depression rating scale 17
      version (HAMD-17), Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R),
      Integrated visual and auditory continuous performance test (IVA-CPT), and
      THINC-it. Results: The number of early improvers after 2 weeks of treatment in
      the study group was statistically significant higher compared to the control
      group (95.83% vs 73.47%, chi(2) = 9.277, P = 0.002). There was significant
      difference observed in responder rates (62.50% vs. 28.57%, chi(2) = 11.262, P =
      0.001) or in remission rates (31.25% vs. 6.12%, chi(2) = 10.130, P = 0.001)
      between the two groups at 4 weeks. The score of HAMD-17 and CDRS-R in the study
      group were significantly lower than the control group (Fgroup = 12.91 vs 10.21, P
      < 0.05). Attention Quotient (listening, visual and full-scale) attention quotient
      of IVA-CPT in the study group were higher than those in the control group after
      treatment, and the differences were statistically significant(P < 0.05). The
      study group showed higher score in Spotter than the control group after treatment
      (P < 0.05). Discussion: This is the most extensive blinded, randomized clinical
      study to date examining the efficacy of 10-Hz add-on rTMS for first-onset
      adolescent depression. Our results support that add-on rTMS accelerates the
      efficacy of the antidepressants, improving the depressive symptoms and cold
      cognitive function in first-episode adolescent depression. Clinical Trial

AB  - Background: While repeated shutdown and lockdown measures helped contain the
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and
      self-isolation negatively impacted global mental health in 2020 and 2021.
      Although suicide rates did reportedly not increase during the first months of the
      pandemic, long-term data, and data on the quality of serious violent suicide
      attempts (SVSAs) are not available to date. Materials and methods: Orthopaedic
      trauma patient visits to the emergency department (ED), ED trauma team
      activations, and SVSAs were retrospectively evaluated from January 2019 until May
      2021 in four Level-I Trauma Centers in Berlin, Germany. SVSAs were assessed for
      suicide method, injury pattern and severity, type of treatment, and length of
      hospital stay. Results: Significantly fewer orthopaedic trauma patients presented
      to EDs during the pandemic (n = 70,271) compared to the control (n = 84,864)
      period (p = 0.0017). ED trauma team activation numbers remained unchanged. SVSAs 
      (corrected for seasonality) also remained unchanged during control (n = 138) and 
      pandemic (n = 129) periods, and no differences were observed for suicide methods,
      injury patterns, or length of hospital stay. Conclusion: Our data emphasize that 
      a previously reported rise in psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic
      does not coincide with increased SVSA rates or changes in quality of SVSAs.

TI  - Association between bilirubin and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the
      non-obese Chinese population: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 522
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-1187 [doi]
AB  - Background: Serum bilirubin may play a role in preventing antioxidant and
      cytoprotective effects in physiological conditions. Serum bilirubin levels are
      inversely correlated with insulin resistance and the prevalence of cardiovascular
      diseases and diabetes mellitus. However, the correlation between serum bilirubin 
      and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unclear. NAFLD in non-obese
      participants may lead to serious health problems, calling for prompt recognition 
      and early management. This study aimed at investigating the relationship between 
      the serum bilirubin levels and NAFLD in non-obese Chinese adults. Methods: We
      evaluated 4,900 non-obese subjects (body mass index <25 kg/m(2)) residing in
      Wuwei, China. The subjects received a baseline questionnaire, physical
      examination, abdominal ultrasonography, and laboratory check-ups. Fasting serum
      bilirubin was measured with an automated biochemical analyzer. NAFLD was
      diagnosed based on imaging findings of fatty liver disease on ultrasonography,
      without excessive alcohol intake and other known causes for chronic liver
      disease. A logistic regression model was applied to calculate the association
      between serum bilirubin level and NAFLD in non-obese subjects. Results: NAFLD was
      diagnosed in 408 (203 men) of the subjects, and they had a mean age of
      51-year-old. Non-obese NAFLD patients had lower serum direct bilirubin (DBIL)
      levels than control group did [2.50 (1.80-3.25) vs. 2.60 (1.90-3.50), P=0.004],
      but no significant differences in indirect bilirubin (IBIL) and total bilirubin
      (TBIL) levels of the two groups was seen (both P>0.05). After adjusting
      confounding factors such as age, gender, body mass index, blood glucose, and
      blood lipids, multivariate analysis showed serum DBIL (OR: 0.96, 95% CI:
      0.83-1.11, P trend =0.6022), IBIL (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.89-1.17, P trend =0.7756),
      and TBIL (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.87-1.15, P trend =0.991) levels were not associated
      with NAFLD in the non-obese population. In addition, subgroup analyses
      (stratified according to age, gender, and medical histories of hypertension, and 
      diabetes mellitus) suggested no independent association between NAFLD and DBIL,
      IBIL, or TBIL. Conclusions: Our data suggest that serum bilirubin levels are
      unlikely to be associated with NAFLD in non-obese subjects.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of chimeric antigen receptor T cells in digestive system 
      cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 508
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-5019 [doi]
AB  - Background: As a successful treatment for hematological malignancy, chimeric
      antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) have been expanded to solid tumors to
      demonstrate their safety and efficacy, especially for digestive system cancer
      (DSC). Various CAR-T cell constructs used in different types of DSCs result in
      heterogeneous responses. Thus, we aimed to systematically summarize the clinical 
      response of DSCs treated with CAR-T cells and investigate factors associated with
      heterogeneity in outcomes. Methods: Clinical studies of DSC patients treated with
      CAR-T cell therapy were selected from the PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of
      Science databases before October 1, 2020. "CAR-T cell", "solid tumor" and their
      synonymous terms were used to construct the search strategy. Duplicates, reviews,
      non-English literature, articles not related to clinical studies or CAR-T cells
      used for digestive tumors were excluded. The included studies were assessed by
      the Institute of Health Economics (IHE) risk of bias tool to check the
      methodological quality. The inverse variance method was used to perform data
      pooling and subgroup analysis to clarify the causes of heterogeneity. Publication
      bias was examined by funnel plots and Egger's test. Results: Twelve studies were 
      included, and the risk of bias evaluation was demonstrated as plots using Review 
      Manager 5.3. The pooled overall response rate (ORR) was 2% (95% CI: 0-6%), and
      the clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 42% (95% CI: 24-61%). According to subgroup
      analysis, costimulation (P=0.0449), lymphodepletion (P=0.0002), persistence of
      CAR-T cells (P=0.0443) and transduction method (P=0.0165) were factors
      contributing to heterogeneity. For adverse effects, pyrexia was the most frequent
      (35%, 95% CI: 24-61%). No publication bias was found, and the major results were 
      robust within a slight fluctuation for each removal of one of the 12 studies.
      Discussion: CAR-T cell therapy is generally beneficial for patients with DSCs
      though the ORR was still poor. Modified construction with more specific tumor
      antigens, costimulatory domain and lentiviral vectors is necessary to obtain a
      better antitumor response of CAR-T cell therapy. Information of survival data are
      needed for a more comprehensive analysis.

TI  - Direct electromagnetic coupling to determine diagnostic bone fracture stiffness.
PG  - 510
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-5315 [doi]
AB  - Background: Rapid prediction of adverse bone fracture healing outcome (e.g.,
      nonunion and/or delayed union) is essential to advise adjunct therapies to reduce
      patient suffering and improving healing outcome. Radiographic diagnostic methods 
      remain ineffective during early healing, resulting in average nonunion diagnosis 
      times surpassing six months. To address this clinical deficit, we developed a
      novel diagnostic device to predict fracture healing outcome by noninvasive
      telemetric measurements of fracture bending stiffness. This study evaluated the
      hypothesis that our diagnostic antenna system is capable of accurately measuring 
      temporal fracture healing stiffness, and advises the utility of this data for
      expedited prediction of healing outcomes during early (</=3 weeks) fracture
      recovery. Methods: Fracture repair was simulated, in reverse chronology, by
      progressively destabilizing cadaveric ovine metatarsals (n=8) stabilized via
      locking plate fixation. Bending stiffness of each fracture state were predicted
      using a novel direct electromagnetic coupling diagnostic system, and results were
      compared to values from material testing (MT) methods. While direct calculation
      of fracture stiffness in a simplistic cadaver model is possible, comparable
      analysis of the innumerable permutations of fracture and treatment type is not
      feasible. Thus, clinical feasibility of direct electromagnetic coupling was
      explored by parametric finite element (FE) analyses (n=1,632 simulations).
      Implant mechanics were simulated throughout the course of healing for cases with 
      variations to fracture size, implant type, implant structure, and implant
      material. Results: For all fracture states, stiffness values predicted by the
      direct electromagnetic coupling system were not significantly different than
      those quantified by in vitro MT methods [P=0.587, P=0.985, P=0.975; for comparing
      intact, destabilized, and fully fractured (FF) states; respectively]. In
      comparable models, the total implant deflection reduction (from FF to intact
      states) was less than 10% different between direct electromagnetic coupling
      measurements (82.2 microm) and FE predictions (74.7 microm). For all treatment
      parameters, FE analyses predicted nonlinear reduction in bending induced implant 
      midspan deflections for increasing callus stiffness. Conclusions: This technology
      demonstrates potential as a noninvasive clinical tool to accurately quantify
      healing fracture stiffness to augment and expedite healing outcome predictions
      made using radiographic imaging.

TI  - The role of head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation in sudden cardiac arrest: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 515
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-4984 [doi]
AB  - Background: Head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation (HU-CPR) is an experimental
      treatment for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), where cardiopulmonary resuscitation
      (CPR) is performed in a ramped position. We evaluated whether HU-CPR improved
      survival and surrogate outcomes as compared to standard CPR (S-CPR). Methods:
      Studies reporting on HU-CPR in SCA were searched for in PubMed, Embase and
      Cochrane Library from inception to May 1st 2021. Outcomes included
      neurologically-intact survival, 24-hour-survival, intracranial pressure (ICP),
      cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP) and brain blood flow (BBF). Risk of bias was 
      assessed using the GRADE assessment tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Fixed- and
      random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled effects of HU-CPR at 30
      degrees. Results: Thirteen articles met the criteria for inclusion (11
      animal-only studies, one before-and-after human-only study, one study that
      utilized human- and animal-cadavers). Among animal studies, the most common
      implementation of HU-CPR was a 30-degree upward tilt of the head and thorax
      (n=7), while four studies investigated controlled sequential elevation (CSE). Two
      animal studies reported improved cerebral performance category (CPC) scores at
      24-hour. The pooled effect on 24-hour survival was not statistically significant 
      (P=0.37). The lone human study reported doubled return of spontaneous circulation
      (ROSC) (17.9% versus 34.2%, P<0.0001). The pooled effect on ROSC in three porcine
      studies was OR =3.63 (95% CI: 0.72-18.39). Pooled effects for surrogate
      physiological outcomes of intracranial cranial pressure (MD -14.08, 95% CI:
      -23.21 to -4.95, P=0.003), CerPP (MD 14.39, 95% CI: 3.07-25.72, P=0.01) and BBF
      (MD 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02-0.27, P=0.03), showed statistically significant benefit.
      Discussion: Overall, HU-CPR improved neurologically-intact survival at 24-hour,
      ROSC and physiological surrogate outcomes in animal models. Despite promising
      preclinical data, and one human observational study, clinical equipoise remains
      surrounding the role of HU-CPR in SCA, necessitating clarification with future
      randomized human trials.

AB  - Background: The present study sought to explore the efficacy of one-third tubular
      steel plates and screws for the treatment of medial column of pilon fractures.
      Methods: The present retrospective study comprised 40 subjects with
      Ruedi-Allgower type III pilon fractures that attended Northern Jiangsu People's
      Hospital from April 2016 to April 2019. Patients were assigned to 2 groups based 
      on reconstruction and fixation components used on the medial column. The medial
      column of participants in the control group (n=20) was anchored using screws. The
      medial column for subjects in the treatment group (n=20) was reconstructed using 
      a one-third tubular steel plate. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society 
      (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after operation,
      intraoperative blood loss, fracture healing time, preoperative detumescence
      duration, operation time, postoperative weightbearing duration, and postoperative
      Burwell-Charnley radiological score of the 2 groups were compared. Results: The
      findings showed that intraoperative blood loss, preoperative detumescence time,
      and operation time for the treatment group were not statistically different
      relative to the control group (P>0.05). The fracture healing time and
      postoperative weightbearing time in the treatment group were 15.07+/-0.98 weeks
      and 6.91+/-0.61 weeks, respectively, while those in the control group were
      15.84+/-0.59 weeks and 8.60+/-0.53 weeks, respectively (P<0.05). Patients in the 
      treatment group showed markedly higher AOFAS scores relative to the AOFAS scores 
      of subjects in the control group at month 1, 2, and 3 post-operation (P<0.05).
      AOFAS scores for the 2 groups were not significantly different at month 6, 12 and
      24 post-operation. Subjects in the control group had a significantly lower
      Burwell-Charnley number radiology score relative to that of subjects in the
      treatment group (P<0.05). Conclusions: The present findings show that the medial 
      column of subjects with Ruedi-Allgower type III pilon fracture can be repaired
      using a one-third tubular steel plate. Compared with simple screw fixation, the
      use of a one-third tubular steel plate allows earlier postoperative
      weightbearing, decreases the rate of postoperative reduction loss, and leads to
      better clinical effects and prognosis.

TI  - Development and validation of an eight-gene signature based predictive model to
      evaluate the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients: a bioinformatic
      study.
PG  - 524
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-1934 [doi]
AB  - Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with a poor
      prognosis, however, biomarkers for the prognostic assessment of HCC remain
      suboptimal. Consequently, we aimed to develop a reliable tool for prognostic
      estimation of HCC. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and
      adjacent normal tissues in 3 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were
      identified, followed by hub gene selection and least absolute shrinkage and
      selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression to develop a prognostic gene signature.
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox regression,
      time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), and integrated value of time-dependent
      AUC (iAUC) were used to assess the relationship between predictors and clinical
      outcomes in the training and validation datasets. Then we built nomograms
      including gene signature and clinicopathological factors to forecast the
      probability of death. Moreover, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to
      compare the expression of prognostic genes between HCC and adjacent normal
      tissues. Finally, the relationship between prognostic genes and tumor
      microenvironment (TME) was investigated using immune cell infiltration algorithms
      and single cell transcriptomic database. Results: Eight prognostic genes (CDC20, 
      PTTG1, TOP2A, CXCL2, CXCL14, CYP2C9, MT1F, and GHR) were finally identified to
      construct the gene signature. Each patient's risk score was calculated according 
      to the gene signature. Patients with high-risk scores showed worse outcomes in
      the training set [hazard ratio (HR) =3.404, P<0.001]. Risk score, age, body mass 
      index (BMI), and TNM stage were identified as independent prognostic factors for 
      overall survival (OS) in the training set. The nomogram including risk score and 
      other independent prognostic factors showed better performance as opposed to the 
      clinicopathological model. In the validation dataset, we obtained the similar
      results as well. Moreover, we found a close relationship between risk score and
      immune cell infiltration. Patients with high-risk scores had elevated expression 
      of immune checkpoint genes, indicating that these patients may be more suitable
      for immunotherapy. Conclusions: We have established and validated an eight-gene
      based prognostic model, which could be an effective tool for the prognostic
      evaluation of HCC patients.

PG  - 514
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-4980 [doi]
AB  - Background: Early and accurate diagnosis of invasive fungal infection (IFI) is
      pivotal for the initiation of effective antifungal therapy for patients with
      hematologic malignancies. Methods: This retrospective study involved 235 patients
      with hematologic malignancies and pulmonary infections diagnosed as IFIs (n=118) 
      or bacterial pneumonia (n=117). Patients were randomly divided into training
      (n=188) and validation (n=47) datasets. Four feature selection methods with nine 
      classifiers were implemented to select the optimal machine learning (ML) model
      using five-fold cross-validation. A radiomic signature was constructed using a
      linear ML algorithm, and a radiomic score (Radscore) was calculated. The combined
      model was developed with the Radscore, the significant clinical and radiologic
      factors were selected using multivariable logistic regression, and the results
      were presented as a clinical radiomic nomogram. A prospective pilot study was
      also conducted to compare the classification performance of the combined nomogram
      with practicing radiologists. Results: Significant differences were found in the 
      Radscore between IFI and bacterial pneumonia patients in the training (0.683 vs. 
      -0.724, P<0.001) and validation set (0.353 vs. -0.717, P=0.002). The combined
      model showed good discrimination performance in the validation cohort [area under
      the curve (AUC) =0.844] and outperformed the clinical (AUC =0.696) and radiomics 
      (AUC =0.767) model alone (both P<0.05). Conclusions: The clinical radiomic
      nomogram can serve as a promising predictive tool for IFI in patients with
      hematologic malignancies.

TI  - Complications and oncological outcomes after salvage surgery for recurrent and
      residual hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: a retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 525
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-1844 [doi]
AB  - Background: Salvage surgery for hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC)
      after radiotherapy may result in several postoperative complications and the
      oncological outcome is unsatisfying. Therefore, identifying the risk factors for 
      postoperative complications and oncological outcome after salvage surgery is
      important. This study aimed to determine which HPSCC patients might benefit from 
      salvage surgery following previous radiotherapy. Methods: We retrospectively
      analyzed 91 HPSCC patients who underwent salvage surgery due to locoregional
      recurrence/residual disease after radiotherapy. The pre- and intraoperative
      characteristics with complications and oncological outcomes were collected
      through medical records and telephone follow-up. Risk factors for complications
      were analyzed by binary logistic regression. The oncological outcomes were
      assessed by overall survival (OS) after salvage surgery. Kaplan-Meier curves and 
      Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were used for univariate and
      multivariate survival analyses. Results: Postoperative complications occurred in 
      40.7% of patients, with pharyngo-cutaneous fistula (PCF) occurring in 29.7% of
      patients. Salvage surgery for local disease was the only independent risk factor 
      for postoperative complications and PCF [complications: odds ratio (OR) =5.298,
      95% confidence interval (CI): 1.163-24.130, P=0.031; PCF: OR =4.543, 95% CI:
      1.187-17.387, P=0.027). In the subgroup of patients with local disease, time of
      curative treatment initiation >90 days (OR =7.331, 95% CI: 1.278-42.054, P=0.025)
      and preoperative hemoglobin <118 g/L (OR =10.101, 95% CI: 1.026-99.492, P=0.045) 
      were independent risk factors for postoperative complications, while free flap
      reconstruction was an independent protective factor for PCF (OR =0.099, 95% CI:
      0.010-0.934, P=0.043). The median OS time was 17 months, with 5-year OS rates of 
      30%. Age at salvage surgery <50 years [hazard ratio (HR) =2.047, 95% CI:
      1.217-3.443, P=0.007] and recurrence or retreatment clinical T stage 3-4 (rcT3-4)
      (HR =2.051, 95% CI: 1.219-3.450, P=0.007) were identified as risk factors for OS.
      The 5-year OS rates of patients without and with both risk factors were 43% and
      10% (P=0.001). Conclusions: Salvage surgery for locoregional recurrence/residual 
      disease after previous radiotherapy could improve survival in selected patients
      with HPSCC. Patients with local recurrence/residual disease had a higher
      complication rate. Efforts can be made to shorten the time of curative treatment 
      initiation and treat anemia to reduce the risk of postoperative complications in 
      this subgroup.

AB  - Background: New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Lancet, Journal of the
      American Medical Association (JAMA), and British Medical Journal (BMJ) are
      collectively known as "the Top Four Medical Journals (TFMJ)" in China. Through
      the analysis of Chinese scholars' publications in the TFMJ in the recent 10
      years, this study aimed to clarify the current situation of high-quality medical 
      research conducted by Chinese scholars and institutions. Methods: Data were
      retrieved and downloaded manually from PubMed (2011-2020). Information on the
      publication year, journal, author, affiliation, and citation, etc. were extracted
      and analyzed using R software. Results: A total of 761 articles were involved in 
      the final analysis. The number of articles published by Chinese scholars in the
      TFMJ was 135/29,942 (0.45%) in BMJ, 124/14,033 (0.88%) in JAMA, 314/16,117
      (1.94%) in Lancet, and 188/15,242 (1.23%) in NEJM (P<0.001). Besides, the letter 
      was the main research type, which was up to 44.54%, and the original research
      only accounted for 17.47%. The most popular subspecialty and subject were
      infectious diseases and COVID-19, respectively. The most productive researcher
      was Chen Wang, and Bin Cao was the most cited Chinese scholar. The most
      productive institute was Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union
      Medical College. The most cited study was "Clinical features of patients infected
      with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China". Conclusions: The presence of
      Chinese scholars in the TFMJ has grown, but there is still much room to improve. 
      A Matthew effect in China's high-level scientific research was demonstrated.

TI  - SLC2A1 plays a significant prognostic role in lung adenocarcinoma and is
      associated with tumor immunity based on bioinformatics analysis.
PG  - 519
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-1430 [doi]
AB  - Background: The treatment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has been stuck in a
      bottleneck due to a number of factors. There is a pressing need for research into
      potential genetic markers to help drug development and improve the prognosis of
      patients. SLC2A1 has been reported in multiple LUAD-related prognosis prediction 
      signatures. However, the role of SLC2A1 in the occurrence and development of LUAD
      and its impact on prognosis remain elusive. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas
      (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to acquire the samples. We
      used R to perform statistical analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA),
      immune infiltration and immune cell correlation analysis, drug sensitivity
      analysis, and visualization. The immune cell score was calculated using the
      Timer2.0 database. Prognostic analysis was performed using R, Gene Expression
      Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and the Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Overall
      survival and progression free survival were the main outcome of prognosis
      analysis. Protein-protein interaction, disease-genetics analysis, and
      tissue-specific enrichment analyses were performed using Metascape. Results:
      SLC2A1 was highly expressed in LUAD tissues. Univariate COX regression [hazard
      ratio (HR) =1.689, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.242-2.249, P<0.001] and
      multivariate COX regression including age, gender, smoking, TNM stage and SLC2A1 
      expression (HR =1.567, 95% CI: 1.127-2.179, P=0.008) showed that SLC2A1 was an
      independent prognostic risk factor for LUAD. GSEA and Metascape analysis showed
      that SLC2A1 was strongly associated with the cell cycle, mitosis, lung tissue,
      and tumor recurrence. Immune correlation analysis showed that SLC2A1 was
      associated with two tumor infiltration immune cells: activated CD (cluster of
      differentiation)4(+) memory T cells (r=0.31, P=0.003) and activated mast cells
      (r=-0.28, P=0.010). Moreover, patients with high SLC2A1 expression had higher
      immune checkpoint molecules and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE)
      scores, indicating poorer immunotherapy efficacy. Patients with high SLC2A1
      expression were more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs and less sensitive to
      targeted drugs compared to those with low SLC2A1 expression. Conclusions: The
      high expression of SLC2A1 in LUAD predicted poor prognosis and was closely
      related to tumor immunity, which could be used as an effective prognostic
      biomarker to provide a new strategy for clinical prognosis assessment and
      immunotherapy for LUAD.

TI  - Wedge resection before lobectomy for patients with T1N0M0 non-small cell lung
      cancer: a propensity score matching analysis.
PG  - 502
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-5246 [doi]
AB  - Background: Whether wedge resection of a tumor before lobectomy (Wed + Lob) can
      improve the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has yet to be
      determined comprehensively. This study aimed to compare the effects of Wed + Lob 
      with those of direct lobectomy (Lob) on survival and tumor cell dissemination in 
      patients with T1N0M0 NSCLC. Methods: A cohort of 813 patients with T1N0M0 NSCLC
      who underwent lobectomy at a single center in China was investigated. After
      propensity score matching, the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival
      (DFS) of patients were estimated using Kaplan-Meier plots. Associations between
      surgical strategies and patient survival were computed as hazard ratios and 95%
      confidence intervals using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Changes in
      folate receptor-positive circulating tumor cells (FR+ CTCs) after lobectomy were 
      analyzed in another cohort from our hospital. Results: A total of 401 Wed + Lob
      cases were matched with 255 Lob cases according to their propensity scores.
      Although no significant differences were found in OS, multivariate analysis
      showed that patients with T1N0M0 NSCLC in the Wed + Lob group had significantly
      improved DFS (HR =0.583; P=0.012) compared to those in the Lob group. After
      surgery, a decrease in FR+ CTCs was observed in 21 of 23 patients (91.3%) in the 
      Wed + Lob group and in 16 of 23 patients (69.6%) in the Lob group [mean changes: 
      6.10 (+/-7.80) FU per 3 mL vs. 1.31 (+/-4.39) FU per 3 mL; P=0.014]. Conclusions:
      Wed + Lob may improve DFS and reduce tumor cell dissemination in patients with
      T1N0M0 NSCLC.

AB  - Background: Whether gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) pretreatment
      before transferring frozen-thawed embryos (FETs) could improve the clinical
      outcome of adenomyosis-associated infertile patients with 56 cm(3) </= uterine
      volume </=100 cm(3) is unclear. Methods: Adenomyosis patients who underwent in
      vitro fertilization and frozen embryo transfers from January 2009 to December
      2019 with 56 cm(3) </= uterine volume </=100 cm(3) were included in this
      retrospective cohort study. The subjects were divided into two groups (GnRH-a
      treatment group vs. GnRH-a-free group). The effect of GnRH-a treatment before FET
      on pregnancy outcomes was explored by univariate and multivariate analysis. In
      the GnRH-a treatment group, uterine volume before and after GnRH-a pretreatment
      was also compared by t-tests. Results: A total of 186 patients undergoing 263
      cryopreserved embryo transfer cycles were included. There was no significant
      difference in terms of the clinical pregnancy rate between patients in the GnRH-a
      treatment group (24/45, 53.3%) and the GnRH-a-free group (86/218, 39.4%)
      (P=0.098). The miscarriage rate in the GnRH-a treatment group (3/24, 12.5%) was
      significantly lower than that in the GnRH-a-free group (32/86, 37.2%) (P=0.044). 
      The live birth rate in the GnRH-a treatment group (21/45, 46.7%) was
      significantly higher than that in the GnRH-a-free group (54/218, 24.8%)
      (P=0.009). However, the uterine volume did not change significantly before
      (82.0+/-13.4 cm(3)) or after GnRH-a treatment (79.3+/-14.0 cm(3)), with a
      P=0.123. Conclusions: GnRH-a pretreatment before FET reduced the miscarriage rate
      and improved the live birth rate among infertile women with adenomyosis whose
      uterine volume was 56-100 cm(3).

TI  - Influence of Single Experience with Intraoperative Near-Infrared Autofluorescence
      on Postoperative Parathyroid Insufficiency after Thyroidectomy - A Preliminary
      Clinical Study.
PG  - 1334-1339
LID - 10.7150/ijms.72886 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Total thyroidectomy has become the most common thyroid procedure.
      This treatment method results in most postoperative hypocalcemia (PH) and
      hypoparathyroidism (HPT) cases due to the unwitting removal of the parathyroid
      glands (PTGs). Near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) is a new method that helps 
      identify PTGs. This study aimed to determine whether short-term experience with
      intraoperative NIRAF may influence postoperative complications after
      thyroidectomy. Materials and methods: Overall, 65 patients who underwent
      thyroidectomy by one high-volume surgeon were enrolled in the study between March
      2018 and August 2021. In August 2020, the surgeon performed four operations using
      the NIRAF device. After that experience, the technique of operating and
      preserving PTGs has been totally changed. Postoperative serum calcium (Ca) and
      parathormone (PTH) concentrations were measured. Using retrospective study
      analysis, we assessed the rate of PH and HPT. Results: There was no statistically
      significant difference in Ca (p = 0.1612) and PTH (p = 0.3590) concentrations
      between groups operated on before and after the NIRAF experience. The serum
      concentrations of Ca and PTH of all patients were positively correlated (r =
      0.4074; p = 0.0022) as well as the Ca concentration and age of patients (r =
      0.3292; p = 0.0116), respectively. Conclusions: These findings suggest that
      short-term NIRAF experience, and changing attitude to preserving PTGs does not
      affect thyroidectomy outcomes, even when utilized by a highly experienced
      high-volume thyroid surgeon. However, continuous use of NIRAF might enhance
      treatment outcomes, particularly for surgeons with limited experience.

      Population.
PG  - 1300-1306
LID - 10.7150/ijms.73026 [doi]
AB  - Background: LncRNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript
      1) was competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) involved in various molecular processes
      for metastasis development in lung cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      in MALAT1 gene might be predictive markers for lung cancer. In our study, we
      selected rs619586 and rs3200401 in MALAT1 gene to explore their effects on lung
      cancer susceptibility. Methods: The case-control study included 444 lung cancer
      cases and 460 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed by Taqman allelic
      discrimination method. Logistic regression, Student t-test, and Chi-square test
      (chi(2) ) were used to analyze the data. Results: The findings of the study
      showed that rs3200401 was significantly associated with the risk of non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Compared with
      homozygous CC genotype, CT heterozygous genotype decreased risk of NSCLC (P(a) = 
      0.034) and LUSC (P(a) = 0.025). In addition, no statistical association was
      detected between rs619586 and lung cancer susceptibility. The interactions
      between genes and cigarette smoking were discovered via crossover analysis.
      However, there were no remarkable gene-environment interactions in additive and
      multiplicative model. Conclusion: Rs3200401 in lncRNA MALAT1 was associated with 
      the susceptibility of non-small-cell lung cancer and lung squamous cell
      carcinoma. The gene-environmental (cigarette smoking) interactions were not
      notable.

      Metacaspases Involved in Cell Death Pathway.
PG  - 882561
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.882561 [doi]
AB  - The soybean root necrosis 1 (rn1) mutation causes progressive browning of the
      roots soon after germination and provides increased tolerance to the soil-borne
      oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae in soybean. Toward understanding the
      molecular basis of the rn1 mutant phenotypes, we conducted tandem mass tag
      (TMT)-labeling proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses of the root tissues of
      the rn1 mutant and progenitor T322 line to identify potential proteins involved
      in manifestation of the mutant phenotype. We identified 3,160 proteins. When the 
      p-value was set at </=0.05 and the fold change of protein accumulation between
      rn1 and T322 at >/=1.5 or </=0.67, we detected 118 proteins that showed increased
      levels and 32 proteins decreased levels in rn1 as compared to that in T322. The
      differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) are involved in several pathways
      including cellular processes for processing environmental and genetic
      information, metabolism and organismal systems. Five pathogenesis-related
      proteins were accumulated to higher levels in the mutant as compared to that in
      T322. Several of the DAPs are involved in hormone signaling, redox reaction,
      signal transduction, and cell wall modification processes activated in
      plant-pathogen interactions. The phosphoproteomics analysis identified 22
      phosphopeptides, the levels of phosphorylation of which were significantly
      different between rn1 and T322 lines. The phosphorylation levels of two type II
      metacaspases were reduced in rn1 as compared to T322. Type II metacaspase has
      been shown to be a negative regulator of hypersensitive cell death. In absence of
      the functional Rn1 protein, two type II metacaspases exhibited reduced
      phosphorylation levels and failed to show negative regulatory cell death function
      in the soybean rn1 mutant. We hypothesize that Rn1 directly or indirectly
      phosphorylates type II metacaspases to negatively regulate the cell death process
      in soybean roots.

      Bioavailability.
PG  - 935829
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.935829 [doi]
AB  - The activity of extracellular phosphatases is a dynamic process controlled by
      both plant roots and microorganisms, which is responsible for the mineralization 
      of soil phosphorus (P). Plants regulate the availability of soil P through the
      release of root mucilage and the exudation of low-molecular weight organic acids 
      (LMWOAs). Mucilage increases soil hydraulic conductivity as well as pore
      connectivity, both of which are associated with increased phosphatase activity.
      The LMWOAs, in turn, stimulate the mineralization of soil P through their
      synergistic effects of acidification, chelation, and exchange reactions. This
      article reviews the catalytic properties of extracellular phosphatases and their 
      interactions with the rhizosphere interfaces. We observed a biphasic effect of
      root metabolic products on extracellular phosphatases, which notably altered
      their catalytic mechanism. In accordance with the proposed conceptual framework, 
      soil P is acquired by both plants and microorganisms in a coupled manner that is 
      characterized by the exudation of their metabolic products. Due to inactive or
      reduced root exudation, plants recycle P through adsorption on the soil matrix,
      thereby reducing the rhizosphere phosphatase activity. The two-phase conceptual
      framework might assist in understanding P-acquisition (substrate turnover) and
      P-restoration (phosphatase adsorption by soil) in various terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Relationship between active Helicobacter pylori infection and anemia, iron
      deficiency, iron deficiency anemia: A cross-sectional study in a sub-Saharan
      setting.
PG  - 554-568
LID - 10.1002/jgh3.12787 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aim: There have been contradictory reports about the association
      between Helicobacter pylori infection and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Based on 
      the high frequency of H. pylori infection in Cameroon, we have evaluated the
      frequency of H. pylori infection as the cause of anemia, and IDA among dyspeptic 
      patients in Cameroon. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 842 dyspeptic 
      patients (472 women and 370 men) in two reference hospitals in Douala-Cameroon.
      Each participant gave a written consent, and the study was approved by the
      National Ethical Committee. Erythroid-related indices and markers of iron
      deficiency (ID) measurement were done for each participant as well as H. pylori
      detection. Data were analyzed using SSPS statistical package. Results: The
      prevalence of anemia, ID, IDA, and H. pylori infection was 65.08%, 31.47%,
      25.65%, and 80.88%, respectively. H. pylori infected individuals had a
      significantly lower mean value of hemoglobin (P = 0.01), hematocrit (P = 0.04),
      ferritin (P = 0.03) and coefficient of transferrin saturation (CTS) levels (P =
      0.04) and a significantly higher mean value of mean corpuscular hemoglobin
      concentration (MCHC) (P = 0.02). Compared with H. pylori non-infected
      participants, H. pylori infected patients were 1.2938 (95% confidence interval
      [CI]: 0.9087-1.8421), 1.1851 (95% CI: 0.8122-1.7292), and 1.5636 (95% CI:
      1.0206-2.3953) times at higher risk to develop anemia, ID, and IDA, respectively.
      A significant relationship was found between H. pylori infection and IDA (P =
      0.04 and 0.04 for crude and age/sex-adjusted, respectively). Conclusion: H.
      pylori infection seems to be associated with anemia, and IDA among dyspeptic
      patients in our milieu.

TI  - Usefulness of colestimide for diarrhea in postoperative Crohn's disease.
PG  - 547-553
LID - 10.1002/jgh3.12786 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aim: Crohn's disease (CD) often causes intractable diarrhea after 
      intestinal resection. Anion exchange resins have been reported to be effective in
      patients with bile acid diarrhea after distal ileectomy; furthermore, bile acid
      metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of CD. Therefore, we aimed to 
      examine the effectiveness of colestimide in the management of postoperative CD,
      and to compare its impact between patients with and those without ileocecal
      resection. Methods: Postoperative CD patients prescribed colestimide for diarrhea
      between April 2017 and December 2020 were retrospectively evaluated for changes
      in the total Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), each CDAI component including
      diarrhea frequency/week, albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was evaluated
      before and after the administration of colestimide. Furthermore, comprehensive
      patient and physician assessments were reviewed from medical records during the
      first outpatient visit as a global clinical judgment after the initiation of
      colestimide therapy. Results: A total of 24 patients were included, of whom 17
      had a previous history of ileocecal resection. Significant improvement was noted 
      in CDAI and diarrhea frequency only in the ileocecal resection group (CDAI: 114.5
      +/- 52.7 and 95.4 +/- 34.8, P < 0.05; diarrhea frequency/week 23.8 +/- 14.1 and
      15.4 +/- 11.2, P < 0.05, respectively). There was no significant improvement in
      other CDAI components, albumin level, or CRP level in either group. In the global
      clinical judgment, 13 and 4 patients in the ileocecal and non-ileocecal resection
      groups, respectively, were judged as "effective," with an overall efficacy rate
      of 70.8%. Conclusion: Colestimide is effective for diarrhea in patients with
      postoperative CD, especially after ileocecal resection.

TI  - Cumulative risk of developing a new symptom in patients with primary biliary
      cholangitis and its impact on prognosis.
PG  - 577-586
LID - 10.1002/jgh3.12789 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aim: Symptoms of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) frequently
      impair one's quality of life (QOL). Nonetheless, with improved treatment, the
      prognosis of PBC also improves. QOL plays an important role in patients with PBC.
      In this study, we aimed to reevaluate the transition of new symptom development
      in PBC and its predictive factors. Methods: This retrospective multicenter study 
      enrolled 382 patients with PBC for symptom analysis. The impact of a newly
      developed symptom on PBC prognosis was investigated by Kaplan-Meier analysis with
      propensity score matching and logistic progression analysis. Results: The
      cumulative risk of developing a new symptom after 10 and 20 years of follow-up
      was 7.6 and 28.2%, and specifically that of pruritus, which was the most common
      symptom, was 6.7 and 23.3%, respectively. In Cox hazard risk analysis, serum Alb 
      level (hazard ratio [HR], 1.097; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.033-1.165; P =
      0.002), the serum D-Bil level (HR, 6.262; 95% CI, 2.522-15.553, P < 0.001), and
      Paris II criteria (HR, 0.435; 95% CI, 0.183-1.036; P = 0.037) were significant
      independent predictors of a new symptom. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the
      overall survival and liver-related death were not significant between patients
      with and without a new symptom. Conclusion: The cumulative risk of new symptom
      development is roughly 30% 20 years after diagnosis and could be predicted by
      factors including serum albumin levels, serum D-Bil level, and Paris II criteria.

      adolescents-A case study.
PG  - 914243
LID - 10.3389/fped.2022.914243 [doi]
AB  - Background and aims: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is an autosomal recessive
      disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) and platelet storage pool
      deficiency. The HPS-2 subtype is distinguished by neutropenia, and little is
      known about its periodontal phenotype in adolescents. AP3B1 is the causative gene
      for HPS-2. A 13-year-old Chinese girl presented to our department suffering from 
      gingival bleeding and tooth mobility. Her dental history was otherwise
      unremarkable. Suspecting some systemic diseases as the underlying cause, the
      patient was referred for medical consultation, a series of blood tests, and
      genetic tests. In this case study, periodontal status and mutation screening of
      one HPS-2 case are presented. Methods: Blood analysis including a complete blood 
      count (CBC) and glycated hemoglobin levels were measured. Platelet transmission
      electron microscopy (PTEM) was performed to observe the dense granules in
      platelets. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing were performed to
      confirm the pathogenic variants. Results: A medical diagnosis of HPS-2 was
      assigned to the patient. Following the medical diagnosis, a periodontal diagnosis
      of "periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease" was assigned to the
      patient. We identified novel compound heterozygous variants in AP3B1
      (NM_003664.4: exon7: c.763C>T: p.Q255(*)) and (NM_003664.4: exon1: c.53_56dup:
      p.E19Dfs(*)21) in this Chinese pedigree with HPS-2. Conclusion: This case study
      indicates the importance of periodontitis as a possible indicator of underlying
      systemic disease. Systemic disease screening is needed when a young patient
      presents with unusual, severe periodontitis, as the oral condition may be the
      first of a systemic abnormality. Our work also expands the spectrum of AP3B1
      mutations and further provides additional genetic testing information for other
      HPS-2 patients.

AB  - Purpose: This work aimed to report our experience with ultrasound-guided
      instillation for the treatment of lymphangiomas in children, so as to determine
      whether the combined use of bleomycin and dexamethasone achieved a higher
      response rate and a lower side effect rate. Methods: The medical records from
      patients with lymphangiomas between January 1st, 2013 and September 31st, 2020,
      were reviewed. Patients who received bleomycin combined with dexamethasone
      sclerotherapy were classified as the dexamethasone group, while those receiving
      bleomycin without dexamethasone were classified as the control group. Results:
      Altogether one hundred and twenty-seven patients were diagnosed with
      lymphangiomas. Among them, one hundred and five patients received bleomycin
      combined with dexamethasone injection, while the remaining twenty-two received
      bleomycin injection alone. The excellent rates were 89.52% [95% confidence
      interval (CI), 81.64-94.40%] in the dexamethasone group and 72.73% (95% CI,
      52.51-92.94%) in the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the recurrence rates
      were 3.81% (95% CI, 1.22-10.03%) in the dexamethasone group and 13.64% (95% CI,
      3.6-36.0%) in the control group (p > 0.05). After comparison between the two
      groups, the following risk factors were identified. These include >10 sacs at the
      initial stage of diagnosis, larger size after all injections, and response to the
      first injection. Conclusions: Although there was no significant difference in the
      recurrence rate between the two groups, this retrospective study demonstrated
      that the excellent response rates were dramatically improved between the two
      groups, suggesting that bleomycin combined with DEX was an effective and highly
      safe treatment for all types of pediatric lymphangiomas. Moreover, this study
      also identified three novel features as the significant risk factors for
      recurrence.

TI  - TGF-beta1-Mediated Leukocyte Cell-Derived Chemotaxin 2 Is Associated With Liver
      Fibrosis in Biliary Atresia.
PG  - 901888
LID - 10.3389/fped.2022.901888 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Biliary atresia (BA) presents as a severe infantile cholangiopathy
      disease, characterized by progressive liver fibrosis and the resulting poor
      prognosis. Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) was proposed as the key
      gene associated with hepatic fibrosis in BA, but the molecular mechanism is
      unclear. This study aims to investigate the function of LECT2 in BA. Methods: A
      total of 53 patients were enrolled in this study; 36 patients with BA, and 17
      control patients with cholestasis, including congenital biliary dilations,
      biliary hypoplasia, and inspissated bile syndrome. The role of LECT2 in BA was
      analyzed using histological and cytological tests. The correlation between LECT2 
      and infiltrating immune cells was further analyzed by bioinformatics. The
      analyses were conducted using correlational analyses and ROC curves. Results:
      LECT2 was highly expressed in infants with BA and positively related with
      fibrosis (0.1644 +/- 0.0608 vs. 0.0779 +/- 0.0053, p < 0.0001; r s = 0.85, p <
      0.0001). Serum levels of LECT2 showed high distinguishing features for patients
      with BA having an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90-1.00). CD163 was highly expressed in 
      the aggravation of fibrosis (0.158 +/- 0.062 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.078, p < 0.0001), and
      the expression of LECT2 was positively correlated with the accumulation of
      CD163(+) macrophages (r = 0.48, p = 0.003). The bioinformatic analysis also
      showed that LECT2 was positively correlated with macrophage M2 (r = 0.34, p =
      0.03). TGF-beta1 and CD163 colocalized to the portal area in the livers of
      patients with BA. Moreover, TGF-beta1 upregulated the expression of LECT2.
      Conclusion: LECT2 is highly expressed in both BA liver tissue and serum, and
      serum LECT2 is a potential diagnostic biomarker of BA. Meanwhile, TGF-beta1 is
      secreted by macrophages to regulate LECT2 associated with BA liver fibrosis.

AB  - Importance: The links between maternal and offspring adiposity and metabolic
      status are well established. There is much less evidence for the impact of these 
      relationships combined with ethnic background on cardiac structure and function
      in childhood. Objective: To test the hypothesis that ethnicity, maternal
      adiposity and glycemic status, and child adiposity affect cardiac structure and
      function. Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: A single-center
      mother-child cohort study. The cohort is a subset of the international
      multi-center Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study.
      Participants: This study included 101 healthy pre-pubertal British-born children 
      [56 White Europeans (WEs) and 45 South Asians (SAs)] with a median age of 9.1
      years, range 6.0-12.2 years, at the time of the investigation. Main Outcomes and 
      Measures: Anthropometric and echocardiographic measurements were made on the
      cohort. Maternal pregnancy and birth data were available. Relationships between
      maternal parameters (BMI and glucose status), child adiposity, and echo measures 
      were assessed. Results: Despite no ethnic difference in BMI SDS at a median age
      of 9.1 years, SA children exhibited higher levels of body fat than WE children
      (whole body, right arm, and truncal fat all p < 0.001). SA children also
      exhibited greater changes in weight and height SDS but not BMI SDS from birth
      than WE children. As expected, maternal BMI correlated with child BMI (r = 0.28; 
      p = 0.006), and body fat measures (e.g., whole body fat r = 0.25; p = 0.03).
      Maternal fasting glucose levels were associated with child body fat measures (r =
      0.22-0.28; p = 0.02-0.05). Left ventricular (LV) indices were not different
      between SA and WE children, but E/A and E'/A' (measures of diastolic function)
      were lower in SA when compared with WE children. LV indices correlated positively
      to BMI SDS and body fat markers only in SA children. Maternal fasting and 2-h
      glucose were negatively correlated with E'/A' in SA children (r = -0.53, p =
      0.015, and r = -0.49, p = 0.023, respectively) but not in WE children. Conclusion
      and Relevance: SA and WE children exhibit differences in adiposity and diastolic 
      function at a median age of 9.1 years. Novel relationships between maternal
      glycemia, child adiposity, and cardiac structure and function, present only in SA
      children, were identified.

AB  - Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection can follow primary and secondary
      maternal infection. Growing evidence indicate that secondary maternal infections 
      contribute to a much greater proportion of symptomatic cCMV than was previously
      thought. We performed a monocentric retrospective study of babies with cCMV
      evaluated from August 2004 to February 2021; we compared data of symptomatic
      children born to mothers with primary or secondary infection, both at birth and
      during follow up. Among the 145 babies with available data about maternal
      infection, 53 were classified as having symptomatic cCMV and were included in the
      study: 40 babies were born to mothers with primary infection and 13 babies were
      born to mothers with secondary infection. Analyzing data at birth, we found no
      statistical differences in the rate of clinical findings in the two groups,
      except for unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) which was significantly
      more frequent in patients born to mother with secondary infection than in those
      born to mother with primary infection (46.2 vs. 17.5%, P = 0.037). During follow 
      up, we found a higher rate of many sequelae (tetraparesis, epilepsy, motor and
      speech delay, and unilateral SNHL) in the group of children born to mothers with 
      secondary infection, with a statistical difference for tetraparesis and
      unilateral SNHL. Otherwise, only children born to mothers with primary infection 
      presented bilateral SNHL both at birth and follow up. Our data suggest that the
      risk of symptomatic cCMV and long-term sequelae is similar in children born to
      mother with primary and secondary CMV infection; it is important to pay
      appropriate attention to seropositive mothers in order to prevent reinfection and
      to detect and possibly treat infected babies.

TI  - Outcomes of Debridement, Antibiotics and Implant Retention (DAIR) for
      Periprosthetic Joint Infection in a High-Volume Arthroplasty Centre.
PG  - 1449-1456
LID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00655-y [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA)
      and total hip arthroplasty (THA) can be a devastating diagnosis. Debridement,
      antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) is a preferred treatment modality for
      acute PJI. A retrospective analysis of infected primary arthroplasties to
      evaluate the success of DAIR and factors influencing its outcomes. Methods: We
      retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent DAIR for PJI at our unit
      between 2010 and 2018. Patients who underwent revision surgery as an index
      procedure, arthroscopic washout and those with less than two years of follow-up
      were excluded. Treatment failure was defined as revision arthroplasty for
      recurrence of infection within 2 years of the index procedure. Chi-square and
      Fischer's exact test were used to compare between patient factors and DAIR
      outcomes. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank test were used to analyse
      implant survivorship following DAIR. Results: Of the sixty patients (40 knees, 20
      hips) who underwent DAIR, eighteen (13 knees, 5 hips) required revision
      arthroplasty within 2 years accounting for a success rate of 70%. Predictive
      factors for revision were American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) score of
      greater than 2 (p = 0.021), BMI > 35 (p = 0.046), C Reactive protein (CRP) > 200 
      mg/L (p = 0.007) and Staphylococcus aureus growth (p = 0.012). The five-year
      survival rate for DAIR was 70%, which remained constant after two years from
      DAIR. Conclusion: Success rate of DAIR in PJI was 70% which was comparable to
      similar studies in the literature. ASA > 2, BMI > 35, CRP > 200 and
      staphylococcus aureus growth were predictors for DAIR failure. Implant survival
      rate and duration were better following DAIR in early-onset PJI.

TI  - Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Transdermal Buprenorphine Patch and
      Conventional Analgesics in Intra-capsular Femur Neck Fracture Post
      Hemiarthroplasty.
PG  - 1363-1369
LID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00668-7 [doi]
AB  - Background: One of the most common fractures in the elderly population is a
      fracture of the neck of femur. Effective post-operative analgesia is a major
      challenge. Age-related co-morbidities restrict the choice of analgesics. The
      purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of transdermal
      buprenorphine [TDB] patch and conventional analgesics following hemiarthroplasty 
      for intra-capsular fracture neck of femur. Materials and methods: This was a
      prospective, randomized control study done in 60 patients undergoing
      hemiarthroplasty for intra-capsular fracture neck of femur over a period of 2
      years. Patients were randomized in 2 groups. Group A received a combination of IV
      paracetamol and tramadol for first 48 h followed by oral formulation. In Group B 
      patients, a transdermal buprenorphine patch of 5 mcg/h was applied at the
      beginning of surgery and was continued 2 weeks post-operative.Pain score by VAS
      was observed both at rest and on movement and followed up till 14 days
      post-operative. Primary target was to maintain a VAS </= 4. Rescue analgesic was 
      given if the VAS was >/= 6. Secondary targets were number of rescue analgesics
      required, adverse reactions and complications if any. Results: Group B had
      significantly lower pain scores at rest and during movement [p value 0.0012 to
      </= 0.0001], so was rescue analgesia requirement. No significant side effects
      were seen in TDB group. Conclusion: TDB patch is safe and provides superior
      analgesia and compliance as compared to conventional analgesics in the
      post-operative period in proximal femur fracture surgeries.

TI  - The Dynamic Effect of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Deficiency on Patellar Height.
PG  - 1403-1409
LID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00632-5 [doi]
AB  - Background: The anterior tibial translation (ATT) in case of Anterior Cruciate
      Ligament (ACL) tear can lead to dynamic alterations of the extensor apparatus
      biomechanics. The aim of this study is to evaluate the dynamic effect of isolated
      ACL deficiency on patellar height. The hypothesis is that the ATT of
      ACL-insufficient knees dynamically reduces patellar height. Methods: Skeletally
      mature patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using hamstring graft between
      January and December 2018 were included in this study. The Posterior Tibial Slope
      (PTS), Caton-Deschamps (CDI), modified Insall-Salvati (MISI), and Blackburne-Peel
      (BPI) indices were calculated in standard lateral and TELOS X-rays. The mean of
      the measurements calculated between two observers was used to compare these
      parameters. Results: 95 patients (M: 57; F: 38; 95 knees) were included in the
      study with a mean age of 31.8 years (16-56 years old). Significant patellar
      height reduction (CDI: 0.11 [- 0.32; 0.31]; MISI: 0.09 [- 0.66; 0.30]) was
      reported in TELOS compared with standard lateral knee radiography (p < 0.001).
      20.0% of the study knees reported an abnormal CDI and 84.2% (16/19 knees) of them
      reduced this index to within normal limits in TELOS. 20.0% of the knees with mild
      patella alta reduced CDI in TELOS but always remained above 1.2. Conclusions: The
      abnormal ATT in case of ACL-deficient knees results in a lowering effect of the
      patella in TELOS X-rays. In patients with ACL tear and anterior pain the
      reconstructive ligament surgery should be performed to avoid also chronic
      anterior knee pain. Level of evidence: Basic Science Study (Case Series).
      Clinical relevance: The decrease in patellar height in stress-X-rays compared
      with standard lateral knee radiography in ACL deficient knees, should be
      considered as a possible contributing cause of anterior pain in these patients.

      Critical-Size Calvarial Defects.
PG  - 1424-1430
LID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00673-w [doi]
AB  - Background/Aim: Denosumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 antibody
      developed from the ovarian cells of Chinese hamsters. We aimed to
      histomorphometrically and radiologically evaluate the effects of xenografts used 
      with local denosumab on the healing of defect sites using rabbit skulls.
      Materials and Methods: Two 10-mm diameter critical-size defects were created in
      16 rabbits. The defect areas were filled with xenografts and xenograft + 3 mg
      denosumab in the control and denosumab groups (DEN), respectively. We evaluated
      new bone, residual graft, soft tissue areas, and bone volume in 4- and 8-week
      study groups. Results: Histomorphometrically, there were no statistically
      significant differences between groups at both 4 and 8 weeks regarding residual
      graft, new bone, and soft tissue area (p > 0.05). The 4-week residual graft
      control group values were significantly higher than the 8-week values (p < 0.05).
      The soft tissue area was significantly greater in the 4-week compared with the
      8-week DEN group (p < 0.05). The radiologically measured total bone volume was
      significantly greater in the 8-week specimens than in the 4-week specimens (p <
      0.05). Conclusion: In this study, denosumab used locally with bone grafts, showed
      no direct effect on new and total bone volume.

TI  - The Evolution of Olecranon Fractures and Its Fixation Strategies.
PG  - 1385-1393
LID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00646-z [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Olecranon fractures are a common fracture of the upper extremity.
      The primary aim was to investigate the evolution of olecranon fractures and
      fixation method over a period of 12 years. The secondary aim was to compare
      complication rates of Tension Band Wiring (TBW) and Plate Fixation (PF).
      Materials and Methods: Retrospective Study for all patients with surgically
      treated olecranon fractures from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2016 from a
      tertiary trauma center. Records review for demographic, injury characteristics,
      radiographic classification and configuration, implant choices and complications.
      Results grouped into three 4-year intervals, analyzed comparatively to establish 
      significant trends over 12 years. Results: 262 patients were identified.
      Demographically, increasing mean age (48.7 to 58.9 years old, p value 0.004) and 
      higher ASA scores (7.1% ASA 3 to 21.0% ASA 3 p value 0.001). Later fractures were
      more oblique (fracture angle 86.1-100.0 degrees, p value 0.001) and comminuted
      (Schatzker D type 10.4-30.0%, p value 0.025, single fracture line 94.0-66.0%, p
      value 0.001). Implant choice, sharp increase in PF compared to TBW (PF 16.0% to
      PF 80.2%, p value 0.001). Complication-wise, TBW had higher rates of symptomatic 
      implant, implant and bony failures and implant removal. Conclusion: Demographic
      and fracture characteristic trends suggest that olecranon fractures are
      exhibiting fragility fracture characteristics (older age, higher ASA scores, more
      unstable, oblique and comminuted olecranon fractures). Having a high index of
      suspicion would alert surgeons to consider use of advanced imaging, utilize
      appropriate fixation techniques and manage the underlying osteoporosis for
      secondary fracture prevention. Despite this, trends suggest a potential
      overutilization of PF particularly for stable fracture patterns and the necessary
      precaution should be exercised.

TI  - Ellipsoidal Process of the Femoral Head in Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Effect of 
      Prophylactic Hemiepiphysiodesis.
PG  - 1431-1438
LID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00662-z [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) often causes the residual deformity,
      typically appearing as an ellipsoidal shape. In some cases, this ovalization is
      related to the asymmetric growth of the femoral head physis, which presents a
      growth-inhibiting necrotic area in the anterosuperior quadrant. The objective of 
      the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of selective
      hemiepiphysiodesis of the healthy physis in the posteroinferior quadrant as a
      means of disrupting femoral head ovalization in cases of LCPD with the previous
      onset of ovalization. Methods: We performed a prospective study of 39 LCPD hips
      operated on consecutively by selective hemiepiphysiodesis of the posteroinferior 
      portion of the head during the reossification phase.Surgical indication was based
      on a progressive increase in the ellipsoidal index (EI), the presence of a double
      epiphyseal nucleus of reossification, physeal narrowing, and physeal angulation. 
      Hemiepiphysiodesis was performed at the mean patient age of 8.8 years (SD 1.5)
      and a mean of 4.7 years (SD 1.4) following disease onset. Results: Preoperative
      EI was 1.80 (SD 0.2), which was reduced to 1.72 (SD 0.2) postoperatively (P >
      0.05). Physeal angulation increased from 50 degrees preoperatively (SD 9.3) to
      54.29 degrees (SD 9.7) at the end of growth (P > 0.05). The final result
      according to the Stulberg classification revealed 20 class-II cases, 16 class
      III, and 3 class IV, and SDS was 25.97 (SD 9.95), range: 9.36-51.67. Conclusion: 
      As revealed by the EI, the ellipsoidal process may be stopped by selective
      hemiepiphysiodesis in the posteroinferior quadrant of the femoral head. Level of 
      Evidence: II.

TI  - Excision Versus Replacement in Unrepairable Comminuted Fractures of the Radial
      Head: A Systematic Review of Outcomes and Complications.
PG  - 1305-1315
LID - 10.1007/s43465-022-00645-0 [doi]
AB  - Background: The radial head fractures comprise approximately 4% of all fractures 
      around the elbow. The outcomes of open reduction and internal fixation are poor
      in fractures with more than three fragments, and the excision of radial head is
      considered a viable surgical treatment option. However, it is associated with its
      own set of complications. The radial head prosthetic replacement has emerged as
      an alternative in management of these fractures with constraints of cost and
      related complications. Hence, the treatment for the unrepairable comminuted
      radial head fractures still remains controversial. Aims and Objectives: This
      systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare the post-operative
      outcomes of the radial head excision versus prosthetic replacement in comminuted 
      Mason type-III fractures of radial head. Methodology: Three databases of Medline 
      (PubMed), Scopus, and Embase were searched for comparative studies on the study
      question and relevant studies which mentioned at least one of the outcomes of
      interest (functional outcome scores and number of complications) were included.
      Results: Six studies were part of this review with 82 excisions and 99 prosthetic
      replacements. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms
      of number of complications (OR 0.65; 0.08-5.07); and measures of functional
      outcomes; Mayo elbow performance score or MEPS (mean difference - 6.56; - 23.45
      to 10.33). The incidence of elbow osteoarthritis, heterotrophic ossification,
      stiffness, and instability were similar in both groups. The flexion extension arc
      in degrees was better in excision group (mean difference 9.93; 1.31-18.55; p =
      .02). Conclusion: Excision is a reasonable surgical option for isolated
      comminuted radial head fractures with similar results of function and associated 
      rates of complications as prosthetic replacements. The arc of motion is also
      better with excisions. There have been reports of more osteoarthritis with
      excision and arthroplasty has been advised in younger patients; however, we had
      no quantitative proof of that in this review.

      hypertensive patients: A prospective study.
PG  - 137-144
LID - 10.4103/picr.PICR_15_20 [doi]
AB  - Background: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic noncommunicable disease, and
      hypertension (HT) is the most common comorbidity which affects their quality of
      life (QoL). Aim: The aim of the study was to assess the effects of
      antihypertensive agents (viz., amlodipine, ramipril, telmisartan, and ramipril
      with telmisartan) on the blood pressure (BP) and QoL. Methodology: It was an
      open-labeled prospective intention-to-treat study done in diabetic hypertensive
      patients (CTRI/2016/10/007340). Patients were randomly assigned antihypertensive 
      agents, namely, amlodipine, ramipril, telmisartan, and a combination of ramipril 
      with telmisartan (RT) in four groups. They were evaluated for BP, blood sugar
      level, and QoL at baseline and 24(th) week. Results: After 24 weeks of therapy,
      systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were significantly reduced in all
      groups. In amlodipine, there was a mean percentage fall of SBP by 15.85%
      (confidence interval [CI]: 21.38-28.13) and DBP by 11.22% (CI: 8.41-12.70); in
      ramipril - 14.4% (CI: 18.61-25.15) and 12.4% (CI 8.88-13.99); telmisartan - 18.4%
      (CI: 24.89-10.79) and 14.6% (CI 10.79-16.24); and in RT group, SBP 17.7% (CI:
      23.38-29.18) and DBP 12.4% (CI: 9.05-13.02). QoL score increased by 30.56% (CI:
      14.30-10.90), 30.94% (CI: 14.21-10.68), 28.07% (CI: 14.89-11.20), and 28.84% (CI:
      15.49-11.77), in respective groups (P < 0.0001, each). However, they were
      nonsignificant between the study groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Amlodipine,
      ramipril, telmisartan, and a combination of RT are equally effective to improve
      BP and QoL among diabetic hypertensive patients. However, amlodipine and
      telmisartan lacked in dry cough and more tolerable than the ramipril and RT
      therapy. Henceforth, amlodipine and telmisartan are better choice to control HT
      among DM patients.

TI  - Development and Verification of Prognostic Prediction Models for Patients with
      Brain Trauma Based on Coagulation Function Indexes.
PG  - 3876805
LID - 10.1155/2022/3876805 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To assess the effect of adding coagulation indices to the currently
      existing prognostic prediction models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the
      prediction of outcome. Methods: A total of 210 TBI patients from 2017 to 2019 and
      131 TBI patients in 2020 were selected for development and internal verification 
      of the new model. The primary outcomes include death at 14 days and Glasgow
      Outcome Score (GOS) at 6 months. The performance of each model is evaluated by
      means of discrimination (area under the curve (AUC)), calibration
      (Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) goodness-of-fit test), and precision (Brier score).
      Results: The IMPACT Core model showed better prediction ability than the CRASH
      Basic model. Adding one coagulation index at a time to the IMPACT Core model, the
      new combined models IMPACT Core+FIB and IMPACT Core+APTT are optimal for the
      6-month unfavorable outcome and 6-month mortality, respectively (AUC, 0.830 and
      0.878). The new models were built based on the regression coefficients of the
      models. Internal verification indicated that for the prediction of 6-month
      unfavorable outcome and 6-month mortality, both the IMPACT Core+FIB model and the
      IMPACT Core+APTT model show better discrimination (AUC, 0.823 vs. 0.818 and 0.853
      vs. 0.837), better calibration (HL, p = 0.114 and p = 0.317) and higher precision
      (Brier score, 0.148 vs. 0.141 and 0.147 vs. 0.164), respectively, than the
      original models. Conclusion: Our research shows that the combination of the
      traumatic brain injury prognostic models and coagulation indices can improve the 
      6-month outcome prediction of patients with TBI.

TI  - Intravenous Thrombolysis Combined with Arterial Thrombolysis (Bridging Therapy)
      Effectively Improves Vascular Recanalization Rate in Patients with Cerebral
      Infarction.
PG  - 8295212
LID - 10.1155/2022/8295212 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To explore the efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis combined with
      arterial thrombolysis (bridging therapy) in patients with acute cerebral
      infarction and its effect on serum inflammatory factors. Methods: The case data
      of 138 patients with acute cerebral infarction admitted to our hospital from
      February 2019 to February 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the
      treatment plan they received, patients were assigned to two groups, namely, an
      observation group (n = 71) treated with bridging therapy and a control group (n =
      67) treated with intravenous thrombolysis alone. The following indexes were
      recorded and compared between the two groups: treatment efficacy, National
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, activities of daily living,
      incidence rates of vascular recanalization, intracranial hemorrhage and
      reembolization after treatment, levels of inflammatory factors before and after
      treatment, levels of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time
      (APTT) and fibrinogen (FIB) before and 1 week after treatment, and modified
      Rankin Scale scores 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Results: Compared with
      the control group, the therapeutic efficacy, neurological function, activities of
      daily living, and vascular recanalization were markedly better in the observation
      group (P > 0.05). In addition, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and
      reembolization was statistically lower in the observation group (P < 0.05). No
      marked difference was found between the two groups in terms of pretreatment serum
      inflammatory factors and coagulation function (P > 0.05), while the above
      indicators improved statistically after treatment in both groups, with
      comparatively more obvious improvement in the observation group. It was also
      observed that, compared with the control group, the modified Rankin Scale score
      in the observation group was significantly better at 3 and 6 months after
      treatment (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Bridging therapy can improve the vascular
      recanalization rate among patients suffering from acute cerebral infarction,
      reduce the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and reembolization, and improve
      the prognosis and neurological function of patients, which is worthy of clinical 
      application.

TI  - Association between comorbid cardiomyopathy and composite endpoints of patients
      with congestive heart failure in the intensive care unit: a retrospective cohort 
      study.
PG  - 2665-2676
LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-833 [doi]
AB  - Background: Congestive heart failure (HF) is a common condition in the intensive 
      care unit (ICU). Cardiomyopathy is an important etiological factor in HF.
      However, few studies have explored the effect of cardiomyopathy on the prognosis 
      of HF. This study explored the association between comorbid cardiomyopathy and
      the outcomes of critically ill patients with congestive HF. Methods: A
      retrospective cohort study was performed using data extracted from Medical
      Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. All adult patients
      with the first ICU admission were enrolled as participants but those diagnosed
      with cardiomyopathy alone were excluded. The demographics, comorbidities, vital
      signs, laboratory tests, scoring systems, and treatments of patients were
      extracted to further analyze. The composite endpoints included in-hospital
      mortality, cardiac arrest, and re-admission to the ICU. The association between
      cardiomyopathy comorbidity and the composite endpoints was assessed using
      propensity-score matching (PSM) and multivariable logistic regression models.
      Results: A total of 27,901 critically ill patients were enrolled, including 1,023
      patients diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and congestive HF. The average age of the 
      cohort was 64.37+/-17.36 years, and 58.13% of the patients were men. The
      ethnicity of patients was mainly white (64.67%). Multivariable logistic
      regression analyses found the risk of composite endpoints in patients with
      cardiomyopathy was higher than other groups [odds ratio (OR) =1.87; 95%
      confidence interval (CI): 1.62-2.15; P<0.001]. Compared to patients with
      congestive HF alone (OR =1.43; 95% CI: 1.26-1.62; P<0.001), patients with
      cardiomyopathy had a similar risk of in-hospital death (OR =1.35; 95% CI:
      1.06-1.71; P=0.014). Moreover, the risks of cardiac arrest (OR =1.53; 95% CI:
      1.01-2.34; P=0.029) and re-admission to the ICU (OR =1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.17;
      P<0.001) were both higher in patients with cardiomyopathy than other groups.
      After PSM, the risk of composite endpoints was still higher in patients with
      cardiomyopathy (OR =1.64; 95% CI: 1.33-2.02; P<0.001). The association was
      consistent among patients admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) and medical
      ICU (MICU)/surgical ICU (SICU). Conclusions: Comorbid cardiomyopathy increased
      the risk of composite endpoints in patients with congestive HF admitted to the
      ICU. Cardiomyopathy is related to the poor outcomes of critically ill patients
      with congestive HF.

TI  - Efficacy of the intraoperative opioid-sparing anesthesia on quality of patients' 
      recovery in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a randomized trial.
PG  - 2544-2555
LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-50 [doi]
AB  - Background: We aimed to explore the impact of opioid-sparing anesthesia on
      patients' quality of recovery after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). 
      We tested the primary hypothesis that our predefined opioid-sparing anesthesia
      provides better quality of patients' recovery compared to routine anesthesia in
      VATS. Methods: Patients between 18 and 70 years, scheduled for elective VATS, had
      an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-III under general
      anesthesia, were randomly allocated to: routine anesthesia group and
      opioid-sparing anesthesia group. Patients in the opioid-sparing anesthesia group 
      were mainly given preoperative thoracic paravertebral blockade with
      intraoperative withholding longer acting opioids. Patients in routine anesthesia 
      group received opioid-based anesthesia. The primary outcome was the Quality of
      Recovery-15 scale (QoR-15) at 6 hours after surgery. The secondary outcomes
      included QoR-15 at 24 and 48 hours after surgery, Overall Benefit of Analgesia
      Score Satisfaction with pain treatment (OBAS) and acute pain intensity at 6, 24
      and 48 hours after surgery, and clinical outcomes of recovery after surgery.
      Results: A total of 159 patients were included in final analysis. The median
      difference in QoR-15 between opioid-sparing anesthesia and routine anesthesia was
      4 (95% CI: 1-6) at 6 hours, 8 (95% CI: 4-12) at 24 hours and 4.7 (95% CI: 1-6) at
      48 hours after surgery respectively; 73.4% of patient showed good recovery in
      opioid-sparing anesthesia group, compared to 53.8% in routine anesthesia group at
      24 hours after surgery (P=0.01). Patients demonstrated lower OBAS in
      opioid-sparing anesthesia group compared to routine anesthesia at all time points
      after surgery (P<0.05). The pain at most was significantly lower in
      opioid-sparing anesthesia group compared to routine anesthesia at 6 and 48 hours 
      after surgery (P<0.05). Patients exhibited faster recovery with opioid-sparing
      anesthesia on time to mobilize and time to first flatus (P<0.01). Conclusions:
      Our intraoperative opioid-sparing anesthesia cannot improve patients' recovery at
      6 hours after VATS lung surgery, but it demonstrates better outcomes at 24 hours 
      after surgery compared to routine anesthesia, reaching to a clinically important 
      difference. Trial Registration: This study is registered in the Chinese Clinical 
      Trial Registry, ChiCTR2000031609.

TI  - Sarcopenia defined by skeletal muscle mass index at the third lumbar vertebra is 
      a prognostic factor for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer patients: a
      retrospective study.
PG  - 2645-2651
LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-782 [doi]
AB  - Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive types of 
      lung cancer and reliable indicators are needed for improved patient management.
      The evaluation of skeletal muscle index of the third lumbar vertebra (L3MI) based
      on computed tomography (CT) is used to estimate patient prognosis in multiple
      cancers. However, its function in extensive-stage SCLC remains controversial.
      Considering that the maintenance of muscle mass may affect the survival of cancer
      patients. Herein, a retrospective study was conducted to investigate whether
      sarcopenia defined by skeletal muscle mass index at the third lumbar vertebra is 
      a prognostic factor in extensive-stage SCLC cancer patients. Methods: This
      retrospective analysis included extensive-stage SCLC patients diagnosed at the
      Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from January 2009 to March 2017 with
      platinum-based chemotherapy. Clinical data were collated for further examination,
      and CT or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT datasets were analyzed for body
      mass index (BMI) and L3MI. Follow-up data were collected by contacting patients
      or their families. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between the 
      date of treatment started and the date of death or censoring. The Kaplan-Meier
      product limit method and log-rank tests were used to assess differences in OS
      between the high L3MI and low L3MI groups. Cox regression analysis was used to
      identify independent factors of OS. Results: For the 139 extensive-stage SCLC
      patients, the median follow-up time was 26.1 months (range, 0.4 to 79.4 months). 
      The median OS was 9.5 months. There were no differences in age, inflammatory
      factors, nor progression after first-line treatment between the high L3MI and low
      L3MI groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the OS of the high L3MI group was 
      significantly longer than that of the low L3MI group (14.045 vs. 9.985 months;
      P=0.007), and multivariate analysis identified high L3MI to be an independent
      prognostic factor for predicting longer OS in extensive-stage SCLC patients
      [hazard ratio (HR), 0.623; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.405-0.960; P=0.032].
      Conclusions: Sarcopenia defined by L3MI is a prognostic factor for
      extensive-stage SCLC patients and early intervention of muscle mass maintaining
      may achieve better cancer management.

AB  - Background: EH domain contains protein 2 (EHD2) may be involved in tumorigenesis 
      and development. However, the role of EHD2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is
      unknown. Methods: The link between EHD2 and LUAD and the associated underlying
      mechanism was determined using bioinformatics analysis. Then,
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to detect EHD2 expression level in LUAD
      patients. The stable transfection cell line was used to establish with lentivirus
      vector, and then the transfection efficiency was detected by western blot.
      Phagokinetic motility assays, transwell assays, and western blotting were also
      employed to investigate EHD2 impacts on cell viability. Results: The results
      indicated that EHD2 protein expression in human LUAD samples was significantly
      lower than that in the adjacent normal tissues. Low EHD2 expression was
      significantly linked to lymph node metastasis as well as advanced
      tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging (P<0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve
      showed that low EHD2 expression was significantly associated with low survival
      (P=0.01). The multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that EHD2 expression
      and TNM stage were independent prognostic factors for LUAD patients (all P<0.05).
      The in vitro experiments demonstrated that EHD2 knockdown markedly contributed to
      an increase in migration and invasion in A549 cells. Overexpression of EHD2
      substantially suppressed H1299 cell migration and invasion. Furthermore,
      decreased E-cadherin expression was observed in A549 cells with EHD2 knockdown,
      as well as increased N-cadherin and vimentin expressions. By contrast, E-cadherin
      expression was increased in H1299 cells, whereas N-cadherin and vimentin
      expressions were decreased as a result of EHD2 overexpression. Conclusions: Our
      study demonstrated that EHD2 reduces LUAD migration and invasion by preventing
      the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Furthermore, the results
      suggest that EHD2 may be a novel biomarker for prognosis prediction.

LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-133 [doi]
AB  - Background: This study aimed to establish nationwide data for the distributions
      of typical and atypical bacterial pathogens in Korean patients with moderate
      acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) and
      evaluate the clinical usefulness of a urinary antigen test (UAT) to detect
      Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methods: This study was a post hoc analysis of a
      randomized controlled trial designed to compare oral zabofloxacin with
      moxifloxacin for treating outpatients with moderate AECOPD. From clinics across
      South Korea, 342 subjects with AECOPD were enrolled, and their blood, sputum, and
      urine samples were collected at baseline. A serologic test, sputum culture and
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and UAT were performed to identify bacterial
      pathogens. Bacterial prevalence and regional distributions were analyzed. The
      patients' characteristics and clinical response between UAT-positive and
      UAT-negative groups were compared, as were the Streptococcus pneumoniae detection
      rates using conventional sputum culture and PCR versus UAT. Results: The most
      commonly isolated pathogen was Haemophilus influenzae (30.3%), followed by
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.0%), with no
      significant regional differences in bacterial distribution. Patients with
      positive UAT for Streptococcus pneumoniae showed no clinical failure when treated
      with respiratory quinolone (0.0%), whereas 11.8% of patients with negative UAT
      showed clinical failure (P=0.037). UAT showed moderate agreement with sputum
      culture by kappa coefficient (kappa=0.476). Conclusions: The bacterial prevalence
      in patients with moderate AECOPD in South Korea showed correlations with the
      global prevalence, without significant regional differences. In outpatient
      settings, UAT has the potential to be used as a supplemental tool with sputum
      culture as a guide for determining the suspicion of bacterial exacerbation.

TI  - Efficacy of low-dose corticosteroids in patients with acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome: a prospective observational study.
PG  - 2511-2521
LID - 10.21037/jtd-21-890 [doi]
AB  - Background: There is still no agreement on whether corticosteroids can reduce
      mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The aim of
      this study was to investigate the efficacy of low-dose corticosteroid
      administration in patients with ARDS. Methods: A prospective observational study 
      of patients with ARDS in 17 hospitals in China was performed between March 2016
      and February 2018. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for
      differences in baseline characteristics between different groups. The effects of 
      corticosteroids were assessed by using the Kaplan-Meier method and a multivariate
      Cox regression. Results: A total of 527 ARDS patients were enrolled in the study.
      Sixty-five patients (12.3%) were administered low-dose (methylprednisolone </=1
      mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) corticosteroids. The median dose was equivalent to 0.67
      (0.57-0.81) mg/kg methylprednisolone for a median duration of 10 days. The
      control group included 224 patients (42.5%) who had never receive
      corticosteroids. In the matched sample, the hospital mortality rates in the
      low-dose (n=40) and control groups (n=80) were 27.5% and 42.5% (P=0.110),
      respectively. The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the
      low-dose corticosteroid group than in the control group (24.0 vs. 17.0, P=0.002),
      and the multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the low-dose group
      had a significantly lower risk of death than the control group (HR: 0.48; 95% CI:
      0.24-0.97; P=0.040). Conclusions: The administration of low-dose corticosteroids 
      may reduce mortality in patients with ARDS.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to describe stereotactic body radiation 
      therapy (SBRT) use, outcomes, hospitalizations and costs compared to patients
      receiving chemotherapy among patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC). Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
      (SEER)-Medicare database, we identified patients aged >/=66 with metastatic NSCLC
      treated with SBRT as first-line treatment between 2004 and 2014. Multivariable
      logistic regression identified covariates associated with SBRT. Overall survival 
      (OS) between SBRT and chemotherapy was compared using the Kaplan-Meier estimator 
      and Cox proportional hazards regression. To compare hospitalizations and
      associated costs, we matched patients treated with SBRT to those with comparable 
      prognostic factors receiving chemotherapy. Results: We identified 215 patients
      with metastatic NSCLC who received SBRT and 12,486 patients who received
      chemotherapy as first-line treatment. SBRT use increased from 0.5% to 3% and was 
      associated with older age, female sex, poor disability status, and lower T- and
      N-stage. OS increased with SBRT, female sex, higher income and decreased with
      higher Charlson Comorbidity Score >/=2, poor disability status, higher T-stage
      and higher N-stage. Among a matched sample, SBRT patients underwent fewer
      hospitalizations vs. chemotherapy patients (73% vs. 81%, P=0.02). Among those
      hospitalized, SBRT patients incurred higher hospitalization costs ($33,063 vs.
      $23,865, P<0.001) but costs per month of survival were similar. Conclusions: SBRT
      is increasing among Medicare patients with metastatic NSCLC. Our findings suggest
      that SBRT may play a role in management of select metastatic NSCLC patients in
      addition to standard-of-care chemotherapy.

      application in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) immunochemotherapy
      remains unknown. Methods: Transcriptomic data for ESCC tissues and normal tissues
      and clinical materials of patients with ESCC were obtained from The Cancer Genome
      Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The differences in 
      mRNA levels in cancer tissues and noncancerous tissues were analyzed, and we
      subsequently investigated the association between miR-145-5p expression and the
      key parameters of ESCC progression and prognosis. Additionally, cytological
      experiments were performed to evaluate the biological functions of miR-145-5p.
      Pathways potentially affected by miR-145-5p were analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment 
      Analysis (GSEA) and REACTOME. We also analyzed the function of miR-145-5p in
      immune infiltration through the TIMER2 (Tumor Immune Estimation Resource)
      database. Results: The analysis of gene chip data from the TCGA database and GEO 
      database (including GSE13937 and GSE43732) showed that the expression of
      miR-145-5p is downregulated in ESCC (P<0.05) and that patients with high
      miR-145-5p levels had lower survival rates (P<0.05). The expression of miR-145-5p
      was significantly correlated with the disease-free survival (DFS) rate (P<0.05)
      and M stage (P<0.05) in the TCGA database and was significantly correlated with
      the T stage (P<0.05) and TNM stage (P<0.05) in the GSE13937 database. Functional 
      experiments showed that miR-145-5p attenuated proliferation (P<0.05), migration
      (P<0.01) and invasion (P<0.01) in the Eca109 cell line. Both GSEA gene enrichment
      and REACTOME gene enrichment revealed that miR-145-5p was associated with tumor
      signaling pathways and immune signaling pathways. Immune infiltration analysis
      revealed that the expression level of miR-145-5p was significantly correlated
      with the infiltration level of macrophages (P<0.05) and was positively correlated
      with the level of gene markers of M2 macrophages and tumor-associated macrophages
      (P<0.05). Conclusions: MiR-145-5p acts as a tumor suppressor microRNA in ESCC and
      is an important noncoding RNA in the high M2-like tumor-associated macrophage
      infiltration of ESCC. Assessing the miR-145-5p level in ESCC samples has
      translational meaning, which help illustrate the immune infiltration status,
      predict the prognostic outcome, and select the type of immunochemotherapy.

AB  - Background: Transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and vanilloid 1 
      (TRPV1) mediate the development of lung injury and inflammation. This study
      investigated the role and mechanism of the TRPA1/TRPV1 pathway in airway
      inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) induced by acute ozone
      exposure. Methods: C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks) were intraperitoneally injected with
      phosphate buffered saline (PBS), A967079 (TRPA1 inhibitor) or AMG9810 (TRPV1
      inhibitor) 1 h before or after ozone exposure (2.5 ppm, 3 h). BHR, cell counts in
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, oxidative stress biomarkers, inflammatory
      cytokines, TRPA1 and TPRV1 protein levels, mitochondrial dynamics- and
      mitophagy-related protein levels, and activities of mitochondrial respiratory
      chain (MRC) in lung were measured. Results: The preventive treatment effect was
      similar to the therapeutic treatment effect. Both A967079 and AMG9810
      intervention suppressed BHR, inflammatory cytokines, total BAL fluid cells,
      malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and inflammatory cytokines mRNA including Substance 
      P (SP), Keratinocyte-Derived Chemokine (KC), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and chemokine
      (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8) expression, and enhanced reduced glutathione
      (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels compared with ozone-exposed mice.
      A967079 and AMG9810 intervention inhibited dynamin-related protein (DRP1),
      mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), Parkinson protein 2 E3 ubiquitin protein
      ligase (PARK2) and Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)/p62 expression, increased Optic
      atrophy 1 (OPA1), mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)
      expression, and up-regulated the activities of MRC complex III and V in lung
      tissue. Conclusions: The results show that both TRPA1 and TRPV1 pathways are
      involved in acute ozone exposure-induced airway inflammation and BHR and
      influence oxidative stress, mitochondrial quality control and MRC activity, which
      could be a potential target for clinical therapy of respiratory diseases.

TI  - Identification of hub genes and their correlation with immune infiltration in
      coronary artery disease through bioinformatics and machine learning methods.
PG  - 2621-2634
LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-632 [doi]
AB  - Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a multifactorial disease and its
      pathogenesis remains unclear. We aimed to explore the optimal feature genes
      (OFGs) for CAD and to investigate the function of immune cell infiltration of
      CAD. It will be helpful for better understanding of the pathogenesis and the
      development of genetic prediction of CAD. Methods: Datasets related to CAD were
      obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Cases from the datasets
      met diagnostic criteria including clinical symptoms, electrocardiographic (ECG)
      and angiographic evidence. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
      and conducted functional enrichment analysis. OFGs were obtained from the least
      absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, support vector
      machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm, and random forest (RF)
      algorithm. CIBERSORT was used to compare immune infiltration between CAD patients
      and normal controls, and the correlation between OFGs and immune cells was
      analyzed. Results: DEGs were involved in the interleukin (IL)-17 signaling
      pathway, nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B signaling pathway, and tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) signaling pathway. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed DEGs were enriched 
      in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tertiary granule, and pattern recognition receptor
      activity. Disease Ontology (DO) analysis suggested DEGs were enriched in lung
      disease, arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Matrix metalloproteinase 
      9 (MMP9), Pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (PELI1), thrombomodulin (THBD),
      and zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36) were screened by the intersection of OFGs
      obtained from LASSO, SVM-REF, and RF algorithms. CAD patients had a lower
      proportion of memory B cells (P=0.019), CD8 T cells (P<0.001), resting memory CD4
      T cells (P<0.001), regulatory T cells (P=0.028), and gamma delta T cells
      (P<0.001) than normal controls, while the proportion of activated memory CD4 T
      cells (P=0.014), resting natural killer (NK) cells (P<0.001), monocytes
      (P<0.001), M0 macrophages (P=0.023), activated mast cells (P<0.001), and
      neutrophils (P<0.001) in CAD patients were higher than normal controls. MMP9,
      PELI1, THBD, and ZFP36 were correlated with immune cells. Conclusions: MMP9,
      PELI1, THBD, and ZFP36 may be predicted biomarkers for CAD. The OFGs and
      association between OFGs and immune infiltration may provide potential biomarkers
      for CAD prediction along with the better assessment of the disease.

PG  - 2461-2471
LID - 10.21037/jtd-21-1782 [doi]
AB  - Background: Transcatheter closure of inferior sinus venosus defect (ISVD) is
      still contraindication. To explore whether transcatheter closure with patent
      ductus arteriosus (PDA) occluders is possible for ISVD. Methods: From June 2014
      to March 2021, 12 patients were recruited diagnosed as <25 mm ISVD. The
      three-dimensional printing (3DP) heart model was produced based on multi-slice
      computed tomography (MSCT) scans. Preoperative closure simulation was planned on 
      the personalized 3D model for each patient. Follow-up including
      electrocardiography (ECG), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and X-ray was
      traced. Results: 3DP models of 12 patients were successfully printed. Twelve
      patients had been diagnosed with <25 mm ISVD and 4 of them had another secundum
      atrial septal defect (ASD). All patients were produced interventional therapy
      successfully. PDA occluder was implanted to closed ISVD, and ASD was closed using
      ASD occluder simultaneously. The average diameter of ISVD measured by TTE was
      (12.67+/-3.80), and the average diameter of sagittal axes and longitudinal axes
      measured by the 3D-printed model was (17.08+/-3.20) and (18.42+/-4.62) mm,
      respectively. The average size of PDA (diameter of pulmonary artery side) was
      (28.17+/-3.35) mm. Compared with the preoperative, the X-ray cardiothoracic ratio
      (0.51+/-0.04 vs. 0.47+/-0.06, P=0.007) and the right ventricle anterior-posterior
      diameter (31.17+/-5.65 vs. 24.58+/-3.75 mm, P<0.001) of postoperative was
      significantly decreased. During the average (47.75+/-27.52) months follow-up, it 
      has achieved satisfying results, and there were no severe adverse events such as 
      device transposition, death, and pericardial tamponade occurred. Conclusions:
      Assisting by 3D heart model, transcatheter closure of ISVD with PDA occluder had 
      an excellent outcome. This method provides a new considerable treatment strategy 
      for ISVD.

TI  - Study on the predictive ability of emergency CHADS2 score and CHA2DS2-VASc score 
      for coronary artery disease and prognosis in patients with acute ST-segment
      elevation myocardial infarction.
PG  - 2611-2620
LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-763 [doi]
AB  - Background: Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has a high
      morbidity and mortality rate. The congestive heart failure, hypertension, age,
      diabetes, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack (2 points) (CHADS2) and
      CHADS2 score with 2 points assigned for age >75 years-vascular disease
      (CHA2DS2-VASc) scores are widely used for risk stratification management of
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation stroke and have high prognostic value in
      cardiovascular disease. This study aims to investigate the predictive value of
      the emergency CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc score on coronary artery lesions and
      prognosis in patients with acute STEMI. Methods: A total of 524 patients with
      STEMI from May 2018 to October 2021 were selected for emergency CHADS2 and
      CHA2DS2-VASc. Clinical data and laboratory indicators were collected. Patients
      were evaluated for coronary artery disease (CAD) and prognosis. Logistic
      regression and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to
      analyze the data. Results: In severe group, CysC levels, CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc
      score and the proportion of diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), 
      congestive heart failure, smoking history, Killip class >/=2 was higher than that
      in mild and moderate group. In poor prognosis group, levels of serum creatinine
      (Crea), CysC, hemoglobin (Hb), CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc score and the proportion of
      hypertension, diabetes, stroke or TIA, congestive heart failure, smoking history,
      and Killip class >/=2 was higher than that in good prognosis group. Diabetes (OR,
      3.678; 95% CI: 2.876-5.872, 0.008), CHADS2 (OR, 3.829; 95% CI: 2.310-5.832,
      0.003) and CHA2DS2-VASc score (OR, 4.671; 95% CI: 3.125-6.187, 0.000) were
      independent risk factors for the severity of CAD (P<0.05). Diabetes (OR, 3.287;
      95% CI: 2.231-5.123, 0.012), Killip class >/=2 (OR, 2.212; 95% CI: 1.023-2.987,
      0.045), LVEF (OR, 3.110; 95% CI: 2.124-5.031, 0.023), CHADS2 (OR, 3.228; 95% CI: 
      2.133-5.886, 0.005) and CHA2DS2-VASc score (OR, 3.988; 95% CI: 2.987-5.873,
      0.001) were independent risk factors for prognosis of acute STEMI patients. Area 
      under curve (AUC) value of CHA2DS2-VASc score in evaluating CAD and prognosis was
      0.947, 0.931, higher than that of the CHADS2 score (0.836, 0.812) (P<0.05).
      Conclusions: Multiple factors jointly affect the severity and prognosis of CAD in
      patients with acute STEMI. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is better than the CHADS2 score
      in predicting the severity of coronary artery lesions and prognosis of patients, 
      providing theoretical support for clinical practice.

AB  - Background: Postoperative fluid management plays a key role in providing adequate
      tissue perfusion, stabilizing hemodynamics, and reducing morbidities related to
      hemodynamics. This study evaluated the dose-response relationship between
      postoperative 24-hour intravenous fluid volume and postoperative outcomes in
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing video-assisted
      thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. Methods: A retrospective analysis of
      adult patients with NSCLC undergoing VATS lobectomy between May 2016 and April
      2017 was performed. The primary exposure variable was total intravenous
      crystalloid infusion in the 24-hour postoperative period. The observation
      outcomes were postoperative pulmonary complications, acute kidney injury (AKI),
      in-hospital mortality, readmission within 30 days, prolonged hospital stay,
      postoperative length of stay, and total hospital care costs. Univariate and
      multivariate analyses were performed. Results: Of the 563 patients, 136 (24.2%)
      with pulmonary complications were observed. Binary logistics regression showed
      that, relative to the group with moderate postoperative 24-hour crystalloid
      infusion, the risk for postoperative pulmonary complications was significantly
      increased in the restrictive [odds ratio (OR) 1.815, 95% CI: 1.083-3.043;
      P=0.024] and liberal (OR 2.692, 95% CI: 1.684-4.305; P<0.001) groups.
      Conclusions: In patients with NSCLC undergoing VATS lobectomy, both restrictive
      and liberal 24-hour postoperative crystalloid infusions were related to adverse
      effects on postoperative outcomes and the optimal volume of 24-hour postoperative
      intravenous crystalloid infusion was 1,080-<1,410 mL.

TI  - Comparison of efficacy and safety of hybrid video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery 
      vs. thoracotomy sleeve lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer: a propensity
      score matching study.
PG  - 2635-2644
LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-754 [doi]
AB  - Background: It is unclear whether hybrid video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
      (VATS) sleeve lobectomy (SL) could be an alternative to thoracotomy SL for
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. The aim of the study is to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of hybrid VATS SL. Methods: We collected 112 
      patients who received hybrid VATS SL or thoracotomy SL for primary treatment of
      NSCLC at Liaoning Cancer Hospital & Institute from November 2016 to September
      2021. Perioperative and survival data were collected, and retrospective analysis 
      was conducted on 91 thoracotomy and 21 hybrid VATS SL patients to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of two approaches. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used
      to minimize selection bias. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to compare
      overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Follow-up data were
      obtained by outpatient clinical visit and nurse-led telephone. Results: A total
      of 112 patients were included in this study, including thoracotomy patients
      (n=91) and hybrid VATS patients (n=21). In the non-match analysis, the baseline
      data of patients was similar between the two groups, except regarding the receipt
      of neoadjuvant therapy (P=0.087). After PSM (2:1), a total of 39 thoracotomy
      patients and 19 hybrid VATS patients were enrolled. The baseline variables were
      quite similar in both groups. In the hybrid group, the number of lymph nodes
      (25.9+/-8.5 vs. 32.9+/-9.7, P<0.01) and positive lymph nodes (3.7+/-2.9 vs.
      5.6+/-4.0, P=0.045) were significantly higher than those in the thoracotomy
      group. The hybrid group was associated with significantly shorter postoperative
      hospital stay (9.5+/-3.5 vs. 7.3+/-2.9, P=0.021) and chest tube duration time
      (6.6+/-3.1 vs. 5.3+/-1.5, P=0.031). No statistical difference in complications,
      reoperation, and recurrence were observed between the hybrid VATS SL and
      thoracotomy SL (P=1.0, P=1.0, P=0.472). The 30- and 90-day mortalities showed no 
      differences between approaches (2.6% vs. 0%, P=1.0; 5.1% vs. 5.3%, P=1.0). No
      significant differences were found between thoracotomy and hybrid VATS SL in
      3-year OS (P=0.614) and 3-year RFS (P=0.750). Conclusions: Hybrid VATS SL
      lobectomy may be a safe and feasible approach associated with similar oncologic
      prognosis and better postoperative recovery compared with thoracotomy SL for
      NSCLC treatment.

TI  - CaFE: A Sensitive, Low-Cost Filtration Method for Detecting Polioviruses and
      Other Enteroviruses in Residual Waters.
LID - 10.3389/fenvs.2022.914387 [doi]
AB  - Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance has been used to identify polio cases 
      and target vaccination campaigns since the inception of the Global Poliovirus
      Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988. To date, only Afghanistan and Pakistan
      have failed to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission. Circulation of
      vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) continues to be a problem in high-risk areas 
      of the Eastern Mediterranean, African, and Southeast Asian regions. Environmental
      surveillance (ES) is an important adjunct to AFP surveillance, helping to
      identify circulating polioviruses in problematic areas. Stools from AFP cases and
      contacts (>200,000 specimens/year) and ES samples (>642 sites) are referred to
      146 laboratories in the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) for testing.
      Although most World Health Organization supported laboratories use the two-phase 
      separation method due to its simplicity and effectiveness, alternative simple,
      widely available, and cost-effective methods are needed. The CAFE (Concentration 
      and Filtration Elution) method was developed from existing filtration methods to 
      handle any type of sewage or residual waters. At $10-20 US per sample for
      consumable materials, CAFE is cost effective, and all equipment and reagents are 
      readily available from markets and suppliers globally. The report describes the
      results from a parallel study of CAFE method with the standard two-phase
      separation method. The study was performed with samples collected from five
      countries (Guatemala, Haiti, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines),
      run in three laboratories-(United States, Thailand and in the Philippines) to
      account for regional and sample-to-sample variability. Samples from each site
      were divided into two 500 ml aliquots and processed by both methods, with no
      other additional concentration or manipulation. The results of 338
      parallel-tested samples show that the CAFE method is more sensitive than the
      two-phase separation method for detection of non-polio enteroviruses (p-value <
      0.0001) and performed as well as the two-phase separation method for polioviruses
      detection with no significant difference (p-value > 0.05). The CAFE method is a
      robust, sensitive, and cost-effective method for isolating enteroviruses from
      residual waters.

AB  - Epidemiologic evidence documenting risk of chronic diseases as children with
      cerebral palsy age throughout growth is lacking to inform prevention strategies. 
      The objective was to characterize the 5-year risk of chronic diseases that are
      typically associated with advanced aging among < 1-13 year olds with cerebral
      palsy and effects by patient-level factors. This retrospective cohort study used 
      nationwide commercial administrative claims from 01/01/2001-12/31/2018 from
      children < 1-13 years old with >/= 5 years of mostly continuous insurance
      enrollment. The 5-year risk of chronic diseases was examined for the entire
      cohort with and without cerebral palsy and then by baseline age group (<1-2, 3-5,
      6-8, 9-11, 12-13 years old), including cardiorespiratory, metabolic, kidney, and 
      liver diseases, cancer, depression, and osteoarthritis. For cerebral palsy, the
      association between 5-year chronic disease rate and patient-level factors was
      assessed using Cox regression. Children with (n = 5,559) vs without (n = 2.3
      million) cerebral palsy had a higher 5-year risk of all chronic diseases when
      comparing the entire cohorts (relative risk, 1.19 to 64.26, all P < 0.05) and
      most chronic diseases when comparing cohorts for each age group. Among children
      with cerebral palsy, there were effects by gender, co-occurring intellectual
      disabilities and/or epilepsy, and wheelchair use for some chronic diseases, which
      can help to identify at-risk children. This study provides novel epidemiologic
      evidence of 5-year risk of "adult-onset" chronic diseases for children with
      cerebral palsy during important developmental stages, and associated
      patient-level factors (to enhance clinical detection). Findings may inform when
      to implement prevention strategies and who may be more at risk.

TI  - Exercise Intervention Modulates Synaptic Plasticity by Inhibiting Excessive
      Microglial Activation via Exosomes.

LID - 10.3389/fncel.2022.953640 [doi]
AB  - Background: Exosomes can activate microglia to modulate neural activity and
      synaptic plasticity by phagocytosis of neural spines or synapses. Our previous
      research found that an early 4-week exercise intervention in middle cerebral
      artery occlusion (MCAO) rats can promote the release of exosomes and protect the 
      brain. This study intended to further explore the intrinsic mechanism of
      neuroprotection by exosome release after exercise. Methods: Rats were randomly
      divided into four groups: the sham operation (SHAM), middle cerebral artery
      occlusion (MCAO) with sedentary intervention (SED-MCAO), MCAO with exercise
      intervention (EX-MCAO), and MCAO with exercise intervention and exosome injection
      (EX-MCAO-EXO). Modified neurological severity score (mNSS), cerebral infarction
      volume ratio, microglial activation, dendritic complexity, and expression of
      synaptophysin (Syn) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) were detected
      after 28 days of intervention. Results: (1) The exercise improved body weight and
      mNSS score, and the survival state of the rats after exosome infusion was better.
      (2) Compared with the SED-MCAO group, the EX-MCAO (P = 0.039) and EX-MCAO-EXO
      groups (P = 0.002) had significantly lower cerebral infarct volume ratios (P <
      0.05), among which the EX-MCAO-EXO group had the lowest (P = 0.031). (3) Compared
      with the SED-MCAO group, the EX-MCAO and EX-MCAO-EXO groups had a significantly
      decreased number of microglia (P < 0.001) and significantly increased process
      length/cell (P < 0.01) and end point/cell (P < 0.01) values, with the EX-MCAO-EXO
      group having the lowest number of microglia (P = 0.036) and most significantly
      increased end point/cell value (P = 0.027). (4) Compared with the SED-MCAO group,
      the total number of intersections and branches of the apical and basal dendrites 
      in the EX-MCAO and EX-MCAO-EXO groups was increased significantly (P < 0.05), and
      the increase was more significant in the EX-MCAO-EXO group (P < 0.05). (5) The
      expression levels of Syn and PSD-95 in the EX-MCAO (P Syn = 0.043, P PSD-95 =
      0.047) and EX-MCAO-EXO groups were significantly higher than those in the
      SED-MCAO group (P < 0.05), and the expression levels in the EX-MCAO-EXO group
      were significantly higher than those in the EX-MCAO group (P < 0.05). Conclusion:
      Early exercise intervention after stroke can inhibit the excessive activation of 
      microglia and regulate synaptic plasticity by exosome release.

      control in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients: A randomized controlled crossover
      trial.
PG  - 902903
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.902903 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether a single bout of mixed circuit training (MCT) 
      can elicit acute blood pressure (BP) reduction in chronic hemiparetic stroke
      patients, a phenomenon also known as post-exercise hypotension (PEH). Methods:
      Seven participants (58 +/- 12 years) performed a non-exercise control session
      (CTL) and a single bout of MCT on separate days and in a randomized
      counterbalanced order. The MCT included 10 exercises with 3 sets of 15-repetition
      maximum per exercise, with each set interspersed with 45 s of walking. Systolic
      (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac
      output (Q), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and
      heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed 10 min before and 40 min after CTL and
      MCT. BP and HRV were also measured during an ambulatory 24-h recovery period.
      Results: Compared to CTL, SBP (-22%), DBP (-28%), SVR (-43%), BRS (-63%), and
      parasympathetic activity (HF; high-frequency component: -63%) were reduced during
      40 min post-MCT (p < 0.05), while Q (35%), sympathetic activity (LF;
      low-frequency component: 139%) and sympathovagal balance (LF:HF ratio: 145%) were
      higher (p < 0.001). In the first 10 h of ambulatory assessment, SBP (-7%), MAP
      (-6%), and HF (-26%) remained lowered, and LF (11%) and LF:HF ratio (13%)
      remained elevated post-MCT vs. CTL (p < 0.05). Conclusion: A single bout of MCT
      elicited prolonged PEH in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients. This occurred
      concurrently with increased sympathovagal balance and lowered SVR, suggesting
      vasodilation capacity is a major determinant of PEH in these patients. This
      clinical trial was registered in the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry
      (RBR-5dn5zd), available at https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-5dn5zd. Clinical

TI  - Effects of Lecithin Supplementation in Feed of Different fat Levels on Serum
      Indexes and Liver Health of Laying Hens.
PG  - 892585
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.892585 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effect of soy lecithin on
      serum-related indicators and liver health in laying hens under the influence of
      high-fat diets. 180 peak laying hens at 40 weeks of age were randomly assigned to
      one of the four diets using a 2 x 2 factorial and fed for 5 weeks. The results
      showed that compared to the low-fat group, the high-fat group had lower egg
      production (p < 0.05) and higher average daily feed intake and feed-to-egg ratio 
      (p < 0.05). At the 21(st) day, the serum levels of triglyceride (TC) and
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) were higher (p < 0.05), high-density lipoproteins
      cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were lower (p < 0.01), catalase (CAT) activity was
      lower (p < 0.05), TC and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in liver were higher (p <
      0.01) and SOD activity in liver was lower (p < 0.05) in layers supplemented with 
      soy lecithin. CAT activity in serum was increased (p < 0.01) and total
      antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activity in the liver was decreased (p < 0.05) after
      increasing the dietary fat concentration. The addition of soy lecithin and the
      increase in dietary fat concentration had a highly significant interaction on
      serum CAT activity and liver TC content in layers (p < 0.01). At the 35(th) day, 
      the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was higher (p < 0.01), serum
      glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and CAT activity were higher (p < 0.05), and
      serum triglyceride (TG) content and total T-AOC capacity activity were lower (p <
      0.05) in layers supplemented with soy lecithin. Increasing dietary fat
      concentration decreased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST) and GSH-Px activity in serum (p < 0.05). However, it
      increased TG and MDA content in liver (p < 0.05), and highly decreased SOD
      content in liver (p < 0.01) in layers. The addition of soy lecithin and
      increasing dietary fat concentration had a highly significant reciprocal effect
      on serum ALT viability and CAT viability (p < 0.01) and liver TG and MDA content 
      and SOD viability (p < 0.05) in layers. In conclusion, feeding high-fat diets
      will adversely affect the laying performance of laying hens, while long-term
      addition of lecithin can improve the blood lipids and liver lipids of laying
      hens, enhance the antioxidant capacity of the liver, and maintain liver health.

TI  - Unveiling the Angiotensin-(1-7) Actions on the Urinary Bladder in Female Rats.
PG  - 920636
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.920636 [doi]
AB  - Angiotensin-(1-7) is a peptide produced by different pathways, and regardless of 
      the route, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is involved in one of the 
      steps of its synthesis. Angiotensin-(1-7) binds to Mas receptors localized in
      different cells throughout the body. Whether angiotensin-(1-7) exerts any action 
      in the urinary bladder (UB) is still unknown. We investigated the effects of
      intravenous and topical (in situ) administration of angiotensin-(1-7) on
      intravesical pressure (IP) and cardiovascular variables. In addition, the Mas
      receptors and ACE-2 gene and protein expression were analyzed in the UB. Adult
      female Wistar rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in 100% O2 and submitted 
      to the catheterization of the femoral artery and vein for mean arterial pressure 
      (MAP) and heart rate (HR) recordings, and infusion of drugs, respectively. The
      renal blood flow was acquired using a Doppler flow probe placed around the left
      renal artery and the renal conductance (RC) was calculated as a ratio of Doppler 
      shift (kHz) and MAP. The cannulation of the UB was performed for IP recording. We
      observed that angiotensin-(1-7) either administered intravenously [115.8 +/-
      28.6% angiotensin-(1-7) vs. -2.9 +/- 1.3% saline] or topically [147.4 +/- 18.9%
      angiotensin-(1-7) vs. 3.2 +/- 2.8% saline] onto the UB evoked a significant (p < 
      0.05) increase in IP compared to saline and yielded no changes in MAP, HR, and
      RC. The marked response of angiotensin-(1-7) on the UB was also investigated
      using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting
      assay, which demonstrated the mRNA and protein expression of Mas receptors in the
      bladder, respectively. ACE-2 mRNA and protein expression was also observed in the
      bladder. Therefore, the findings demonstrate that angiotensin-(1-7) acts in the
      UB to increase the IP and suggest that this peptide can be also locally
      synthesized in the UB.

      II obesity (BMI >/=30kg/m(2)) and non-obesity (BMI<30kg/m(2)) were compared.
      Clinical characteristics of people with BMI>50kg/m(2) were assessed. Results: 504
      patients were included. Obesity was strongly over-represented in young SCD
      compared to the age-matched general population (55.0% vs 28.7%, p<0.0001). Obese 
      SCD patients more frequently had hypertension, diabetes and obstructive sleep
      apnoea (p<0.0001, p=0.009 and p=0.001 respectively), ventricular fibrillation as 
      their arrest rhythm (p=0.008) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (p<0.0001). 
      Obese patients were less likely to have toxicology positive for illicit
      substances (22.0% vs 32.6%, p=0.008) or history of alcohol abuse (18.8% vs 26.9%,
      p=0.030). Patients with BMI>50 kg/m(2) represented 8.5% of young SCD. LVH (n=26, 
      60.5%) was their predominant cause of death and only 10 (9.3%) patients died from
      coronary disease. Conclusion: Over half of young Australian SCD patients are
      obese, with all obesity classes over-represented compared to the general
      population. Obese patients had more cardiac risk factors. Almost two thirds of
      patients with BMI>50 kg/m(2) died from LVH, with fewer than 10% dying from
      coronary disease.

TI  - Preoperative Surgical Site Hair Removal for Elective Abdominal Surgery: Does It
      Have Impact on Surgical Site Infection.
PG  - e179-e186
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1749425 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) forms the major burden
      of nosocomial infections in surgical patients. There is prevalent practice of
      surgical site hair shaving as a part of preoperative preparation. There is
      uncertainty regarding the benefit versus harm of shaving for SSIs. Hairs at
      surgical sites are removed prior to surgery most often by shaving. We performed
      this study to look for what impact preoperative hair removal by shaving has on
      postoperative SSI. Methods We performed prospective comparative cohort study in
      patients undergoing elective abdominal surgeries. We included clean and
      clean-contaminated surgeries in immunocompetent patients of which half were
      shaved and other half not shaved prior to surgery. Other confounding factors like
      skin cleaning, aseptic technique of surgery, antibiotic prophylaxis and
      treatment, and postoperative wound care were as per care. Patients were assessed 
      for presence and grade of SSI postoperatively on day 7, 14, and 30. Results were 
      analyzed statistically using chi-square and Fischer's exact tests for
      significance in entire sample as well as in demographic subgroups. Results
      Overall SSI rate was 11.42%. There was no statistically significant difference in
      SSI rates between patients who underwent preoperative surgical site hair removal 
      by shaving (232) and who did not have shaving (232) on all the three different
      assessment timelines in postoperative period, namely, day 7, 14, and 30. Although
      the absolute number of patients who had SSI was more in those who underwent
      preoperative surgical site hair removal by shaving, the difference was not
      statistically significant ( p > 0.05). But on subgroup analysis patients with
      clean-contaminated surgeries ( p = 0.037) and patients with surgeries lasting for
      less than 2 hours (Fischer's exact = 0.034) had significantly higher SSI in the
      shaved group compared with unshaved on day 14. Conclusion As per our results,
      preoperative shaving did not significantly increase overall SSI except in
      subgroup of clean-contaminated surgeries and in surgeries of less than 2 hours'
      duration. So especially in these patients avoiding preoperative surgical site
      hair shaving may be used as one of the infection control measures.

TI  - A Comparative Study between Peptic Ulcer Perforation Score, Mannheim Peritonitis 
      Index, ASA Score, and Jabalpur Score in Predicting the Mortality in Perforated
      Peptic Ulcers.
PG  - e162-e168
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1743526 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Peptic ulcer disease continues to be a major public health in most
      developing countries despite the advances in medical management. The incidence of
      perforations remains high and has the highest mortality rate of any complication 
      of ulcer disease. Risk stratification of cases will lead to better preoperative
      management and efficient utilization of intensive care unit resources. The
      purpose of the present study is to compare different existing scoring systems and
      identify the most accurate predictor of mortality in perforated peptic ulcer
      (PPU) cases. Materials and Methods This is an observational study conducted in
      Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences, Hubli, India. All cases of PPU disease
      admitted from December 2017 to August 2019 who were treated surgically were
      included in the study. Demographic data were collected and peptic ulcer
      perforation (PULP) score, Mannheim peritonitis index (MPI), American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, and Jabalpur score (JS) were calculated for
      individual patient and compared. The patient was followed up during the
      postoperative period. Observation A total of 45 patients were included in the
      study with a mean age of 42.5 years. Most of the patients presented with 24 hours
      of the onset of symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use was noted in
      8.9% patients, and steroid use was present in 2.2% patients. Of the 45 patients, 
      7 deaths were reported. Between the various scoring systems, the MPI and JS were 
      better predictors of mortality with a p -value of <0.001 and 0.007, respectively.
      In contrast, the PULP and ASA scores had p -value not statistically significant. 
      However, the PULP score was a better predictor of postoperative complication with
      a p -value of 0.047. Conclusion Of the four scoring systems validated, the MPI
      and JS were better predictors of mortality in the given population. PULP score is
      a better predictor of postoperative complications in the present study.

TI  - Routine Screening for Sickle Cell Disease during Pregnancy: Epidemiological and
      Haemoglobin Profile in Congo.
LID - 1000335 [pii]
AB  - Sickle-cell disease, a genetic condition with a high prevalence in sub-Saharan
      Africa, is transmitted in an autosomal recessive mode. Its screening during
      pregnancy makes it possible to identify carriers of the S gene which constitute a
      risk for the unborn child. In order to promote the use of immuno-chromatographic 
      tests, we have set ourselves the task of establishing the epidemiological profile
      and determining the Emmel test performance. Analytical cross-sectional study of
      three months duration carried out in the 12 departments of Congo in pregnant
      women, from 12 weeks of amenorrhea, Admitted for Antenatal Consultation (ANC).
      The studied variables were epidemiological, Emmel test and immuno-chromatographic
      profile of haemoglobin. 782 pregnant women screened, of which 27.88% were AS
      sickle cell trait and 1.79% homozygous SS. The median age of sickle cell patients
      was 29 years vs. 25 years (p=0.10). High education level, married status, history
      of transfusion and sickle cell disease, and high ANC number were more common in
      pregnant sickle cell patients (p<0.05).The frequency of sickle cell trait ranged 
      from 16.67 to 31.17% and homozygous forms from 0 to 66.67% depending on the
      department. The sensitivity and specificity of the Emmel test were 46% and 99%
      with PPV and NPV of 95% and 81% respectively. Sickle cell disease carriage, which
      is high in both forms, is more often of interest to young, educated, married
      pregnant women and follow-up by health personnel other than the doctor in rural
      areas.

TI  - Timing of Exposure to ICU Diaries and Its Impact on Mental Health, Memories, and 
      Quality of Life: A Double-Blind Randomized Control Trial.
PG  - e0742
LID - 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000742 [doi]
AB  - Optimal time for ICU diary delivery and impact on mental health (MH),
      anxiety-depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), quality of life (QOL),
      and memories is unclear. We evaluated the effect of ICU diaries, dispatched at
      different time points, on outcomes in an Indian cohort. DESIGN: Double-blind
      randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A 1,000-bedded teaching hospital in East
      India. PATIENTS: Mechanically ventilated (>24 hr) adults were recruited,
      excluding those dead or incapable of meaningful-communication at discharge or
      follow-up. Eighty-three patients, aged 46.2 +/- 17.2 years, Acute Physiology and 
      Chronic Health Evaluation II scores 13.7 +/- 4.9 were assessed. Length of ICU
      stay was 8.2 +/- 7.1 days with 3.7 +/- 3.2 ventilator days. INTERVENTION: Of 820 
      screened, 164 had diaries created. Including photographs, diaries were
      comaintained by healthcare workers and family members. Ninety patients were
      randomized at 1-month follow-up: diary sent to 45 at 1 month (group ID1) and to
      45 at 3 months (ID3). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Anxiety-depression, memory, 
      and QOL were assessed telephonically or home visits by a psychologist using the
      Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale (HADS) and other tools at ICU discharge,
      1-month (prerandomization), and 3 months of discharge. ID3 was reassessed after
      receiving diaries at 3.5 months. Primary outcome was anxiety-depression;
      secondary outcomes included PTSS, QOL, and memories. There was 100% follow-up. At
      3 months, ID1 patients had a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in HADS from
      baseline when compared with ID3 that had not received diaries (4.16 +/- 2.9 vs
      2.15 +/- 1.8; 95% CI, 2.8-1.2). PTSS scores were likewise better (p < 0.001). ID3
      patients demonstrated significant improvement (p < 0.01) in QOL and memories
      along with HADS and PTSS when assessed at 3.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: ICU diaries
      improve MH but not QOL when delivered at 1 month and assessed 2 months
      thereafter. Assessed after 15 days, delayed exposure at 3 months significantly
      improved QOL and memories in addition to MH.

TI  - Hepatitis C Virus Reinfection in People With HIV in Taiwan After Achieving
      Sustained Virologic Response With Antiviral Treatment: The RECUR Study.
PG  - ofac348
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofac348 [doi]
AB  - Background: Data on hepatitis C virus (HCV) reinfection in East Asian people with
      HIV after treatment-induced sustained virologic response (SVR) are limited.
      Methods: HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in Taiwan who achieved SVR12 with interferon
      (IFN) or direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) between 2005 and 2021 underwent HCV RNA 
      measurements at SVR24 and then biannually. HCV reinfection was defined as the
      detection of different HCV strains beyond SVR12. HIV-negative, low-risk
      individuals with SVR12 served as reference patients. Crude reinfection rates and 
      secular trends were assessed. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed 
      to identify baseline factors associated with HCV reinfection. Results: A total of
      216 HIV-positive and 1589 reference patients were recruited, with median
      follow-up durations of 3.0 and 6.0 years, respectively. During a total of 772
      person-years of follow-up (PYFU), the HCV reinfection rate in HIV-positive
      patients was 4.02 per 100 PYFU (95% CI, 2.85-5.65), while the HCV reinfection
      rate in reference patients was 0.14 per 100 PYFU (95% CI, 0.09-0.23) during 10
      862 PYFU. HIV-positive patients had a higher risk of HCV reinfection than
      reference patients (hazard ratio [HR], 17.63; 95% CI, 7.10-43.80; P < .001). No
      baseline factors were predictive of HCV reinfection in HIV-positive patients. The
      incidence of HCV reinfection in HIV-positive patients increased after 2015, when 
      DAAs were made available in Taiwan. Conclusions: The risk of HCV reinfection
      remains high in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with treatment-induced SVR12. In
      addition to mass screening and treatment scale-up, strategies to reduce
      reinfection are needed for HCV microelimination in HIV-positive patients in
      Taiwan.

TI  - Cardiovascular Response of Aged Outpatients With Systemic Diseases During Tooth
      Extraction: A Single-Center Retrospective Observational Study.
PG  - 938609
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.938609 [doi]
AB  - Background: Aged people are maintaining many natural teeth due to improved oral
      health. However, compromised general health and poor oral hygiene habits at
      earlier ages resulted in poor status of preserved teeth. Therefore, tooth
      extraction is required in many aged people. More knowledge is needed because
      there are many risk factors during the surgery in frail aged adults. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the cardiovascular response of such a population
      during tooth extraction and analyze risk factors to provide clinical guidance.
      Methods: A retrospective study was performed on aged patients with systemic
      diseases who underwent tooth extraction. Data regarding demographic profiles and 
      cardiovascular parameters of heart rate and blood pressure were collected
      preoperative, when local anesthesia was administered, at the beginning of tooth
      extraction, 5 min after tooth extraction, and postoperative. The effects of risk 
      factors, including age, sex, and systemic diseases on these parameters were
      analyzed with a multilevel model. Results: Heart rate (HR), systolic blood
      pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of aged patients increased
      significantly when performing local anesthesia and tooth extraction. During the
      operation, the older patients (beta = 2.011, P = 0.005) and the diabetics (beta =
      3.902, P < 0.0001) were associated with higher SBP, while those with more tooth
      extractions exhibited higher HR (beta = 0.893, P = 0.007). Women patients showed 
      both significantly elevated HR (beta = 1.687, P < 0.0001) and SBP (beta = 2.268, 
      P < 0.0001). However, for coronary artery disease patients, HR (beta = -2.747, P 
      < 0.0001) and blood pressure [SBP (beta = -4.094, P < 0.0001) and DBP (beta =
      -0.87, P = 0.016)] were markedly lower than those of patients without a diagnosis
      of coronary artery disease. Conclusion: Cardiovascular response of aged
      outpatients with systemic diseases during tooth extraction is quite significant. 
      Age, sex, systemic diseases, and the number of tooth extraction could be risk
      factors closely associated with cardiovascular response. The findings might
      provide safety guidance for dentists on tooth extraction in this population.

TI  - Prevalence of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Status Among Healthcare Workers and 
      Its Impact on Their Mental Health During the Crisis of COVID-19: A
      Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 904550
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.904550 [doi]
AB  - Objective: After the unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, 
      the health status of the general population has suffered a huge threat, and the
      mental health of front-line healthcare providers has also encountered great
      challenges. Therefore, this study aims to: (1) investigate the prevalence and
      influencing factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among healthcare
      providers, and (2) verify the moderating role of self-efficacy in the influence
      of PTSD on mental health. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an
      online survey of 1993 participants. The presence of depression, anxiety,
      self-efficacy, and PTSD was evaluated using screening tests from March 1.
      Sociodemographic and COVID-19-related data were also collected. A data analysis
      was performed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient,
      and multiple linear regression. Results: The prevalence of PTSD among healthcare 
      providers was 9.3%. PTSD was negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r =
      -0.265, P < 0.01), anxiety (r = -0.453, P < 0.01), and depression (r = 0.708, P <
      0.01). Profession, daily working hours, maximum continuous working days, and
      daily sleep time were influencing factors of PTSD. A binary logistic regression
      analysis showed that physicians (OR = 2.254, 95% CI = 1.298, 3.914) and nurses
      (OR = 2.176, 95% CI = 1.337, 3.541) were more likely to experience PTSD than
      other healthcare providers. Conclusion: Self-efficacy has a moderating effect on 
      the influence of PTSD on anxiety and depression. This suggests that health
      managers need to respond to the current psychological crisis of healthcare
      providers, implement appropriate psychological interventions, and minimize the
      psychological harm caused by COVID-19.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine uptake and associated factors among pregnant women attending
      antenatal care in Debre Tabor public health institutions: A cross-sectional
      study.
PG  - 919494
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.919494 [doi]
AB  - Background: Vaccination is the best means of reducing the increased risk of
      severe COVID-19 during pregnancy. Data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake among pregnant 
      women in Ethiopia is scarce. Thus, this study aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccine
      uptake and associated factors among pregnant women. Method: An institution-based 
      cross-sectional study was conducted among 634 pregnant women attending antenatal 
      care in Debre Tabor public health institutions from March 14 to 30, 2022.
      Participants were recruited using a multistage sampling technique and data were
      collected via face-to-face interviews using a pre-tested structured
      questionnaire. Stata version 16.0 software was used for data analysis. Multiple
      logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with COVID-19 
      vaccine uptake, with a p-value< 0.05 considered statistically significant.
      Result: Only 14.4% (95% CI: 11.7%-17.3%) of participants had received at least
      one dose of COVID-19 vaccines. The main reasons for declining vaccination were
      fear that the COVID-19 vaccine may have harmful side effects on the fetus or the 
      mother. Being 45 or older (AOR: 1.75, 95%CI: 1.01-2.95), being married (AOR:
      1.26, 95%CI: 1.12, 2.96), having good knowledge (AOR:3.52, 95%CI:1.83-3.87), and 
      a positive attitude (AOR:4.81, 95% CI: 1.42-7.33) were positive predictors of
      COVID-19 vaccine uptake. But attaining a college or university education (AOR:
      0.43, 95%CI: 0.12-0.69) was found to be a barrier to vaccine uptake by pregnant
      women. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women was substantially
      low. Old age, being married, low education, good knowledge, and a positive
      attitude were significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. To enhance the
      COVID-19 vaccine uptake, the government should improve the knowledge and attitude
      of pregnant women toward the COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - Background: The readiness to pay for health insurance has an impact on universal 
      health care. This study investigated the willingness of public civil servants in 
      Dessie City Administration, North-East Ethiopia, to pay for social health
      insurance and associated factors. Methods: From April to May 2021, a
      cross-sectional study was undertaken. The sectors from which the samples were
      proportionately allocated were chosen using a multistage sampling procedure.
      Using their payroll list as a sampling frame, simple random sampling was done to 
      recruit them. A semi-structured self-administered questionnaire was used to
      collect data. Epi Data version 3.1 was used to enter, code, and clean the data,
      which was then exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. To determine
      relationships, bi-variable and multivariable analyses were utilized. Candidates
      for multivariable analysis were variables with a p-value </= 0.3 in bi-variable
      analysis. AOR with a 95% CI was used to determine the strength and direction of
      association. Statistical significance was defined at p-value < 0.05. Results: A
      total of 796 employees took part in the study, with a 94.42% response rate.
      Overall, 29.60% of them were willing to pay for the scheme (95% CI: 26.4, 33%).
      The decision to pay was influenced by favorable perception (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI:
      1.72, 3.44), household income < Birr 5,000 (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.48),
      acute illness (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.72), bachelor level education (AOR =
      0.44, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.70), master and above level education (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI: 
      0.14, 0.49), and age 25-29 years (AOR = 1.97, 95 % CI: 1.08, 3.57). Conclusion:
      The willingness of the civil servants to pay for social health insurance was low,
      and it was influenced by their attitudes toward the scheme, the occurrence of
      severe illness, income level, educational status, and age.

TI  - Selecting Euploid Embryos for Transfer by Preimplantation Genetic Testing with
      the Help of Next-Generation Sequencing in Poor Prognosis Patients: A
      Retrospective Cohort Analysis.
PG  - 157-162
LID - 10.4103/jhrs.jhrs_166_21 [doi]
AB  - Background: The current embryo selection methods rely on subjective grading of
      embryo morphology or a real-time monitoring of the embryonic development and
      assessment of multiple quantitative endpoints. Even up to 40% of morphologically 
      normal embryos harbour aneuploidies. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is a
      technology, which gives opportunity to identify euploid embryos before
      implantation. Aims: This study seeks to determine the role of PGT in poor
      prognosis patients, i.e., patients with advanced maternal age (AMA) (maternal age
      >/=35 years), recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) (miscarriages >/=2) and recurrent
      implantation failures (RIFs) (in vitro fertilisation failures >/=3). Study
      Setting and Design: A retrospective case-control study was done on a group of
      patients who underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection for the indications of
      AMA, RPL and RIF. Materials and Methods: In 33 cases who opted for PGT, day 5
      blastocysts were subjected to trophectoderm biopsy with the help of
      next-generation sequencing. Euploid blastocyst was transferred in hormone
      replacement cycle at a later date. In 154 controls, blastocyst transfer was done 
      based on morphological grading. Pregnancy outcomes are compared in terms of
      implantation rate, pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate. 
      Statistical Analysis: Chi-square test was used for comparisons between the study 
      groups with respect to percentage. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
      significant. Results: The highest aneuploidy rate was found in embryos with AMA. 
      Implantation rate was found to be statistically significantly higher in the PGT
      group as compared to the non-PGT group. However, take-home baby rates were not
      improved by PGT. There were less number of mean embryos transferred in the PGT
      group and lower multiple pregnancy rate. Conclusions: With the application of
      PGT, embryo selection rates and implantation rates improved in poor prognosis
      patients.

      Reproductive Techniques.
PG  - 150-156
LID - 10.4103/jhrs.jhrs_57_22 [doi]
AB  - Background: The emergence of the COVID pandemic unfolded a series of precautions 
      and dilemmas and the complete suspension of health services. With the gradual
      emergence of data showing near minimal effects of the virus on pregnancy,
      Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) services were gradually resumed following 
      guidelines and advisories. Aim: The purpose of this study was to detect the COVID
      positivity rate in women undergoing ART treatment during the COVID pandemic and
      compare clinical and embryological outcomes to the ART cycles performed in the
      pre-COVID era. Study Setting and Design: This was a retrospective cohort study of
      all women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by a fresh or
      frozen embryo transfer (ET) between 1st October 2019 and 31st March 2020 (control
      group) and between 1st April 2020 and 31st September 2020 (study group) at Nova
      IVF Fertility Clinic, Ahmedabad. Material and Methods: The study group underwent 
      ART during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India and when gradual
      unlocking of facilities including ART was advised as per the national ART
      advisory by the ICMR in December 2020. The outcomes were compared with the
      control group (cycles in pre-covid time). Statistical Analysis: Statistical
      analysis was performed in SPSS (v25.0) and included Mann-Whitney U, Fisher's
      exact and Pearson Chi-square as appropriate. Values of P < 0.05 were considered
      statistically significant. Results: A total of 367 in vitro fertilisation (IVF)
      stimulations were initiated. A total of 342 retrievals and 606 ETs (171 fresh and
      435 frozen) were completed during the study period with a COVID positivity rate
      of 6.8% (25/367) amongst fresh and 3.9% (18/453) amongst frozen ETs,
      respectively; the PR and IR in the study group was similar to the control group
      (47.6 vs. 55.1 P = 0.4 and 68.7 vs. 66.4; P = 0.52, respectively). The maternal
      complication rates were similar in both groups with a COVID positivity rate of
      10.2% (23/225) and 1 maternal death in the study group. The live birth rates were
      similar. Conclusions: We did not find a noteworthy difference in the clinical and
      embryological outcomes in the IVF cycles conducted in the COVID era as compared
      to the pre-COVID time. Thus, with adequate precautions and safety measures, ART
      services conducted during the COVID pandemic have comparable birth outcomes and
      can be safely advocated.

AB  - Background: Alternative and complementary therapies have been gaining popularity 
      as ways to reduce anxiety in patients. Aim: This study aimed to assess whether
      yoga and meditation could decrease the severity of anxiety in Indian women
      diagnosed with infertility Study. Study Setting and Design: This was a
      retrospective data analysis of anxiety score of 354 women undergoing treatment at
      a tertiary infertility hospital between January 2016 and December 2018. Materials
      and Method: Women participated in group yoga, meditation and counselling therapy 
      intervention during their treatment period. A self-reported questionnaire that
      used the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 criteria measured the participants'
      severity of anxiety at the start of and again at the end of the intervention.
      Statistical Analysis: Demographic analysis and a two-tailed paired t-test were
      applied between groups. Results: The results indicated that there was a
      statistically significant mean reduction (7.3 +/- 2.7) in the anxiety scores of
      the participants between entry (12.94 +/- 2.65) and following exposure (5.39 +/- 
      1.99) to the intervention (P < 0.0001). The mean reduction in scores remained
      similar between participants who received </=6 sessions (7.50 +/- 2.68) and
      participants who received >6 sessions (7.10 +/- 2.64) (P > 0.05). Among the
      participants that experienced mild anxiety at baseline (n = 43), 72.1% (n = 31)
      reported experiencing minimal anxiety following the intervention (P < 0.0001).
      Among those that experienced moderate anxiety at baseline (n = 213), 32.4% (n =
      69) reported experiencing minimal anxiety post-intervention (P < 0.0001).
      Participants who expressed severe anxiety at baseline (n = 94, 26.6%), reported
      experiencing minimal anxiety (13.8% [n = 13)], mild anxiety (81.9% [n = 77]) and 
      moderate anxiety (4.3% [n = 4]) after exposure to the intervention (P < 0.0001). 
      None of the participants reported experiencing severe anxiety post-intervention. 
      Conclusion: The benefits of alternative anxiety-reduction therapies for women
      diagnosed with infertility have been demonstrated in this study. These therapies 
      can be used to complement the routine treatment of such patients.

AB  - Background: Thyroid dysfunction impairs female fertility and pregnancy outcome.
      Optimal preconception and gestational TSH level is still debatable in
      IVF-conceived pregnancies. Aims: To explore the relationships of IVF success and 
      pregnancy outcomes with maternal serum levels of TSH (at both preconception and
      12-week IVF-conceived pregnancy). Also, to confirm or refute the recommended TSH 
      level </=2.5muIU/mL. Study Setting and Design: Retrospective cohort. Material and
      Methods: 158 IVF-conceived pregnant women and 117 age-matched controls
      non-pregnant (</=39years, BMI 18.5-38kg/m2) were recruited. Preconception and
      12-week IVF-conceived pregnancy serum samples were analysed for reproductive
      hormones, fasting glucose, insulin and TSH levels. Data of pregnant women at 28
      weeks for GDM screening (75-gram OGTT) and up until delivery were included.
      Statistical Analysis: Binary logistic regression used to predict association
      between preconception TSH levels and IVF success, and pregnancy outcomes.
      Association of delta change of hormones was determined with linear regression.
      Significance level P</=0.05 with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Overall, 
      median (IQR) age was 32(6)years, BMI 25.4(6.9)kg/m2, HbA1c 5.2(0.52)% and TSH
      1.82(1.4)muIU/mL. There was no significant association between preconception TSH 
      level and IVF success rate. During the first trimester of IVF-conceived
      pregnancy, delta change in TSH level was associated with that of progesterone
      (P=0.03). 12-week gestation TSH level did not predict adverse pregnancy outcomes 
      (i.e. onset of GDM, delivery type and premature delivery); but a higher TSH level
      predicted earlier delivery in weeks. There was a higher risk of delivery by
      caesarean section when TSH>2.5muIU/mL. Conclusion: Variation of maternal TSH
      within normal range (0.4-4.0muIU/mL) at preconception and 12-week gestation has
      no predictive effect on IVF success and pregnancy outcomes in IVF-pregnancy. Our 
      data provide no support for a recommended preconception TSH level </=2.5muIU/mL
      in IVF-conceived pregnancy, but rather promote a preconception TSH level within
      normal range.

TI  - Retrospective Analysis of the First Collection versus the Second Collection in
      Severe Oligo-asthenoteratozoospermia Cases in Self-Intracytoplasmic Sperm
      Injection Patients.
PG  - 138-142
LID - 10.4103/jhrs.jhrs_46_22 [doi]
AB  - Background: It is well established that high-quality semen can lead to an
      improved fertilisation rate. Ejaculatory abstinence (EA) certainly can influence 
      sperm quality such as volume, count, motility and morphology. However, very few
      studies have addressed the influence of EA on intracytoplasmic sperm injection
      (ICSI) outcome and especially in males with severe oligo-asthenoteratozoospermia 
      (OAT) syndrome. Aim: This study was undertaken with the purpose of evaluating the
      advantage of shorter abstinence period (1-h sequential ejaculation) in males with
      severe OAT syndrome on total usable embryo rate and thereby emphasising the
      potential application of consecutive ejaculate. Study Setting and Design: This
      retrospective cohort study consisted of all the infertile couples undergoing ICSI
      cycle with the indicated seminal characteristics who had consulted the tertiary
      care hospital between January 2021 and July 2021. Materials & Methods: All
      couples in the study had idiopathic male infertility. Retrospectively, two groups
      were analysed, i.e., Group A with 56 subjects in which first semen sample was
      used for ICSI cycle and another Group B with 41 subjects in which second semen
      sample collected within a shorter abstinence period of 1 h was used. Statistical 
      Analysis: The data were descriptively analysed using GraphPad Prism (vs. 9.2).
      Unpaired t-test and analysis of variance test were used to determine the
      significance. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The age
      of female subjects in Group A was 29.9 +/- 3.5 years while it was 29.4 +/- 3.4
      years in Group B. Similarly, the age of male subjects was 32.2 +/- 3.6 years and 
      31.9 +/- 4.1 years in Group A and Group B, respectively, with no statistical
      differences in any gender between the groups (P > 0.05). Apart from initial
      progressive motility (P = 0.004), none of the parameters such as total volume,
      total sperm count and morphology were significantly different (P > 0.05) between 
      Group A and samples of Group B. Similarly, parameters such as volume (P = 0.006) 
      and post-wash motility (P < 0.001) were significantly different between Group A
      and samples of Group B. However, there was no significant difference in sperm
      count and morphology (P > 0.05). Grade 1 embryos on day 3 were 345 (62.8%) in
      Group A and 170 (54.3%) in Group B. Overall, the total usable embryos in Group A 
      and Group B were 222 (40.4%) and 148 (47.3%), respectively (P > 0.05).
      Conclusion: With regard to compromised sperm parameters, our findings do suggest 
      that the second ejaculate is quite relevant to 'in vitro' reproductive treatments
      and a simple request for a second consecutive ejaculate (shorter abstinence
      period of 1 h) could provide the same results in terms of fertilisation. We
      observed the increased chances of usable embryos in the second ejaculate group.

      Clinical Pregnancies in Donor Egg Recipients?
PG  - 143-149
LID - 10.4103/jhrs.jhrs_15_22 [doi]
AB  - Background: Microfluidics (MF), an advanced sperm sorting technology results in
      the extraction of spermatozoa with higher DNA integrity and lower DNA damage
      compared to existing conventional sperm sorting methods. Aims: The aim of the
      present study is to assess the efficiency of MF and to isolate the best
      spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) over the density gradient
      (DG) technique. Study Setting and Design: We recruited couples who choose the
      oocyte donation programme for this study to eliminate confounding factors
      associated with oocyte quality. Materials and Methods: Sperm was processed by MF 
      (n = 180) and DG (n = 151). ICSI was performed and positive pregnancy,
      miscarriage and clinical pregnancy rates were compared. Statistical Analysis: All
      variables were analysed using Graph Pad Prism 5. The unpaired two-tailed t-test
      was used to assess the significance. A value of P < 0.05 was considered
      statistically significant. Results: There was no significant difference in
      pregnancy rates between the groups. However, a clear demarcation is seen in terms
      of clinical pregnancy rates, where the DG group achieved higher clinical
      pregnancies (91.7%) compared to the MF group (80.7%). Further, we compared
      miscarriage rates and biochemical pregnancies, and found a significantly higher
      miscarriage and biochemical pregnancy rate in the MF group (14.5% and 4%,
      respectively) compared to the DG group (6% and 1%, respectively). Conclusions:
      Based on the available literature, we anticipated a higher clinical pregnancy
      rate with MF compared with conventional processing. Our results show MF does not 
      have any add-on positive effect on clinical pregnancy rate.

TI  - Association Between Polymorphisms in Estrogen Receptor Genes and Depression in
      Women: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 936296
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.936296 [doi]
AB  - Objective: It is suggested that estrogen receptors (ERs) might be associated with
      the disproportionate vulnerability of women to depressive episodes. Several
      variants in ER-alpha (ERalpha) and ER-beta (ERbeta) have been linked to
      depression, but the results were not consistent. Hence, we conducted a
      meta-analysis to evaluate the association between ERalpha/ERbeta and depression
      in a cohort of women. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in
      public databases. The genetic association between polymorphisms in Eralpha/ERbeta
      and depression risk in a cohort of women was evaluated by odds ratios (ORs) and
      95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cochran's Q test and the I(2) index were used to 
      evaluate heterogeneity. Results: In total, 10 studies and 4 SNPs (rs2234693,
      rs9340799, rs4986938, rs1256049) were included in our meta-analysis. rs2234693
      genotype was significantly associated with the risk of depression in women by
      dominant model (CC + CT vs TT, OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.09-1.55, p = 0.0031),
      recessive model (CC vs CT + TT, OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.00-2.67, p = 0.0478),
      additive model (CC vs TT, OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.12-3.35, p = 0.0189) and allelic
      model (C vs T, OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10-1.39, p = 0.0003). For rs9340799, the
      frequencies of risk genotypes according to the dominant (GG + GA vs AA, OR =
      1.47, 95% CI = 1.10-1.98, p = 0.0096, I(2) = 0%, p = 0.43) and allelic (G vs A,
      OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04-1.69, p = 0.0236, I(2) = 0%, p = 0.39) models were
      significantly lower in women with depression than in controls within the Asian
      subgroup. For rs1256049, risk genotypes were significantly more frequent in
      depressed subjects than in controls under the dominant model (AA+ GA vs GG, OR = 
      1.62, 95% CI: 1.19-2.21, p = 0.0024) and the allelic model (A vs G, OR = 1.35,
      95% CI: 1.07-1.72, p = 0.012) after sensitivity analysis by omitting one study
      which induce the heterogeneity. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis is the
      first and most comprehensive investigation of the association between ERs and
      depression in women, and the findings support the concept that ERs participate in
      the etiology of sex heterogeneity in depression.

      Pathway-Related Prognostic Prediction Model in Gastric Cancer.
PG  - 891744
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.891744 [doi]
AB  - Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the malignant tumors worldwide. Janus
      (JAK)-signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway
      is involved in cellular biological process and immune function. However, the
      association between them is still not systematically described. Therefore, in
      this study, we aimed to identify key genes involved in JAK-STAT signaling pathway
      and GC, as well as the potential mechanism. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas
      (TCGA) database was the source of RNA-sequencing data of GC patients. Gene
      Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used as the validation set. The predictive 
      value of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway-related prognostic prediction model was
      examined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO); survival,
      univariate, and multivariate Cox regression analyses; and receiver operating
      characteristic curve (ROC) analyses to examine the predictive value of the model.
      Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and chi-square test
      were used to verify the expression of genes in the model and assess the
      association between the genes and clinicopathological parameters of GC patients, 
      respectively. Then, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
      (KEGG), gene set enrichment analysis, version 3.0 (GSEA), sequence-based RNA
      adenosine methylation site predictor (SRAMP) online websites, and RNA
      immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments were used to predict the model-related
      potential pathways, m6A modifications, and the association between model genes
      and m6A. Results: A four-gene prognostic model (GHR, PIM1, IFNA8, and IFNB1) was 
      constructed, namely, riskScore. The Kaplan-Meier curves suggested that patients
      with high riskScore expression had a poorer prognosis than those with low
      riskScore expression (p = 0.006). Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed
      that the model could be an independent predictor (p < 0.001; HR = 3.342, 95%, CI 
      = 1.834-6.088). The 5-year area under time-dependent ROC curve (AUC) reached
      0.655. The training test set verified these results. Further analyses unveiled an
      enrichment of cancer-related pathways, m6A modifications, and the direct
      interaction between m6A and the four genes. Conclusion: This four-gene prognostic
      model could be applied to predict the prognosis of GC patients and might be a
      promising therapeutic target in GC.

PG  - 888051
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.888051 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to identify the hub gene in gastric cancer (GC)
      tumorigenesis. A biomarker prediction model was constructed and analyzed, and
      protein expression in histopathological samples was verified in a validation
      cohort. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from GC
      projects in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Functional enrichment
      analysis of DEGs was performed between the high- and low- Ribonuclease P protein 
      subunit p30 (RPP30) expression groups. ROC analysis was performed to assess RPP30
      expression to discriminate GC from normal tissues. Functional enrichment pathways
      and immune infiltration of DEGs were analyzed using GSEA and ssGSEA. Survival
      analysis and nomogram construction were performed to predict patient survival.
      Immunohistochemical staining of GC tissues was performed to validate RPP30
      expression in GC and paracancerous samples. Results: Gene expression data and
      clinical information of 380 cases (375 GC samples and 32 para-cancerous tissues) 
      were collected from TCGA database. The AUC for RPP30 expression was found to be
      0.785. The G alpha S signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched
      signaling pathway. Primary therapy outcome (p < 0.001, HR = 0.243, 95% CI =
      0.156-0.379), age (p = 0.012, HR = 1.748, 95% CI = 1.133-2.698), and RPP30
      expression (p < 0.001, HR = 2.069, 95% CI = 1.346-3.181) were identified as
      independent prognostic factors. As a quantitative approach, a nomogram
      constructed based on RPP30 expression, age, and primary therapy outcome performed
      well in predicting patient survival. Nineteen of the 25 tissue samples from the
      validation cohort showed positive RPP30 expression in GC tissues, whereas 16
      cases showed negative RPP30 staining in normal tissues. The difference between
      the two was statistically significant. Conclusion: High RPP30 expression was
      significantly correlated with disease progression and poor survival in GC,
      promoting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis via tRNA dysregulation. This study
      provides new and promising insights into the molecular pathogenesis of tRNA in
      GC.

TI  - A novel mutation in the UBAP1 gene causing hereditary spastic paraplegia: A case 
      report and overview of the genotype-phenotype correlation.
PG  - 936292
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.936292 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is considered to be one of the common
      neurodegenerative diseases with marked genetic heterogeneity. Recently, the
      mutations in ubiquitin-associated protein 1 (UBAP1) have been described in
      patients with HSP, known as spastic paraplegias 80 (SPG80). Here, we reported a
      Chinese HSP family presenting a frameshift mutation in the UBAP1 gene leading to 
      complex HSP. Their clinical features encompassed spastic paraparetic gait,
      exaggerated patellar tendon reflexes, bilateral Babinski signs, and hyperactive
      Achilles tendon reflex. The proband also had severe urinary incontinence and a
      dermoid cyst at the lumbar 4-5 spinal cord, which rarely occurs in HSP patients. 
      Following whole-exome sequencing, a novel heterozygous mutation (c.437dupG,
      NM_016,525) was identified in the UBAP1 that segregated with the family's
      phenotype and resulted in truncating UBAP1 protein (p.Ser146ArgfsTer13).
      Moreover, we reviewed the genotypes of UBAP1 and the phenotypic variability in 90
      HSP patients reported in the literature. We found that the age of onset in
      UBAP1-related patients was juvenile, and there were population differences in the
      age of onset. The main complications were lower extremity spasticity,
      hyperreflexia, and the Babinski sign. Exon 4 of UBAP1 was identified as a
      mutation hotspot region. Our study expands the knowledge of UBAP1 mutations,
      which will aid in HSP patient counseling. Further molecular biological research
      is needed to explore the genotype-phenotype correlations of UBAP1-related HSP.

AB  - Cactus pear fruit and Moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam) are nutritionally abundant
      food sources. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of cactus pear
      fruit for jelly development with the supplementation of M. oleifera leaves
      extract as means of postharvest loss, food insecurity and malnutrition reduction.
      D-optimal mixture design in Minitab Version 16 Statistical Software was used to
      generate ten experimental runs (formulations for jelly development) using 60-80% 
      cactus fruit juice (CFJ), 0-20% M. oleifera extract (MOE), and 20-40% table sugar
      (TS). The developed jellies were analyzed for proximate composition, mineral
      content (Fe, Ca and Zn) and sensory evaluation. Nutritional and sensorial
      optimization was carried through a graphical approach using a D-optimal mixture
      design. The results indicated a significant difference in protein, fat, fibre,
      ash, carbohydrate, energy, iron, calcium, zinc, appearance, aroma, and taste
      amongst the formulated jellies (p < 0.05). In contrast, the significant
      difference was not observed in mouth feel and overall acceptability amongst the
      jellies. The overall optimum nutritional and sensorial attributes of the jelly
      were found in a range of CFJ (70-73%), MOE (3-14%) and TS (20-26%). However,
      developing jelly with the formulation of CFJ (68 %), MOE (12%) and TS (20%) was
      predicted to give the highest nutritional value and sensory acceptability score. 
      The optimized result indicated the jelly would contain 3.97% protein, 0.92% fat, 
      1.09% fiber, 1.19% ash, 62.95% carbohydrate, 275.97 kcal/100 g energy, 98.45
      mg/100 g calcium, 0.25 mg/100 g zinc, 7.43 mg/100 g iron and overall sensory
      acceptability score of 4.38 in five-point hedonic scale.

AB  - This study was aimed to investigate the effect of emotional intelligence and some
      personality traits on safe behavior and needle stick injuries among the nurses.
      This cross-sectional study was performed on 200 nursing staff of a hospital in
      Iran. To collect data, individuals were asked to complete several questionnaires,
      including demographic questionnaire, domain-specific risk-taking questionnaire,
      Rosenberg self-confidence questionnaire, Buss-Perry aggression questionnaire,
      Goleman emotional intelligence questionnaire, and safe behavior questionnaire.
      Also, the number of needlestick injuries in the participants was extracted from
      their medical records. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software (version 22),
      and path analysis was performed using AMOS software. The prevalence of needle
      stick injuries in the subjects was estimated by 45.5 percent. The results showed 
      that increasing risk-taking, increasing aggression, decreasing self-confidence,
      and decreasing emotional intelligence reduced safe behavior and increased the
      number of needle injuries (P < 0.001). In the present study, some personal traits
      affecting the occurrence of needlestick injuries were identified. It is
      recommended that people without these negative traits are applied in dangerous
      occupations with a high probability of needle stick injuries.

      ripening.
PG  - uhac118
LID - 10.1093/hr/uhac118 [doi]
AB  - Several vineyard techniques have been proposed to delay grape maturity in light
      of the advanced maturation driven by increasingly frequent water and heat stress 
      events that are detrimental to grape quality. These studies differ in terms of
      their experimental conditions, and in the present work we have attempted to
      summarize previous observations in a quantitative, data-driven systematic review.
      A meta-analysis of quantitative data gathered across 43 relevant studies revealed
      the overall significance of the proposed treatments and evaluated the impact of
      different experimental conditions on the outcome of antitranspirants, delayed
      pruning and late source limitation. Antitranspirants were most effective when
      applied twice and closer to veraison, while di-1-p-menthene increased the
      ripening delay by about 1 degrees Brix compared to kaolin. Larger ripening delays
      were achieved with delayed pruning of low-yielding vines or by pruning at later
      stages of apical bud development. Late defoliation or shoot trimming delayed
      ripening in high-yielding vines and represent suitable solutions for
      late-harvested varieties, but became ineffective where the treatment decreased
      yield. This quantitative meta-analysis of 242 primary observations uncovers
      factors affecting the efficacy of vineyard practices to delay ripening, which
      should be carefully considered by grape growers attempting to achieve this
      outcome.

TI  - Seasonality Affects Elderly Hip Fracture Mortality Risk During the COVID-19
      Pandemic.
PG  - e26530
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26530 [doi]
AB  - Background The incidence of geriatric hip fractures, respiratory infections
      (e.g., coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), influenza), and mortality is higher
      during the fall and winter. The purpose of this study is to assess whether the
      addition of seasonality to a validated geriatric inpatient mortality risk tool
      will improve the predictive capacity and risk stratification for geriatric hip
      fracture patients. We hypothesize that seasonality will improve the predictive
      capacity. Methodology Between October 2014 and August 2021, 2,421 patients
      >55-year-old treated for hip fracture were analyzed for demographics, date of
      presentation, COVID-19 status (for patients after February 2020), and mortality. 
      Patients were grouped by season based on their admission dates into the following
      four cohorts: fall (September-November), winter (December-February), spring
      (March-May), and summer (June-August). Patients presenting during the fall/winter
      and spring/summer were compared. The baseline Score for Trauma Triage in the
      Geriatric and Middle-Aged (STTGMA) tool for hip fractures (STTGMAHIP_FX_SCORE)
      and the seasonality iteration (STTGMA_SEASON) were also compared. Sub-analysis
      was conducted on 687 patients between February 2020 and August 2021 amid the
      COVID-19 pandemic. The baseline score (STTGMAHIP_FX_SCORE) and the COVID-19
      iteration (STTGMACOVID_ORIGINAL_2020) were modified to include seasonality
      (STTGMA_COVID/SEASON). Patients were stratified by risk score and compared. The
      predictive ability of the models was compared using DeLong's test. Results For
      the overall cohort, patients who presented during the fall/winter had a higher
      rate of inpatient mortality (2.87% vs. 1.25%, p < 0.01). STTGMA_SEASON improved
      the predictive capacity for inpatient mortality compared to STTGMAHIP_FX_SCORE
      but not significantly (0.773 vs. 0.672, p = 0.105) On sub-analysis, regression
      weighting showed a coefficient of 0.643, with fall and winter having a greater
      absolute effect size (fall = 2.572, winter = 1.929, spring = 1.286, summer =
      0.643). STTGMA_COVID/SEASON improved the predictive capacity for inpatient
      mortality compared to STTGMAHIP_FX_SCORE (0.882 vs. 0.581, p < 0.01) and
      STTGMACOVID_ORIGINAL_2020 (0.882 vs. 0.805, p = 0.04). The highest risk quartile 
      contained 89.5% of patients who expired during their index inpatient
      hospitalization (p < 0.01) and 68.2% of patients who died within 30 days of
      discharge (p < 0.01). Conclusions Seasonality may play a role in both the
      incidence and impact of COVID-19 and additional respiratory infections. Including
      seasonality improves the predictive capacity and risk stratification of the
      STTGMA tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. This allows for effective triage and
      closer surveillance of high-risk geriatric hip fracture patients by better
      accounting for the increased respiratory infection incidence and the associated
      mortality risk seen during fall and winter.

TI  - Goiter in a 6-year-old patient with novel thyroglobulin gene variant (Gly145Glu) 
      causing intracellular thyroglobulin transport disorder: Correlation between
      goiter size and the free T3 to free T4 ratio.

AB  - Thyroglobulin gene abnormalities cause thyroid dyshormonogenesis. A 6-yr-old boy 
      of consanguineous parents presented with a large goiter and mild hypothyroidism
      (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] 7.2 muIU/mL, free T3 [FT3] 3.4 pg/mL, free T4 
      [FT4] 0.6 ng/dL). Despite levothyroxine (LT4) administration and normal TSH
      levels, the goiter progressed slowly and increased rapidly in size at the onset
      of puberty. Thyroid scintigraphy revealed a remarkably high (123)I uptake of
      75.2%, with a serum thyroglobulin level of 13 ng/ml, which was disproportionately
      low for the goiter size. DNA sequencing revealed a novel homozygous missense
      variant, c.434G>A [p.Gly145Glu], in the thyroglobulin gene. Goiter growth was
      suppressed by increasing the LT4 dose. Thyroidectomy was performed at
      17-yr-of-age. Thyroglobulin analysis of the thyroid tissue detected mutant
      thyroglobulin present in the endoplasmic reticulum, demonstrating that
      thyroglobulin transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus was
      impaired by the Gly145Glu variant. During the clinical course, an elevated
      FT3/FT4 ratio was observed along with thyroid enlargement. A high FT3/FT4 ratio
      and goiter seemed to be compensatory responses to impaired hormone synthesis.
      Thyroglobulin defects with goiter should be treated with LT4, even if TSH levels 
      are normal.

AB  - A 3-mo-old male infant was referred to our hospital with micropenis. Since his
      serum LH, FSH, and testosterone levels were low (< 0.3 mIU/mL, 0.08 mIU/mL, and <
      0.03 ng/mL, respectively), Kallmann syndrome/normosmic hypogonadotropic
      hypogonadism was suspected. In the process of searching for complications of
      Kallmann syndrome/normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, a right adrenal gland 
      tumor was incidentally discovered. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1
      neuroblastoma. A homozygous p.P147L (c.C440T) mutation in the KISS1R gene was
      detected as a cause of the congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. KISS1-KISS1R
      signaling, which is essential for GnRH secretion, exhibits anti-metastatic and/or
      anti-tumoral roles in numerous cancers. High KISS1 expression levels reportedly
      predict better survival outcomes than low KISS1 expression levels in
      neuroblastoma. Therefore, decreased KISS1-KISS1R signaling may have played a role
      in the neuroblastoma in this patient.

AB  - Recent studies have indicated that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in
      fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) are involved in the development of
      congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and combined pituitary hormone
      deficiency (CPHD). We encountered a Japanese boy with short stature and pubertal 
      failure. Endocrine studies showed GH, TSH, and LH/FSH deficiencies, and brain
      magnetic resonance imaging delineated hypoplastic anterior pituitary and ectopic 
      posterior pituitary. The patient was treated with GH, l-thyroxine, and hCG/rFSH. 
      Next-generation sequencing panel for pituitary dysfunction identified a probably 
      weak disease-associated heterozygous missense variant in FGFR1
      (NM_023110.3:c.176A>T:p.(Asp59Val)), together with a probably non-deleterious
      heterozygous missense variant in KISS1R (NM_032551.5:c.769G>C:p.(Val257Leu)). We 
      also review six previously reported CHPD patients with probably deleterious FGFR1
      variants. The data, in conjunction with the previously reported cases, argue for 
      the relevance of FGFR1 variants to the development of CPHD.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic, and inflammatory joint disease 
      with oral complications. This research aimed to compare the oral health-related
      quality of life and decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) index in rheumatoid 
      arthritis patients over 18 years with healthy individuals. In this study, 45
      rheumatoid arthritis cases were assigned to the experimental group, and 45
      healthy individuals were assigned to the control group. After completing
      biography forms, the participants filled out two questionnaires. These
      questionnaires included the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) and the Oral 
      Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). Next, their teeth were clinically examined to
      check for caries. Finally, the data were analyzed statistically. RA and control
      groups were similar in gender, marital status, age, occupation, and level of
      education. However, a significant difference was observed between the two groups 
      concerning DMFT (P<0.001) and total OHIP-14 score (P<0.001). Moreover, no
      significant difference was observed between the groups concerning the total GOHAI
      score (P=0.526). The oral health-related quality of life in rheumatoid arthritis 
      patients was lower than that in the general population, with the rate of dental
      caries being higher in these patients.

AB  - The auditory pathway is the main target for high levels of blood sugar. Increased
      glucose in diabetic patients can disrupt the auditory system physiologically and 
      anatomically. The present study aimed to examine the prevalence of hearing loss
      in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 94 patients with type 2 diabetes,
      aged from 40 to 80 years, were selected randomly in the present descriptive
      cross-sectional study for pure tone audiometry (PTA), speech discrimination score
      (SDS), and speech reception threshold (SRT) tests. Accordingly, patients with a
      hearing threshold larger than or equal to 25 dB were considered hearing-impaired 
      according to the PTA test. In addition, the patients' speech discrimination score
      was measured using a list of monosyllabic words with an intensity of 40 dB or
      more than the SDS test. However, in the SRT test, the patients' superficial
      speech comprehension threshold was measured using a list of two-syllable words.
      Most diabetic patients had hearing loss in both right and left ears based on the 
      PTA and SRT tests. However, they did not have hearing loss in both ears according
      to the SDS test. There was no correlation between the PTA, SRT, and SDS tests and
      blood creatinine levels in both ears (p>0.05). Nevertheless, the right ear had a 
      positive correlation with systolic blood pressure only in the PTA test (p<0.05). 
      The difference between the two groups of men and women with type 2 diabetes in
      the hearing level in the right and left ears was not statistically significant.
      Hearing loss is a common deficiency in diabetic patients. In addition, it seems
      that diabetes is an independent risk factor for the hearing loss level.

      adult mice.
PG  - 819-827
LID - 10.25122/jml-2021-0269 [doi]
AB  - One of the most complex clinical challenges facing medical practice is
      sepsis-induced lung dysfunction resulting from polymicrobial sepsis. Although
      many therapeutic approaches have been used in such clinical challenges, there is 
      still further need for a new effective therapeutic approach. The objective of
      this study was to investigate if Montelukast could protect the lungs during
      polymicrobial sepsis by regulating inflammatory markers and the oxidative stress 
      pathways. Twenty-four mature male Swiss-albino mice aged 8-12 weeks, with a
      weight of 20-30 g, were randomized into 4 equal groups (n=6), sham (laparotomy
      without cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)), CLP (laparotomy with CLP), vehicle 1 
      (equivalent volume of DMSO 1 hour prior to CLP), Montelukast (10 mg/kg IP 1 hour 
      prior to CLP). Lung tissue pro-inflammatory mediators IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-17,
      LTB-4 12(S) HETE, and oxidative stress were assessed using ELISA. The levels of
      F2 isoprostane were considerably greater in the sepsis group (p<0.05) as compared
      to the sham group, while Montelukast was significantly lower (p<0.05) in these
      inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress as compared to the sepsis group.
      Histologically, the lung tissue damage was significant (p<0.05) in all mice in
      the sepsis group, while Montelukast significantly reduced lung tissue injury
      (p<0.05). The current findings indicated that Montelukast could attenuate lung
      dysfunction during CLP-induced polymicrobial sepsis in male mice through their
      modulating effects on pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress downstream signalling
      pathways and subsequently decrease lung tissue cytokine concentrations (IL-1beta,
      IL-6, IL-17, LTB-4, and 12(S)HETE).

AB  - This study investigated the alteration of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and 
      interleukin-19 (IL-19) at different clinical disease stages, lymph node
      metastasis, and ductal carcinoma in women with breast cancer. Serum samples were 
      collected from 90 individuals with an age range of 25-61 years. These individuals
      were divided into a control group (healthy people), consisting of 31 individuals,
      and a breast cancer patients (BCP) group, consisting of 59 individuals. The
      pathological data (tumour stage, lymph node metastasis, and ductal carcinoma) was
      obtained from the medical record of patients and confirmed by experienced
      histopathology. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs) technology was used to
      measure the serum concentrations of IL-19 and TNF-alpha. The results showed
      significant differences (P</=0.002) in the mean of BMI, interleukin-19, and
      TNF-alpha in BCP compared to controls, while the age factor did not play an
      important role. The stages of breast cancer caused clear differences in the
      levels of TNF-alpha and IL-19. According to the findings, BCPs had a greater
      level of TNF-alpha in lymph node metastases than healthy persons. The
      concentration of serum IL-19 in BCP with lymph node metastasis was significantly 
      different in non-lymph node metastasis patients and healthy people. Additionally,
      BCP with ductal carcinoma showed significant differences in the mean levels of
      IL-19 and TNF-alpha in comparison with healthy people.

AB  - Inflammatory cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and toll-like receptors (TLRs)
      play an important role in atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to further
      evaluate the role of inflammatory cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and
      toll-like receptors in atherosclerosis. Forty local breed domestic male rabbits
      were divided randomly into 4 groups, 10 rabbits each. Group I was the control
      group, group II received a high cholesterol diet, group III received the drug
      solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and group IV received Atorvastatin (3.5
      mg/kg/day). Blood samples were collected at 0 times, 5 weeks, and at the end of
      10 weeks. TLRs expression on monocyte was measured by flow cytometry, IL-10,
      IL-17, IL-1beta, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), and vascular cell
      adhesion molecule (VCAM) were measured by ELISA. In group II, a high cholesterol 
      diet led to a statistically significant elevation of lipids profile (TC, TG, and 
      LDL) at both 5 weeks and 10 weeks compared to the control. The expression of TLRs
      was also increased compared to the control (13.53+/-2.5 to 25.79+/-6.5). The
      intimal thickness increased from 103.46+/-13.85 to 248.43+/-11.11. IL-17
      increased significantly from 3.4+/-0.4 to 7.7+/-1.00, and IL-1beta increased from
      1.04+/-0.19 to 9.66+/-1.4 (P 0.05) at 10 weeks. ICAM and VCAM increased from
      1.7+/-0.16 to 8.2+/-0.74 and from 0.89+/-0.07 to 5.2+/-0.45, respectively.
      Atorvastatin significantly reduced TLRs at 10 weeks to 21.98+/-3.4 and intimal
      thickness to 191.6+/-15.59. IL-17, IL-1beta, ICAM, and VCAM were significantly
      reduced by Atorvastatin. Cytokines, cellular adhesion molecules, and probably
      TLRs have a role in the pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.

      during conditional reasoning task.

LID - 10.25122/jml-2021-0215 [doi]
AB  - The rule-matching bias is a common error during conditional reasoning tasks,
      which refers to a tendency to match responses with the lexical context in the
      conditional rule and leads to incorrect responses. Conditional reasoning is one
      of the higher-level cognitive abilities affected by many cognitive skills. We
      aimed to determine whether inhibition and set-shifting skills with rule-matching 
      bias occurrence could be related and, if so, to what quantitative, at a
      statistically significant level. A total of 30 healthy university students aged
      18 to 30 participated in this study. We used the Wason's Selection Task (WST) to 
      measure conditional reasoning and investigated their inhibition and set-shifting 
      skills with the Stroop and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, respectively. Results
      showed a significant positive correlation between the number of correct responses
      to the Stroop test and the Wason Selection Card Test (p=0.614). There was a
      positive correlation between the number of correct responses to the Wisconsin
      Card Sorting Test and the Wason Selection Card Test (p=0.423). Participants with 
      higher inhibition and set-shifting abilities showed better performance in the
      conditional reasoning test and lower rule-matching bias errors.

AB  - Energy and plastic potential dysfunction of erythrocytes and lymphocytes among
      people with inflammatory breast cancer, infiltrative stomach cancer, and
      infiltrative colon cancer is characterized by a more aggressive clinical course
      and poor prognosis. We explored the features of energy metabolism and phosphorus 
      metabolism disorders in the erythrocytes and lymphocytes of patients with
      inflammatory breast cancer, infiltrative stomach cancer, and infiltrative colon
      cancer as a predicting factor in the course of the disease. 49 people were
      examined; the 1(st) group had infiltrative stomach cancer (n=17); the 2(nd) group
      had infiltrative colon cancer (n=11); the 3(rd) group had inflammatory breast
      cancer (n=21). Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was 1.8 times reduced 
      (p</=0.005), and the activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in
      erythrocytes of patients with cancer at the main localization increased 2.5
      times, compared with normal. Inflammatory breast cancer patients had a
      statistically significant decrease (p<0.005) in erythrocytes adenosine
      triphosphate content by an average of 56.5% compared with the normal ratio, and
      in cases of patients with gastric and colorectal cancer, a decrease of 67%.
      Excessive use of phosphorus for energy metabolism and adenosine triphosphate
      production destroys the balance of energetic and plastic potentials of
      erythrocytes and lymphocytes in inflammatory breast cancer, infiltrative stomach,
      and infiltrative colorectal cancers patients.

AB  - This study aimed to specify Pentacam indices in patients who suffered from
      different types of refractive error and underwent photorefractive keratectomy
      (PRK) surgery. It is a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out on 1125
      patients (2215 eye samples) who underwent PRK surgery in the Noor Surgical Center
      of Ardabil, Iran, over a 5 year period (2014-2018). A particular checklist was
      provided to patients, which consisted of demographic data, pachymetry test,
      keratometry, refractive error, corneal-thickness indices, and corneal surface
      area indices. The data were analysed using the statistical analysis package of
      IBM((R)) V25. The mean age of the participants in this study was 28.48+/-6.82
      years, and the ratio of women to men was 66.4%. It was observed that the
      differences between angle, volume, the depth of the anterior chamber, IVA, and
      ISV were significant (P=0.00) when compared to each other in all types of
      refractive errors. High myopes had significantly higher Kmax front than low
      myopes (P=0.00). In astigmatism patients, the Kmax in front of the cornea in
      extreme type was significantly higher than in moderate (P=0.00) and high (P=0.01)
      types. High myopes had significantly lower Rmin than mild myopes (P=0.02), and
      extreme astigmatism had significantly lower Rmin than high (P=0.014) and moderate
      types (P=0.013). The data from this study revealed that in patients undergoing
      PRK surgery, some Pentacam indices could be related to some types of refractive
      error, and in some of these indices, there are statistically significant
      differences between different severities of refractive errors. Therefore, their
      preoperative evaluation is very important.

AB  - Miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy. Moreover, vitamin D
      deficiency is a prevalent concern among women of reproductive age, particularly
      in the Arab world, where the link between vitamin D deficiency and miscarriage is
      still unknown. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between
      vitamin D and miscarriage by comparing the concentration of vitamin D among women
      with spontaneous abortion and pregnant women. A total of 80 subjects were
      enrolled in this study and divided into two groups. The first group included 40
      women with spontaneous abortions aged between 18 and 40 years. The second group
      included 40 pregnant women without previous history of miscarriages. Total
      25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH-VD) measurement was estimated with a Dry Fluorescence
      Immunoassay analyzer using the Lansionbio LS-1100 instrument. The relationship
      between the five age groups and the vitamin D status of women with spontaneous
      abortion was not significant (p>0.05). There was no significant relationship
      between the miscarriage trimesters and vitamin D status (p>0.05) and between the 
      five age groups (p>0.05). In our study, 95% of women with spontaneous abortion
      had vitamin D deficiency, compared to only 17.5% of pregnant women. A normal
      range of vitamin D improves the growth of the fetus and prevents pregnancy
      complications and miscarriage, promoting the growth of blood vessels in the
      placenta and improving the function of immune cells.

AB  - Patients with hemodialysis face various problems with self-care behavior.
      Therefore, these patients need to control and manage adherence to enhance
      self-care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has particularly high
      morbidity in the elderly and co-morbid peoples. Self-efficacy was identified as a
      number of psychological factors that improve adherence and treatment outcomes
      among hemodialysis patients. This study aimed to investigate self-efficacy among 
      patients with hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. A comparative
      descriptive research design was used to conduct the study. A convenience sample
      of 95 hemodialysis patients (male and females) was selected from Port-Said city, 
      Egypt, and 115 hemodialysis patients (male and females) were selected from Saudi 
      Arabia. Data collection included a structured interview with three parts
      assessing socio-demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, and
      self-efficacy. This study revealed a statistically significant difference between
      Egyptian and Saudi hemodialysis patients, mainly in the main score and levels of 
      self-efficacy (p=0.001). There is a significant relationship between
      socio-demographic characteristics and chronic disease self-efficiency among
      Egyptian hemodialysis patients in terms of sex, age, marital status, work, and
      level of education.

TI  - An Analysis by the European Committee on Organ Transplantation of the Council of 
      Europe Outlining the International Landscape of Donors and Recipients Sex in
      Solid Organ Transplantation.

AB  - Discrepancies in donation and transplantation by sex and gender have previously
      been reported. However, whether such differences are invariably the inevitable,
      unintended outcome of a legitimate process has yet to be determined. The European
      Committee on Organ Transplantation of the Council of Europe (CD-P-TO) is the
      committee that actively promotes the development of ethical, quality and safety
      standards in the field of transplantation in Europe. Whilst the ultimate
      objective is to shed light on the processes underlying potential gender
      inequities in transplantation, our initial goal was to represent the distribution
      by sex among organ donors and recipients in the CD-P-TO Member States and
      observer countries. Our survey confirms previous evidence that, in most
      countries, men represent the prevalent source of deceased donors (63.3% in 64
      countries: 60.7% and 71.9% for donation after brain and circulatory death,
      respectively). In contrast, women represent the leading source of organs
      recovered from living kidney and liver donors (61.1% and 51.2% in 55 and 32
      countries, respectively). Across countries, most recovered organs are
      transplanted into men (65% in 57 countries). These observations may be explained,
      at least in part, by the higher burden of certain diseases in men, childbearing
      related immune sensitization in women, and donor-recipient size mismatch. Future 
      research should establish whether gender-related socially-constructed roles and
      socioeconomic status may play a detrimental role reducing the access of women to 
      transplantation.

TI  - Impact of the Cardioplegia Interval on Myocardial Protection Using the Modified
      St. Thomas Solution in Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Surgery: A Double-Center
      Study.
PG  - 135-141
LID - 10.1182/ject-135-141 [doi]
AB  - It has been reported that a single-dose cardioplegia interval is useful, but the 
      safe interval doses are not clear. We aimed to investigate the impact of the
      cardioplegia interval on myocardial protection using the modified St. Thomas
      solution. We included consecutive isolated minimally invasive mitral
      valvuloplasty procedures (n = 229) performed at a hospital and medical center
      from January 2014 to December 2020. We compared postoperative peak creatine
      kinase MB and creatine kinase levels and other indicators between the short
      (Group S, n = 135; maximum myocardial protection interval <60 minutes) and long
      (Group L, n = 94; maximum myocardial protection interval >/=60 minutes) interval 
      groups. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for confounders between the 
      two groups. After propensity score matching, Groups S and L contained 47 patients
      each. Groups S and L did not differ significantly in peak creatine kinase MB
      (45.8 +/- 26.3 IU/L and 41.5 +/- 27.9 IU/L, respectively; p = .441) and creatine 
      kinase levels (1,133 +/- 567 IU/L and 1,100 +/- 916 IU/L, respectively; p = .837)
      after admission to the intensive care unit on the day of surgery based on
      propensity score matching. In multivariate analysis, a cardioplegia dosing
      interval >/=60 minutes was not significantly associated with the maximum creatine
      kinase MB level after admission to the intensive care unit on the day of surgery 
      (p = .354; 95% confidence interval: -1.67 to 4.65). Using the antegrade modified 
      St. Thomas solution, the long interval dose method is useful and safe in
      minimally invasive mitral valvuloplasty.

      Prospective observational study.
PG  - 307
LID - 10.25259/SNI_455_2022 [doi]
AB  - Background: Pharmacological treatment for chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH)
      recurrence prevention after surgery is under debate. CSDH may be related to
      suidoku (fluid disturbance) from the Japanese herbal kampo perspective. Goreisan 
      (GRS) treats suidoku and is used to prevent a postoperative recurrence. However, 
      not all CSDHs are liquid, and some have structures such as trabecula, hematoma,
      and clots, suggesting oketsu (blood stasis). Therefore, we prospectively
      investigated the keishibukuryogan (KBG) effectiveness, which treats oketsu, for
      CSDH recurrence prevention and hematoma resolution compared to GRS. Methods: We
      prospectively prescribed KBG 7.5 g/day for 12 CSDH patients after burr-hole
      surgery. As a control cohort, we retrospectively collected 48 patients treated by
      GRS 7.5 g/day. The recurrence within 1 month and the hematoma thickness after 1
      month were evaluated. Results: The median age was 84 years old. All the patients'
      symptoms improved after surgery. The median preoperative midline shift and mean
      hematoma thicknesses were 6.0 mm and 23.75 mm. Those at 1 month were 2.0 mm and
      11.43 mm. The recurrence rate was not significantly different between the KBG
      cohort (1 of 12) and the GRS cohort (4 of 48) (P = 0.999). The KBG's
      noninferiority to GRS regarding the hematoma thickness at 1 month was
      statistically proven; KBG (12.26 mm) and GRS (11.20 mm). Conclusion: The
      recurrence rate at 1 month was not different between the KBG and GRS cohorts. The
      hematoma thickness at 1 month in the KBG cohort was not statistically inferior to
      that in the GRS cohort.

      malignant gliomas?
PG  - 320
LID - 10.25259/SNI_438_2022 [doi]
AB  - Background: Glioblastoma (GB) is well known for being the most aggressive primary
      cerebral malignancy. The peak incidence is at 60-70 years of age, with over half 
      of patients aged over 65 years at diagnosis. Methods: Patients with a confirmed
      histological diagnosis of GB between January 2009 and June 2016 at a single
      center were retrospectively identified. The inclusion criteria for the study were
      age over 65 years at diagnosis, and surgical management with either a burr hole
      biopsy or craniotomy. Results: A total of n = 289 patients underwent surgery for 
      GB, with a median age at diagnosis of 71 years, and of whom 64% were male.
      Craniotomies were performed in 71%, with burr hole biopsies performed in the
      remainder (29%). Patient survival differed significantly with treatment modality 
      (P < 0.001), ranging from a median of 382 days in those treated with a
      combination of craniotomy, radiotherapy (RT), and temozolomide (TZM), to 43 days 
      in those only receiving a burr hole biopsy with no further treatment. On
      multivariable analysis, treatment with RT + TZM was significantly independently
      associated with longer patient survival (P < 0.001). Craniotomy was associated
      with a significant improvement in performance status, compared to burr hole
      biopsy (P = 0.006). For the subgroup of patients receiving TZM, those with a
      methylated O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) status had
      significantly longer overall survival than those with unmethylated MGMT (median: 
      407 vs. 341 days, P = 0.039). Conclusion: Our retrospective data demonstrate that
      the elderly population with GB benefit from aggressive chemo-RT, regardless of
      surgical intervention.

TI  - Spheno-orbital meningiomas: Is orbit reconstruction mandatory? Long-term outcomes
      and exophthalmos improvement.
PG  - 318
LID - 10.25259/SNI_165_2022 [doi]
AB  - Background: Meningiomas correspond to one-third of all primary central nervous
      system tumors. Approximately 9% of them are spheno-orbital meningiomas (SOMs),
      presenting significant clinical symptoms as visual impairment and orbital
      esthetics. This article aims to evaluate exophthalmos' improvement in a surgical 
      series without orbital reconstruction. Methods: We consecutively included all
      patients diagnosed with SOM, admitted to a single institution for 10 years.
      Surgical resection was the standard of care, associated or not with adjuvant
      radiation therapy. The radiological investigation included preoperative and
      postoperative head CT or MRI. We quantified proptosis through imaging. Results:
      Forty patients composed this series, 87.5% were female. Proptosis was the most
      common presentation (90%), followed by decreased visual acuity (65%), motility
      deficit (20%), and headache (20%). Gross total resection was achieved in 65% of
      the procedures. In late outcomes, 78% of the patients maintained or improved
      visual acuity and 85% maintained or improved headache. Proptosis significantly
      improved after surgery and along with the follow-up (P < 0.001). Ten patients
      were submitted to adjuvant RT, six of them after a subtotal resection. All
      patients of this subgroup had proptosis. It was observed a higher frequency of
      worse in visual acuity in patients submitted to RT (71% vs. 28%, P = 0.038).
      Conclusion: Resection of SOM was sufficient to stop the evolution of visual
      deficit and allowed the improvement of proptosis. Orbital reconstruction does not
      seem to be an essential step in reducing enophthalmos.

AB  - Background: The costs of cervical spine surgery have steadily increased. We
      performed a 5-year propensity scoring-matched analysis of 276 patients undergoing
      anterior versus posterior cervical surgery at one institution. Methods: We
      performed propensity score matching on financial data from 276 patients
      undergoing 1-3 level anterior versus posterior cervical fusions for degenerative 
      disease (2015-2019). Results: We found no significant difference between anterior
      versus posterior approaches for hospital costs ($42,529.63 vs. $45,110.52), net
      revenue ($40,877.25 vs. $34,036.01), or contribution margins ($14,230.19 vs.
      $6,312.54). Multivariate regression analysis showed variables significantly
      associated with the lower contribution margins included age (beta = -392.3) and
      length of stay (LOS; beta = -1151). Removing age/LOS from the analysis,
      contribution margins were significantly higher for the anterior versus posterior 
      approach ($17,824.16 vs. $6,312.54, P = 0.01). Conclusion: Anterior cervical
      surgery produced higher contribution margins compared to posterior approaches,
      most likely because posterior surgery was typically performed in older patients
      requiring longer LOS.

TI  - Association Between Beta-Carotene Supplementation and Mortality: A Systematic
      Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 872310
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.872310 [doi]
AB  - Background: Aging is a phenomenon universally involving all organisms,
      genetically determined, and epigenetically influenced by the environment.
      Numerous observational studies have shown the positive impact of
      non-pharmacological approaches started in younger age on chronic conditions
      affecting the elderly health and survival. This meta-analysis aimed to
      investigate the effect of beta-carotene on the total and cause-specific mortality
      as reported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We searched Medline,
      Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL Cochrane from inception to September 2021.
      Studies were eligible if enrolled adults with any health condition, compared
      beta-carotene supplements at any dose with placebo or no intervention, provided
      information on deaths from any cause, and were RCTs, in English. The risk of bias
      was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE. Risk ratios and
      their 95% confidence intervals were used and a P-value less than 0.05 was
      considered statistically significant. Results: Among 3,942 articles searched, 44 
      articles on 31 RCTs, which included 216,734 total subjects, 108,622 in
      beta-carotene supplement groups, and 108,112 in the placebo or no-intervention
      groups, were involved in the final analyses. In a random-effects meta-analysis of
      all 31 trials, beta-carotene supplements were found to have no preventive effect 
      on mortality (risk ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.05, I (2) = 42%).
      Further, the analysis showed no preventive effect on cancer, cardiovascular,
      cerebrovascular, and other mortality causes. Instead, beta-carotene
      supplementation significantly increased the risk of lung cancer mortality (RR
      1.14, 95% CI 1.02, 1.27, I (2) = 3%) but decreased the risk of human
      immunodeficiency virus-related mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33, 0.92, I (2) = 0).
      Conclusion: More studies should be performed to better define the role of
      beta-carotene on survival, to confirm or deny our results. Therefore, the
      possible beneficial or harmful effects of the beta-carotene supplementation on
      mortality must not be overstated. Systematic Review Registration:

AB  - Increased blood pressure (BP) has been associated with higher risk of stroke and 
      mortality in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). We investigated risk factors associated
      with Relative Systemic Hypertension (RSH) or systemic hypertension in SCD
      patients in Cameroon. Using R, Multivariate multinomial logistic regression
      modeling was used to examine the effects of the demographic, anthropometric,
      clinical, and laboratory factors to determine risk factors. A total of 815
      individuals with SCD, including 380 (46.6%) males were analyzed. At baseline, the
      median age [interquartile range] was 18.0 [12.0-25.0] years, ranging from 3 to 66
      years. Approximately three-quarters of the patients (n = 645; 79.1%) had normal
      BP, 151 (18.5%) had RSH and 19 (2.3%) had hypertension. Age (P < 0.001) and
      gender (P = 0.022) were significantly different across the BP categories. Weight 
      (P < 0.001), height (P < 0.001), BMI (P < 0.001), pulse pressure (P = 0.020),
      history of stroke (P = 0.012), hemoglobin level (P = 0.002), red blood cell count
      (P = 0.031), creatinine (P < 0.001), and (estimated glomerular filtration rate)
      eGFR (P = 0.002) was also significantly different across the three BP categories.
      After adjustment, the significantly associated factors of RSH in the SCD patients
      were age [OR = 1.03, (95% CI = 1.01-1.06), P < 0.010], male gender [OR = 1.54,
      (95% CI = 1.04-2.27), P = 0.029], BMI [OR = 1.10, (95% CI = 1.04-1.17), P =
      0.001]. After adjustment, the independent variables significantly associated
      factors of Hypertension in the SCD patients were age [OR = 1.05, (95% CI =
      1.01-1.10), P = 0.034], male gender [OR = 3.31, (95% CI = 1.04-10.52), P =
      0.042], BMI [OR = 1.14, (95% CI = 1.01-1.29), P = 0.027]. Creatinine was
      significantly associated with RSH [OR =1.31 (1.05-1.63), P = 0.016]. SCD patients
      with RSH or hypertension maybe at increased risk of renal dysfunction. We found
      relatively high prevalence of RSH and hypertension (20.8%) in SCD patients in
      Cameroon. Tailored Interventions that consider major risk factors (age, gender,
      and BMI) may lower BP pressure and prevent severe complications.

AB  - Immunoglobulin (Ig) production during and after infection with Plasmodium
      parasites is one of the greatest adaptive immune defenses the human host has
      against this parasite. Infection with P. falciparum has been shown to induce
      different B cell maturation responses dependent upon the age of the patient,
      number of previous exposures, and severity of the disease. Described here are
      dynamics of Ig responses to a panel of 32 P. falciparum antigens by patients
      followed for 42 days and classified individuals as showing characteristics of an 
      apparent first P. falciparum infection (naive) or a repeat exposure (non-naive). 
      Six parameters were modeled to characterize the dynamics of IgM, IgG1, IgG3, and 
      IgA for these two exposure groups with differences assessed among Ig
      isotypes/subclasses and unique antigens. Naive patients had significantly longer 
      periods of time to reach peak Ig titer (range 4-7 days longer) and lower maximum 
      Ig titers when compared with non-naive patients. Modeled time to seronegativity
      was significantly higher in non-naive patients for IgM and IgA, but not for the
      two IgG subclasses. IgG1 responses to Rh2030, HSP40, and PfAMA1 were at the
      highest levels for non-naive participants and may be used to predict previous or 
      nascent exposure by themselves. The analyses presented here demonstrate the
      differences in the development of the Ig response to P. falciparum if the
      infection represents a boosting response or a primary exposure. Consistency in Ig
      isotype/subclasses estimates and specific data for P. falciparum antigens can
      better guide interpretation of seroepidemiological data among symptomatic
      persons.

TI  - Androgen receptor polymorphism, testosterone levels, and prognosis in patients
      with acute myocardial infarction.
PG  - oeab023
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeab023 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Low testosterone has been associated with cardiovascular disease in men but
      with contradictory findings. Testosterone bind to the androgen receptor and
      polymorphisms of the receptor gene such as CAG repeat length may affect
      transcriptional activity, possibly mitigating testosterone effects. The aims were
      to study the CAG repeat length and testosterone levels at four time points
      following a myocardial infarction (MI) and to analyse possible relationships
      between CAG repeat length and cardiovascular prognosis. Methods and results: Male
      patients admitted for acute MI (n = 122) from the Glucose in Acute Myocardial
      Infarction study were included. Blood samples were drawn at four time points (day
      after admission, at discharge, and at 3 and 12 months post-infarction) for
      assessment of testosterone levels. Patients were followed for a median of 11.6
      years. Cox regression analyses were performed for CAG repeat length by one unit
      increment and by > vs. </=median for cardiovascular events and all-cause
      mortality. Median CAG repeat length was 20. There was no difference in
      testosterone levels at each time point when dividing the cohort into </= vs. >CAG
      repeat median (=20). There was no association between CAG repeat length either as
      a continuous or categorical variable in unadjusted and age-adjusted Cox analyses 
      for cardiovascular events. While CAG >20 was associated with all-cause mortality 
      in unadjusted analyses (hazard ratio 2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.13-4.22; P =
      0.02), it did not remain significant following adjustment for age. Conclusion:
      CAG repeat length was not associated with testosterone levels or prognosis in men
      with acute MI.

AB  - Background: Clinicians have limited time during patient encounters which can
      result in patients' concerns not being addressed. This study's objective was to
      test whether an electronic patient-reported outcome quality of life tool (PROQOL)
      in which patients identify their primary concern during clinic visits improves
      cancer patient quality of life (QOL). Patients and methods: This single center
      non-blinded prospective clinical trial randomized patients (2:1) to PROQOL versus
      usual care (UC). Two patient cohorts were enrolled: those with hematologic
      malignancies (multiple myeloma [MM] or light chain amyloidosis [AL]) and solid
      tumors (head and neck [H/N] or gynecologic [GYN] malignancies). Primary endpoint 
      was patient-reported QOL at 12 months measured by a single-item Linear Analog
      Self-Assessment. Value to patients and impact on clinician workflow was measured 
      using a "was it worth it" survey. The study was powered to detect a 0.5 standard 
      deviation difference between groups. Results: Overall 383 patients were enrolled,
      171 with MM, 62 AL, 113 GYN, and 37 H/N between July 2016 and April 2018, with
      12-month follow-up. There were 171 (44.6%) male patients and median age was 62
      years (range 31-87). The most often selected concern was physical health (30.9%),
      and second was cancer diagnosis and treatment (29.1%). Mean QOL was 7.12 for
      PROQOL and 6.98 for UC (0-10 scale) at 12 months, with no between-group
      difference overall (p = 0.56) or within hematologic or solid tumor cohorts,
      respectively. Among patients, 74% thought the PROQOL tool was worthwhile, 86%
      would choose PROQOL again, and 81% would recommend it to others. Among
      clinicians, 95% responded that PROQOL was worthwhile and did not think that
      PROQOL negatively impacted their workflow. Conclusions: Although we did not
      demonstrate a QOL difference between PROQOL and UC groups; the PROQOL tool held
      considerable value in identifying patients' main concerns over time and was
      worthwhile for patients and clinicians.

TI  - Xiongshao Zhitong Recipe Attenuates Nitroglycerin-Induced Migraine-Like Behaviors
      via the Inhibition of Inflammation Mediated by Nitric Oxide Synthase.
PG  - 920201
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.920201 [doi]
AB  - Migraine is a major cause of disability worldwide, particularly in young adults
      and middle-aged women. Xiongshao Zhitong Recipe (XZR) is a traditional Chinese
      medicine prescription used for treating migraine, but its bioactive components
      and therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to confirm the therapeutic
      effect of XZR on migraine and to determine the possible mechanism and bioactive
      components of XZR. Here, a sensitive UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS assay was carried out 
      to analyze the ingredients of XZR, and a total of 62 components were identified, 
      including coumarins, phenolic acids, phthalides, flavonoids, and terpenoids;
      among them, 15 components were identified in the serum samples after XZR
      treatment. We established a rat model of migraine via nitroglycerin (NTG)
      injection. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that XZR attenuated allodynia and
      photophobia in rats with NTG-induced migraine, and XZR also demonstrated
      analgesic effects. XZR reversed the abnormal levels of nitric oxide,
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance
      P (SP) to normal levels. XZR also downregulated inflammatory reactions, including
      mast cell degranulation and serum IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels. In terms 
      of mechanism, we revealed that XZR treated NTG-induced migraine through the
      inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible nitric oxide
      synthase (iNOS) expression in both the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and
      periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), as well as the total NOS enzyme activity, which
      regulated the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Additionally, imperatorin and
      xanthotoxin, two major ingredients of XZR, showed a high binding affinity to nNOS
      (Gly468-Leu616). In vitro, XZR, imperatorin, and xanthotoxin inhibited the nNOS
      expression and the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS)-stimulated PC12 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated the therapeutic
      effects of XZR and provided evidence that XZR played a critical anti-inflammatory
      role by suppressing NOS and NF-kappaB signaling pathway activation. Imperatorin
      and xanthotoxin were potential bioactive components of XZR. The findings from
      this study supported that XZR was a candidate herbal drug for migraine therapy.

TI  - Studies on Chemical Characterization of Ginkgo Amillaria Oral Solution and Its
      Drug-Drug Interaction With Piceatannol 3'-O-beta-D-Glucopyranoside for Injection.
PG  - 932646
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.932646 [doi]
AB  - Ginkgo Amillaria oral solution (GAO) is commonly used for the treatment of
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in China.
      Piceatannol-3'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside for injection (PGI) is mainly used for
      the prevention and treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. With the
      spread of cerebrovascular disease, the possibility of combining the two drugs has
      increased; however, there is no research on the drug-drug interaction (DDI)
      between these two medicines. In this paper, an ultrahigh-performance liquid
      chromatography/quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap MS) method
      was established to characterize the chemical constituents of GAO first; 62
      compounds were identified or tentatively identified based on their retention time
      (RT), MS, and MS/MS data. Nine main compounds were determined by
      ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry
      (UPLC-QQQ-MS). Furthermore, incubation with liver microsomes in vitro was
      fulfilled; the results showed that GAO had a significant inhibitory effect on
      UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 (p < 0.05), and PGI was mainly metabolized by UGT1A9. The
      identification results of in vivo metabolites of PGI showed that PGI mainly
      undergoes a phase II binding reaction mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
      (UGT) and sulfotransferase (SULT) in vivo. Therefore, pharmacokinetic studies
      were performed to investigate the DDI between GAO and PGI. The results showed
      that the AUC (p < 0.05) and T1/2 (p < 0.05) of PGI in vivo were significantly
      increased when administered together with GAO, whereas the CL was significantly
      decreased (p < 0.05). The exploration of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed 
      that there was a DDI between GAO and PGI.

      Pharmacoepidemiological Evidence From Yemen.
PG  - 926449
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.926449 [doi]
AB  - Background: Recent research indicates irrational use of herbal medicine (HM)
      during pregnancy that can be harmful to the mother and development of baby.
      However, no study has been conducted to explore the use of HM among pregnant
      women in a conflict region. Methods: This was a cross-sectional research
      conducted in July and August in the year 2017, at three hospitals in Sana'a,
      Yemen. Postpartum women were interviewed via the structured instrument to collect
      data on patterns of HM used during pregnancy. Results: A total of three hundred
      postpartum women participated in the study, with 59.3% (178) of them using at
      least one modality of HM in the previous pregnancy. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum
      L), ginger (Zingiber officinale Z), barley (Hordeum vulgare P), and garlic
      (Allium sativum A) were the most commonly used HM. Statistical analysis showed
      that consumers of HM had a higher rate of caesarian section and complications
      during and after the delivery. Conclusion: Consumption of HM during pregnancy was
      high including contraindicated modalities such as cinnamon (C. verum L) and
      barley (H. vulgare P). The use of potentially harmful modalities and association 
      with complications pose a threat to the well-being of mothers and newborns.
      Further studies in this area will be helpful to generate evidence for the
      rational use of HM during pregnancy.

TI  - The Efficacy and Safety of Diyushengbai Tablet on Preventing and Treating
      Leukopenia Caused by Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy Against Tumor: A Systematic
      Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 827710
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.827710 [doi]
AB  - Background: Leukopenia is one of the side effects of radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy. Diyushengbai tablet (DYT) is used to prevent and treat leukopenia
      caused by various reasons. A meta-analysis was performed to systematically
      analyze the therapeutic effects of DYT on preventing and treating leukopenia
      caused by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Objectives: This study aimed to
      systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of DYT in preventing and treating
      leukopenia caused by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Methods: We performed a
      comprehensive literature search of electronic databases such as PubMed, The
      Cochrane Library, China Knowledge Network (CNKI), China Biomedical Literature
      Database (CBM), Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and VIP, through
      November of 2021. The scanning reports deadline is until November 2021. The bias 
      risk evaluation criteria developed by the Cochrane collaborative organization
      were used to evaluate the literature quality of the included studies. The
      RevMan5.4 software was used to analyze the data, and the Stata16.0 was used to
      perform the Egger test. Results: After selecting all the databases, a total of 41
      reports which involved 3,793 cases were analyzed. Meta-analysis showed that DYT
      could significantly reduce the white blood cell (WBC) suppression caused by
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy and improve the patients' WBC counts and
      neutrophils, compared with the efficacy of other oral WBC-elevating drugs such as
      Leucogen tablets and Batilol tablets and additional utilization of granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The results of meta-analysis showed that for
      preventive medication purpose, the overall incidence of leukocyte suppression was
      [RR = 0.74, 95%CI (0.59, 0.92), p = 0.006], and the white blood cell count was
      [MD = 1.12, 95%CI (0.95, 1.29), p < 0.00001]; while for therapeutic purpose, the 
      incidence of overall leukocyte suppression was [RR = 0.61, 95%CI (0.38, 0.95), p 
      = 0.03], and the white blood cell count was [MD = 1.20, 95%CI (0.77, 1.62), p <
      0.00001]. More importantly, the additional use of DYT can reduce the application 
      amount of G-CSF. The results showed that the application of G-CSF can be reduced 
      by an average of 1.57 from the beginning of treatment to return normal white
      blood cells around 2.23 in two cycles of chemotherapy. Conclusion: DYT is more
      effective in preventing and treating leukopenia caused by radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy than other oral WBC-elevating drugs, which have a high clinical
      value.

AB  - Stress is a physiological consequence of the body to adversity. The gut-brain
      axis and probiotics are gaining interest to provide better treatment for stress
      and other neurological disorders. Probiotic (Lactobacillus fermentum NMCC-14 and 
      Bacillus clausii, 10(10) colony-forming unit/day/animal, per oral) effects were
      investigated in acute (up to day 7) and subacute (days 8-14) restraint-stressed
      and normal mice through behavioral paradigms (elevated plus maze: EPM, light dark
      box/dark light box: LDB, and open field test: OFT). Time spent in the open arms
      of the EPM, time spent in the light compartment of the LDB, and movable time and 
      time spent in the center of the OFT were significantly (p </= 0.05, n = 5)
      increased in probiotic-treated restraint-stressed mice. Enzyme-linked immunoassay
      determined blood cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, which
      were reduced significantly (p < 0.05, n = 5) in probiotic-treated
      restraint-stressed mice. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained hippocampal slides also
      showed less or no neurodegeneration in the probiotic-treated animals.
      High-performance liquid chromatography and quantitative polymerase chain reaction
      were performed to determine the monoamine levels and mRNA expression of dopamine 
      receptor subtypes (D1 and D2) and synaptophysin in the mice hippocampus (HC) and 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). The dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine levels were 
      also significantly (p < 0.05, n = 5) increased in the HC and PFC of
      probiotic-treated animal brains. Fold expression of mRNA of D1 and D2 (except HC,
      LF-S, day 14) receptors and synaptophysin was also significantly (p < 0.05, n =
      5) increased in the same brain parts of probiotic-treated restraint-stressed
      mice. Comparing mice in the Lactobacillus fermentum NMCC-14 and Bacillus clausii 
      groups to mice in the normal group, only a significant (p < 0.05, n = 5) decrease
      was observed in the serum ACTH and cortisol levels on day 14 in Bacillus
      clausii-treated mice, where all other parameters also showed improvement. In
      comparison, Bacillus clausii showed greater stress suppressant activity than
      Lactobacillus fermentum NMCC-14. However, both probiotic bacteria can be a better
      and safer therapeutic alternative for ailments than currently available drugs.

TI  - Call for Decision Support for High-Alert Medication Administration Among
      Pediatric Nurses: Findings From a Large, Multicenter, Cross-Sectional Survey in
      China.
PG  - 860438
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.860438 [doi]
AB  - Background: Children have a higher risk of medication errors (MEs) than adults.
      The Institute for Safe Medication Practice (ISMP) defined high-alert medications 
      (HAMs) as a group of medications that could cause significant patient harm or
      even death when they are used in error. Nurses are actively involved in and
      responsible for patient care, especially in medication administration. This study
      aimed to estimate the knowledge, decision-making basis and confidence and
      decision support needs related to HAMs among pediatric nurses in China. Methods: 
      A web-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted among pediatric nurses who were
      recruited from 14 member hospitals of the Pediatric Nursing Alliance of National 
      Children's Medical Center in China using a convenient sampling technique. Data
      were collected using a self-administered instrument composed of four parts: the
      demographic characteristics of participants, participants' knowledge about HAMs, 
      participants' self-evaluation of the basis of and confidence in decision-making, 
      and decision support needs regarding HAMs. Among the participants, the maximum
      score for HAM knowledge was 100. All data were entered and analyzed using SPSS
      20.0. Results: A total of 966 nurses participated in this study. Nurses were
      found to have insufficient knowledge about HAMs, with a median (IQR) of 75.0
      (70.0, 80.0), out of a maximum score of 100. Knowledge about HAM administration
      was significantly higher than that about HAM regulation, with a p value < 0.001. 
      The three lowest-scoring items concerned HAM regulation, and the "Treat fentanyl 
      skin patches as a regulated narcotic" item obtained the lowest score, with only
      1/5 of respondents answering it correctly. Most participants reported that their 
      basis for decision-making about HAMs was drug instructions (90.0%) or drug
      handbooks (81.9%) and evaluated their confidence in decision-making about HAMs as
      high or relatively high (84.6%). The decision-making difficulties when
      encountering HAMs focused on most stages of HAM administration, especially the
      appropriateness of prescriptions, checks, preparation and administration. The
      vast majority of participants assessed decision support as necessary or very
      necessary (92.0%), and the most popular options for decision support were
      computerized clinical decision support systems (46.4%) and real-time online
      communication with pharmacists (23.9%). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the
      inadequacies in HAM knowledge, the basis and difficulty of decision-making, and
      decision support needs regarding HAMs in Chinese pediatric nurses. Nurses need
      greater support in HAM administration, including not only training but also
      adequate technology, mutually beneficial interprofessional collaboration, and a
      positive institutional culture.

      nurses: A pilot study.
PG  - 115-120
LID - 10.29390/cjrt-2022-022 [doi]
AB  - Background: Compassionate extubation (CE) refers to withdrawing mechanical
      ventilation and allowing a patient to die peacefully at the end of life. The
      primary objective of this pilot study was to quantify the emotional impact of CE 
      on Respiratory Therapists (RT) and Registered Nurses (RNs). Methods: This pilot
      survey was conducted between March and April 2021 at an academic medical center
      among RTs and RNs. It included questions on participants' demographics, work
      characteristics, and Impact of Events (IES) scale to assess the subjective stress
      caused by CE. Data were analyzed using descriptive and chi(2) statistics.
      Results: Among 20 participants, 18 (90%) were females, 12 (60%) were in the
      20-40-year age group, 12 (60%) were RTs, and 8 (40%) RNs. Around 15 (75%)
      participants worked day shifts with a weekly average of 3-4 shifts, and 14 (70%) 
      performed/observed CE within 1 month before taking this survey. CE
      performed/observed in a month was </=2 among 15 (75%) and 3-5 among 4 (20%)
      participants. Mean total IES score was 16.7 (12.3) among all participants
      representing 7 (35%) having low, 6 (30%) moderate, and 7 (35%) high emotional
      impact when performing CE. Risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) was present in 6 (30%) participants. A significantly higher number of
      participants in the low impact group were satisfied with the institutional CE
      process (p = 0.043) than those in the medium/high impact group. Conclusion: This 
      pilot study findings reveal that RTs and RNs experience moderate to high levels
      of subjective stress when performing CE. One-third of the survey participants
      were at risk of developing PTSD.

      single-centre retrospective analysis.
PG  - 98-102
LID - 10.29390/cjrt-2022-019 [doi]
AB  - Background: The severity of disease and mortality due to coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) was found to be high among patients with concurrent medical illnesses.
      Serum biomarkers can be used to predict the course of COVID-19 pneumonia. Data
      from India are very scarce about predictors of mortality among COVID-19 patients.
      Methodology: In the present retrospective study of 65 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19
      patients, we retrieved data regarding clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters,
      and radiological grading of severity. Further, we also collected data about their
      hospital course, duration of stay, treatment, and outcome. Data analysis was done
      to compare the patient characteristics between survivor and non-survivor groups
      and to assess the predictors of mortality. Results: The mean age of the study
      population was 56.23 years (SD, 12.91) and most of them were males (63%); 81.5%
      of patients survived and were discharged, whereas 18.5% of patients succumbed to 
      the disease. Univariate analysis across both groups showed that older age,
      diabetes mellitus, higher computed tomogram (CT) severity score, and raised
      levels of laboratory parameters viz, D-dimer, CPK-MB (creatine kinase), and
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were associated with increased mortality among
      hospitalized patients. On multivariate analysis, elevated levels of serum D-dimer
      (odds ratio, 95% CI: 10.98, 1.13-106.62, p = 0.04) and LDH (odds ratio, 95% CI:
      19.15, 3.28-111.87, p = 0.001) were independently associated with mortality.
      Conclusion: Older patients, diabetics, and patients with high CT severity scores 
      at admission are at increased risk of death from COVID-19. Serum biomarkers such 
      as D-dimer and LDH help in predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on HDL cholesterol efflux and serum cholesterol
      loading capacity in familial hypercholesterolemia subjects: a multi-lipid-center 
      real-world evaluation.
PG  - 925587
LID - 10.3389/fmolb.2022.925587 [doi]
AB  - Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), beyond regulating LDL
      cholesterol (LDL-c) plasma levels, exerts several pleiotropic effects by
      modulating lipid metabolism in extrahepatic cells such as macrophages. Macrophage
      cholesterol homeostasis depends on serum lipoprotein functions, including the HDL
      capacity to promote cell cholesterol efflux (CEC) and the serum capacity to
      promote cell cholesterol loading (CLC). The aim of this observational study was
      to investigate the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9-i) treatment on HDL-CEC and 
      serum CLC in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). 31 genetically
      confirmed FH patients were recruited. Blood was collected and serum isolated at
      baseline and after 6 months of PCSK9-i treatment. HDL-CEC was evaluated through
      the main pathways with a radioisotopic cell-based assay. Serum CLC was assessed
      fluorimetrically in human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages. After treatment
      with PCSK9-i, total cholesterol and LDL-c significantly decreased (-41.6%, p <
      0.0001 and -56.7%, p < 0.0001, respectively). Total HDL-CEC was not different
      between patients before and after treatment. Conversely, despite no changes in
      HDL-c levels between the groups, ABCG1 HDL-CEC significantly increased after
      treatment (+22.2%, p < 0.0001) as well as HDL-CEC by aqueous diffusion (+7.8%, p 
      = 0.0008). Only a trend towards reduction of ABCA1 HDL-CEC was observed after
      treatment. PCSK9-i significantly decreased serum CLC (-6.6%, p = 0.0272). This
      effect was only partly related to the reduction of LDL-c levels. In conclusion,
      PCSK9-i treatment significantly increased HDL-CEC through ABCG1 and aqueous
      diffusion pathways and reduced the serum CLC in FH patients. The favorable effect
      of PCSK9-i on functional lipid profile could contribute to the cardiovascular
      benefit of these drugs in FH patients.

AB  - Purpose: Respiratory protective equipment is widely used in healthcare settings
      to protect clinicians whilst treating patients with COVID-19. However, their
      generic designs do not accommodate the variability in face shape across genders
      and ethnicities. Accordingly, they are regularly overtightened to compensate for 
      a poor fit. The present study aims at investigating the biomechanical and thermal
      loads during respirator application and the associated changes in local skin
      physiology at the skin-device interface. Materials and Methods: Sixteen healthy
      volunteers were recruited and reflected a range of gender, ethnicities and facial
      anthropometrics. Four single-use respirators were evaluated representing
      different geometries, size and material interfaces. Participants were asked to
      wear each respirator in a random order while a series of measurements were
      recorded, including interface pressure, temperature and relative humidity.
      Measures of transepidermal water loss and skin hydration were assessed pre- and
      post-respirator application, and after 20 minutes of recovery. Statistical
      analysis assessed differences between respirator designs and associations between
      demographics, interface conditions and parameters of skin health. Results:
      Results showed a statistically significant negative correlation (p < 0.05)
      between the alar width and interface pressures at the nasal bridge, for three of 
      the respirator designs. The nasal bridge site also corresponded to the highest
      pressures for all respirator designs. Temperature and humidity significantly
      increased (p < 0.05) during each respirator application. Significant increases in
      transepidermal water loss values (p < 0.05) were observed after the application
      of the respirators in females, which were most apparent at the nasal bridge.
      Conclusion: The results revealed that specific facial features affected the
      distribution of interface pressures and depending on the respirator design and
      material, changes in skin barrier function were evident. The development of
      respirator designs that accommodate a diverse range of face shapes and protect
      the end users from skin damage are required to support the long-term use of these
      devices.

TI  - Air Pollution's Impact on Cardiac Remodeling in an Experimental Model of Chagas
      Cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 830761
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.830761 [doi]
AB  - Background: Chagas disease is characterized by intense myocardial fibrosis
      stimulated by the exacerbated production of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative
      stress, and apoptosis. Air pollution is a serious public health problem and also 
      follows this same path. Therefore, air pollution might amplify the inflammatory
      response of Chagas disease and increase myocardial fibrosis. Methods: We studied 
      groups of Trypanosoma cruzi infected Sirius hamsters (Chagas=CH and Chagas
      exposed to pollution=CH+P) and 2 control groups (control healthy animals=CT and
      control exposed to pollution=CT+P). We evaluated acute phase (60 days post
      infection) and chronic phase (10 months). Echocardiograms were performed to
      assess left ventricular systolic and diastolic diameter, in addition to ejection 
      fraction. Interstitial collagen was measured by morphometry in picrosirius red
      staining tissue. The evaluation of inflammation was performed by gene and protein
      expression of cytokines IL10, IFN-gamma, and TNF; oxidative stress was quantified
      by gene expression of NOX1, MnSOD, and iNOS and by analysis of reactive oxygen
      species; and apoptosis was performed by gene expression of BCL2 and Capsase3, in 
      addition to TUNEL analysis. Results: Chagas groups had increased collagen
      deposition mainly in the acute phase, but air pollution did not increase this
      deposition. Also, Chagas groups had lower ejection fraction in the acute phase (p
      = 0.002) and again air pollution did not worsen ventricular function or dilation.
      The analysis of the inflammation and oxidative stress pathways were also not
      amplified by air pollution. Apoptosis analysis showed increased expression of
      BCL2 and Caspase3 genes in chagasic groups in the acute phase, with a marginal p 
      of 0.054 in BCL2 expression among infected groups, and TUNEL technique showed
      amplified of apoptotic cells by pollution among infected groups. Conclusions: A
      possible modulation of the apoptotic pathway was observed, inferring interference
      from air pollution in this pathway. However, it was not enough to promote a
      greater collagen deposition, or worsening ventricular function or dilation caused
      by air pollution in this model of Chagas cardiomyopathy.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has triggered a transition towards telemedicine for
      delivering outpatient care. The evidence base for telemedicine is heterogeneous
      and its efficacy remains debated. We, therefore, designed a mixed-methods
      semi-structured survey to evaluate patients' and clinicians' experiences of
      outpatient telemedicine clinics during the pandemic. One-hundred and eighty-eight
      patients and 69 clinicians from two hospitals in Gloucestershire completed the
      survey. The quantitative results for patients rated in-person and telemedicine
      appointments similarly in all areas except communication (p<0.001) and overall
      quality (p=0.004), both in favour of in-person consultations, while clinicians
      rated all aspects of telemedicine appointments as inferior, with the exception of
      convenience (p=0.643). Qualitative analysis highlighted themes of communication
      and relationship building difficulties, confidentiality concerns, loss of visual 
      inspection as a clinical tool and debatable time efficiency associated with
      telemedicine. Significant adaptation of current telemedicine services is required
      before it will be integrated into current practice.

      doctors' rotas and leave.
PG  - 166-170
LID - 10.7861/fhj.2022-0022 [doi]
AB  - Background: In order to provide safe, high-quality hospital care, it is essential
      that doctors are optimally deployed. Digital platforms for rostering doctors
      improves both the quality of hospital care and the wellbeing of doctors. We
      evaluated the usability and acceptability of the HealthRota((c)) e-rostering
      system. Methods: We circulated an electronic survey among doctors with
      current/previous experience of using HealthRota, and measured usability (with a
      system usability score (SUS)) and acceptability. We collected data on how doctors
      believed HealthRota affected wellbeing, patient safety and training. Results:
      There were 209 responses (67 non-training clinical fellows, 114 training doctors 
      and 27 consultants) from an estimated 350 doctors who have used HealthRota.
      Overall, the median SUS score was 86/100 (interquartile range (IQR) 75-97), and
      there were no differences by role (p=0.118), age (p=0.632) or years of experience
      (p=0.963). The median Likert score for recommending HealthRota to a colleague was
      5/5 (IQR 4-5). There were no differences in role (p=0.477), age (p=0.904) or
      years of experience (p=0.930). Doctors suggested that HealthRota improves patient
      safety (4/5 (IQR 3-5)), junior doctor training (4/5 (IQR 3-5)), doctor wellbeing 
      (4/5 (IQR 3-5)) and out-of-hours cover (4/5 (IQR 3-5)). Conclusion: HealthRota is

TI  - Patient Age and Surgical Intervention as Risk Factors for the Development of
      Osteoarthritis After Posterior Shoulder Instability: A Population-Based Study.
PG  - 23259671221112973
LID - 10.1177/23259671221112973 [doi]
AB  - Background: Diagnosis and treatment of posterior shoulder instability (PSI) has
      improved with advances in imaging and surgical technique. However, the
      relationship between PSI and osteoarthritis (OA) remains unclear. Purpose: To
      evaluate a population-based cohort to (1) determine the rate of symptomatic OA,
      (2) identify patient characteristic risk factors for OA, and (3) evaluate the
      effect of posterior capsulolabral repair on OA progression. Study Design:
      Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: After review of 324 patient
      records, we included 115 patients (14 female, 101 male) diagnosed with PSI
      between January 1994 and July 2012 with an average follow-up of 12.5 years
      (range, 5-23 years). Medical records were reviewed for patient characteristics,
      injury characteristics, surgical details (if any), and radiographic progression
      of OA. Kaplan-Meier survival was used to estimate survival free of OA;
      characteristics associated with OA progression were determined via univariate Cox
      regression models, and associated 95% CIs and hazard ratios (HRs) are presented. 
      Results: Overall, 14% (16/115) of patients had radiographic progression of
      symptomatic glenohumeral arthritis, with 5-year survival of 88.3% (95% CI,
      79.7%-97.3%). Older age at the time of instability diagnosis was associated with 
      arthritis progression (10-year unit HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.26-3.03). Patients who
      underwent surgery demonstrated increased radiographic progression of OA (HR,
      4.03; 95% CI, 1.23-13.23). There was a trend of increased OA in patients treated 
      with labral debridement compared with repair despite lower baseline levels of OA;
      however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = .09). Conclusion:
      Symptomatic glenohumeral arthritis is not seen routinely in patients with PSI.
      Although uncommon, an age of at least 30 years at the time of diagnosis and
      surgical intervention were identified as risk factors for developing symptomatic 
      arthritis at long-term follow-up.

TI  - Can Patients Read, Understand, and Act on Online Resources for Anterior Cruciate 
      Ligament Surgery?
PG  - 23259671221089977
LID - 10.1177/23259671221089977 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patients undergoing elective procedures often utilize online
      educational materials to familiarize themselves with the surgical procedure and
      expected postoperative recovery. While the Internet is easily accessible and
      ubiquitous today, the ability of patients to read, understand, and act on these
      materials is unknown. Purpose: To evaluate online resources about anterior
      cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery utilizing measures of readability,
      understandability, and actionability. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level 
      of evidence, 4. Methods: Using the term "ACL surgery," 2 independent searches
      were performed utilizing a public search engine (Google.com). Patient education
      materials were identified from the top 50 results. Audiovisual materials, news
      articles, materials intended for advertising or medical professionals, and
      materials unrelated to ACL surgery were excluded. Readability was quantified
      using the Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Simple Measure of
      Gobbledygook, Coleman-Liau Index, Automated Readability Index, and Gunning Fog
      Index. The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Printable Materials
      (PEMAT-P) was utilized to assess the actionability and understandability of
      materials. For each online source, the relationship between its Google search
      rank (from first to last) and its readability, understandability, and
      actionability was calculated utilizing the Spearman rank correlation coefficient 
      (rhoS). Results: Overall, we identified 68 unique websites, of which 39 met
      inclusion criteria. The mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level was 10.08 +/- 2.34, with 
      no website scoring at or below the 6th-grade level. Mean understandability and
      actionability scores were 59.18 +/- 10.86 (range, 33.64-79.17) and 34.41 +/-
      22.31 (range, 0.00-81.67), respectively. Only 5 (12.82%) and 1 (2.56%) resource
      scored above the 70% adequate PEMAT-P threshold mark for understandability and
      actionability, respectively. Readability (lowest P value = .103),
      understandability (rhoS = -0.13; P = .441), and actionability (rhoS = 0.28; P =
      .096) scores were not associated with Google rank. Conclusion: Patient education 
      materials on ACL surgery scored poorly with respect to readability,
      understandability, and actionability. No online resource scored at the
      recommended reading level of the American Medical Association or National
      Institutes of Health. Only 5 resources scored above the proven threshold for
      understandability, and only 1 resource scored above it for actionability.
