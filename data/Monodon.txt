TI  - Long-term and serious harms of medical cannabis and cannabinoids for chronic
      pain: a systematic review of non-randomised studies.
PG  - e054282

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of long-term and serious harms of medical 
      cannabis for chronic pain. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA
      SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CENTRAL from inception to 1 April 2020.
      STUDY SELECTION: Non-randomised studies reporting on harms of medical cannabis or
      cannabinoids in adults or children living with chronic pain with >/=4 weeks of
      follow-up. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A parallel guideline panel provided
      input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including
      selection of adverse events for consideration. Two reviewers, working
      independently and in duplicate, screened the search results, extracted data and
      assessed risk of bias. We used random-effects models for all meta-analyses and
      the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to
      evaluate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: We identified 39 eligible studies
      that enrolled 12 143 adult patients with chronic pain. Very low certainty
      evidence suggests that adverse events are common (prevalence: 26.0%; 95% CI 13.2%
      to 41.2%) among users of medical cannabis for chronic pain, particularly any
      psychiatric adverse events (prevalence: 13.5%; 95% CI 2.6% to 30.6%). Very low
      certainty evidence, however, indicates serious adverse events, adverse events
      leading to discontinuation, cognitive adverse events, accidents and injuries, and
      dependence and withdrawal syndrome are less common and each typically occur in
      fewer than 1 in 20 patients. We compared studies with <24 weeks and >/=24 weeks
      of cannabis use and found more adverse events reported among studies with longer 
      follow-up (test for interaction p<0.01). Palmitoylethanolamide was usually
      associated with few to no adverse events. We found insufficient evidence
      addressing the harms of medical cannabis compared with other pain management
      options, such as opioids. CONCLUSIONS: There is very low certainty evidence that 
      adverse events are common among people living with chronic pain who use medical
      cannabis or cannabinoids, but that few patients experience serious adverse
      events.

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic and vitamin D: rising trends in status and in daily amounts of 
      vitamin D provided by supplements.
PG  - e059477
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059477 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there have been
      plausible suggestions about the need to augment vitamin D intake by
      supplementation in order to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection and reduce mortality.
      Some groups have advocated supplementation for all adults, but governmental
      agencies have advocated targeted supplementation. We sought to explore the effect
      of the COVID-19 pandemic on both vitamin D status and on the dose of
      new-to-market vitamin D supplements. SETTING: University hospital, Dublin,
      Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Laboratory-based samples of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin 
      D (25OHD) (n=100 505). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes: 
      comparing yearly average 25OHD prior to the pandemic (April 2019 to March 2020)
      with during the pandemic (April 2020 to March 2021) and comparing the dose of
      new-to-market vitamin D supplements between 2017 and 2021 (n=2689). SECONDARY
      OUTCOME: comparing prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D excess during
      the two time periods. RESULTS: The average yearly serum 25OHD measurement
      increased by 2.8 nmol/L (61.4, 95% CI 61.5 to 61.7 vs 58.6, 95% CI 58.4 to 58.9, 
      p<0.001), which was almost threefold higher than two similar trend analyses that 
      we conducted between 1993 and 2016. There was a lower prevalence of low 25OHD and
      a higher prevalence of high 25OHD. The dose of new-to-market vitamin D
      supplements was higher in the years 2020-2021 compared with the years 2017-2019
      (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We showed significant increases in serum 25OHD and in the
      dose of new-to-market vitamin D supplements. The frequency of low vitamin D
      status reduced indicating benefit, but the frequency of vitamin D excess
      increased indicating risk of harm. Rather than a blanket recommendation about
      vitamin D supplementation for all adults, we recommend a targeted approach of
      supplementation within current governmental guidelines to at-risk groups and
      cautioning consumers about adverse effects of high dose supplements on the
      market.

TI  - Impact of a standardised rapid response system on clinical outcomes of female
      patients: an interrupted time series approach.
LID - e001614 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the impact of a standardised rapid
      response systems (the Between the Flags (BTF)) implemented across New South Wales
      (NSW), Australia, among female patients. METHODS: We conducted an interrupted
      time series (2007-2013) population-based linkage study including 5 114 170 female
      patient (>/=18 years old) admissions in all 232 public hospitals in NSW. We
      studied changes in levels and trends of patient outcomes after BTF implementation
      among four age groups of female patients. RESULTS: Before the BTF system
      introduction (2007-2009), for the female patients as a whole, there was a
      progressive decrease in rates of in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (IHCA),
      IHCA-related mortality and hospital mortality for female patients. However, there
      were no changes in deaths in low-mortality diagnostic-related groups (DLMDRGs),
      IHCA survival to discharge and 1-year post-discharge mortality after surviving an
      IHCA. Only the female patients aged 55 years and older showed the same results as
      the whole sample. After the BTF programme (2010-2013), the same trends (except
      for DLMDRG) continued for female patients as a whole and for those aged 55 years 
      or older. There was a significant reduction in DLMDRG among female patients aged 
      35-54 years (p<0.001), those aged 75 years and over (p<0.05) and female patients 
      as a whole (p<0.05). The decreasing secular trend of surviving an IHCA to
      hospital discharge before the BTF system (p<0.05) among patients aged 18-34 years
      old was reversed after the BTF implementation (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: For female
      patients the BTF programme introduction was associated with continued reductions 
      in the rates of IHCA, IHCA-related mortality and hospital mortality, as well as a
      new reduction in DLMDRG for 35-54 years old patients and those aged 75 years and 
      older, and increased survival for those aged 18-34 years who had suffered an
      IHCA.

TI  - Electrocatalytic CO2-to-C2+ with Ampere-Level Current on Heteroatom-Engineered
      Copper via Tuning *CO Intermediate Coverage.
LID - 10.1021/jacs.2c06820 [doi]
AB  - An ampere-level current density of CO2 electrolysis is critical to realize the
      industrial production of multicarbon (C2+) fuels. However, under such a large
      current density, the poor CO intermediate (*CO) coverage on the catalyst surface 
      induces the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, which hinders CO2 reduction 
      reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we report reliable ampere-level CO2-to-C2+ electrolysis
      by heteroatom engineering on Cu catalysts. The Cu-based compounds with heteroatom
      (N, P, S, O) are electrochemically reduced to heteroatom-derived Cu with
      significant structural reconstruction under CO2RR conditions. It is found that
      N-engineered Cu (N-Cu) catalyst exhibits the best CO2-to-C2+ productivity with a 
      remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 73.7% under -1100 mA cm(-2) and an energy
      efficiency of 37.2% under -900 mA cm(-2). Particularly, it achieves a C2+ partial
      current density of -909 mA cm(-2) at -1.15 V versus reversible hydrogen
      electrode, which outperforms most reported Cu-based catalysts. In situ
      spectroscopy indicates that heteroatom engineering adjusts *CO adsorption on Cu
      surface and alters the local H proton consumption in solution. Density functional
      theory studies confirm that the high adsorption strength of *CO on N-Cu results
      from the depressed HER and promoted *CO adsorption on both bridge and atop sites 
      of Cu, which greatly reduces the energy barrier for C-C coupling.

TI  - Bioprosthesis in aortic valve replacement: long-term inflammatory response and
      functionality.
LID - e002065 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/openhrt-2022-002065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of long-term inflammatory response and function in
      postoperative patients with aortic valve replacement (AVR) deserves special
      analysis because it is important to try to prevent reoperation and improve
      durability and functionality of the prostheses. It is our objective METHODS: In
      this study, we included a cohort of patients with aortic valve damage treated by 
      AVR with mechanical prosthesis, bio prosthesis and we included a control group.
      RESULTS: We found that IL-4 and osteopontin levels were higher in patients with
      mechanical vs biological prostheses (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively),
      osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels were decreased (p=0.01), women had lower levels of
      ET-1 and IL-6, (p=0.02) (p=0.04), respectively. Patients older than 60 years had 
      decreased levels of IL-1ss p<0.001) and a higher concentration of IL-4 p<0.05).
      IL-1ss, OPG and TNFalpha were higher in patients with less than 5 years of
      evolution vs more than 10 years (p=0.004, p=0.02 and p=0.03, respectively).
      Factors such as age, gender, prosthetic and elevated IL-1B and ET-1 levels are
      associated with valve dysfunction prosthetic. These results indicate that the
      inflammatory involvement present prior to valve replacement may be perpetuated by
      various factors in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide us with the
      opportunity to effectively treat patients with AVR in the postoperative period,
      which could prolong the functionality of the bio prostheses. TRIAL REGISTRATION

AB  - The cell membrane capacitance (Cm) and characteristic frequencies (fc) of tissues
      can be obtained using segmental bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (S-BIS).
      Higher Cm and lower fc are associated with a larger surface area of skeletal
      muscle fibers with T-tubules in the tissues. Muscle fiber membrane is one of the 
      major physiological factors that influence surface electromyograms (EMGs) as well
      as the number of recruited motor units so that the amplitude of surface EMG may
      be correlated with Cm and fc. The aim of the current study was to examine the
      association of fc or Cm in the lower leg with contractile and neuromuscular
      properties in the plantar flexors. We analyzed data from 59 participants (29
      women) aged 21-83 years. The Cm, fc, and intracellular water (ICW) in the lower
      leg were obtained using S-BIS. We measured electrical-evoked torque, maximal
      voluntary contraction (MVC) torque, and amplitude of EMG normalized by the M wave
      during MVC contraction. The high Cm group had a significantly lower fc and
      significantly higher MVC torque, estimated maximum torque, twitch torque, and
      root mean square (RMS) of EMG normalized by the M wave (EMG:M) in the musculus
      triceps surae compared to the low Cm group (P < 0.05). Cm was positively and fc
      was negatively correlated with the nRMS of EMG:M in the triceps surae (P < 0.05).
      S-BIS recordings can be used to detect changes in skeletal muscle membrane
      capacitance, which may provide insights into the number of T-tubules. The muscle 
      capacitance measured with S-BIS can be predictive of muscle force generation.

TI  - Functional coupling of organic anion transporter OAT10 (SLC22A13) and
      monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 (SLC16A1) influencing the transport function of 
      OAT10.

AB  - OAT10 (SLC22A13) is a transporter highly expressed in renal tubules and
      transporting organic anions including nicotinate, beta-hydroxybutyrate,
      p-aminohippurate, and orotate. In transport assays using Xenopus oocytes and
      HEK293 cells, we found that apparent substrate selectivity of OAT10 was different
      between the expression systems, particularly less pronounced uptake of
      beta-hydroxybutyrate in HEK293 cells. Because functional coupling between
      transporters may interfere with functional properties of the transporter, we
      searched for endogenous transporters in HEK293 cells that could affect OAT10. By 
      means of comprehensive approach with co-immunoprecipitation followed by LC-MS/MS 
      analysis, we identified monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 (SLC16A1) as physically 
      coupled with OAT10. The knockdown of MCT1 in OAT10-expressing HEK293 cells
      increased the uptake of beta-hydroxybutyrate and nicotinate, common substrates of
      OAT10 and MCT1, whereas the uptake of orotate, a substrate of only OAT10, was not
      affected. MCT1 is supposed to act as an escape route and mediate the efflux of
      nicotinate and beta-hydroxybutyrate taken up by OAT10 localized nearby MCT1, as
      suggested by co-immunoprecipitation. This functional coupling would explain
      altered apparent substrate selectivity in HEK293 cells compared with Xenopus
      oocytes. The findings in this study warn in transporter studies that the
      expression system can interfere with assessing correct transport properties due
      to unexpected interactions with endogenous transporters.

AB  - Ceramide, a central molecule of sphingolipid metabolism, is phosphorylated to
      ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) by ceramide kinase (CerK). The CerK/C1P pathway
      regulates many cellular functions, but its roles in immune/inflammation-related
      (IIR) diseases in vivo are not well known. Sepsis is an acute systemic
      inflammatory disease accompanied by damage/dysfunction in multiple organs. In the
      present study, we investigated the effects of CerK knockout on the
      onset/progression of sepsis-related events in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated
      sepsis-model mice. In CerK-null mice, the lethality at 48 h after i.v. injection 
      of LPS was significantly increased compared with that in wild-type (WT) mice. The
      increased lethality by CerK knockout was reproduced in mice treated with i.p.
      injections of LPS. Changes in serum levels of 23 IIR molecules, including
      cytokines and chemokines, were measured. In WT mice, levels of these molecules
      increased 4 and/or 20 h after i.v. injection of LPS. Although the basal levels of
      IIR molecules were not affected, LPS-induced increases in interleukin-17 (IL-17),
      C-C motif chemokine ligands (CCL-2 and CCL-11), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      were significantly up-regulated, whereas IL-2 levels were slightly down-regulated
      by CerK knockout. Putative mechanisms for the CerK/C1P pathway-mediated
      regulation of IIR molecules and increased lethality in LPS-treated mice are
      discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment with a fluoropolymer-based drug-eluting stent (FP-DES has
      been widely applied to the contemporary femoropopliteal practice with durable
      outcomes. Nevertheless, the impact of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) utilization
      on clinical outcomes after FP-DES implantation has not been determined.
      OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the impact of IVUS on 1-year clinical
      outcomes after FP-DES) implantation for femoropopliteal lesions in patients with 
      symptomatic peripheral artery disease. METHODS: As a subanalysis of the CAPSICUM 
      (contemporary outcomes after paclitaxel-eluting peripheral stent implantation for
      symptomatic lower limb ischemia with superficial femoral or proximal popliteal
      lesion) study, the present investigation analyzed 1,091 patients with symptomatic
      peripheral artery disease who underwent endovascular therapy with FP-DES for
      femoropopliteal lesions. One-year clinical outcomes were compared between
      patients treated with IVUS and those treated without IVUS after propensity score 
      matching. The primary outcome measure was 1-year restenosis. The incidence of
      aneurysmal degeneration was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 843 (77.2%)
      patients underwent IVUS-guided FP-DES implantation. After propensity score
      matching, the 1-year restenosis was not significantly different between the
      groups (11.5% [95% CI: 9.1%-14.0%] vs 15.5% [95% CI: 10.9%-20.1%]; P = 0.22). The
      frequency of aneurysmal degeneration at 1 year was significantly higher in the
      IVUS group than in the non-IVUS group (19.8% [95% CI: 16.3%-23.4%] vs 7.1% [95%
      CI: 3.3%-11.0%]; P < 0.001). IVUS use was associated with a lower restenosis risk
      in patients with chronic total occlusion but not in those without (P for
      interaction = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that 1-year
      restenosis risk was not significantly different between the 2 groups, whereas the
      incidence of aneurysmal degeneration was significantly higher in the IVUS group.

TI  - Outcomes of Redo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement According to the Initial 
      and Subsequent Valve Type.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) replacement is increasingly used 
      in patients with longer life expectancy, a sizable proportion will require redo
      TAV replacement (TAVR). The unique configuration of balloon-expandable TAV (bTAV)
      vs a self-expanding TAV (sTAV) potentially affects TAV-in-TAV outcome.
      OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to better inform prosthesis selection, 
      TAV-in-TAV outcomes were assessed according to the type of initial and subsequent
      TAV. METHODS: Patients from the Redo-TAVR registry were analyzed using propensity
      weighting according to their initial valve type (bTAV [n = 115] vs sTAV [n =
      106]) and subsequent valve type (bTAV [n = 130] vs sTAV [n = 91]). RESULTS:
      Patients with failed bTAVs presented later (vs sTAV) (4.9 +/- 2.1 years vs 3.7
      +/- 2.3 years; P < 0.001), with smaller effective orifice area (1.0 +/- 0.7 cm(2)
      vs 1.3 +/- 0.8 cm(2); P = 0.018) and less frequent dominant regurgitation (16.2% 
      vs 47.3%; P < 0.001). Mortality at 30 days was 2.3% (TAV-in-bTAV) vs 0%
      (TAV-in-sTAV) (P = 0.499) and 1.7% (bTAV-in-TAV) vs 1.0% (sTAV-in-TAV) (P =
      0.612); procedural safety was 72.6% (TAV-in-bTAV) vs 71.2% (TAV-in-sTAV) (P =
      0.817) and 73.2% (bTAV-in-TAV) vs 76.5% (sTAV-in-TAV) (P = 0.590). Device success
      was similar according to initial valve type but higher with subsequent sTAV vs
      bTAV (77.2% vs 64.3%; P = 0.045), primarily because of lower residual gradients
      (10.3 mm Hg [8.9-11.7 mm Hg] vs 15.2 mm Hg [13.2-17.1 mm Hg]; P < 0.001).
      Residual regurgitation (moderate or greater) was similar after bTAV-in-TAV and
      sTAV-in-TAV (5.7%) and nominally higher after TAV-in-bTAV (9.1%) vs TAV-in-sTAV
      (4.4%) (P = 0.176). CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients, no association was
      observed between TAV type and redo TAVR safety or mortality, yet subsequent sTAV 
      was associated with higher device success because of lower redo gradients. These 
      findings are preliminary, and more data are needed to guide valve choice for redo
      TAVR.

      Valve-in-Valve Intervention With the ACURATE neo.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited evidence is available regarding valve-in-valve (VIV)
      intervention with the ACURATE neo transcatheter heart valve (THV). Low
      implantation has demonstrated leaflet interaction between the surgical
      bioprosthesis and the THV, leading to impaired hydrodynamic performance. It is
      unknown if commissural alignment (CA) can affect this phenomenon. Novel
      techniques have now been developed to achieve CA with the ACURATE neo THV.
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of commissural
      misalignment (CMA) on hydrodynamic function following VIV intervention with the
      ACURATE neo THV using a bench model. METHODS: VIV intervention was performed with
      the ACURATE neo (a self-expanding THV with supra-annular leaflet position)
      implanted deep in the surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve (Mitroflow).
      Hydrodynamic function at CA (0 degrees ) and 3 different degrees of CMA (30
      degrees , 60 degrees , and 90 degrees ) was tested. As per the International
      Organization for Standardization, a regurgitant fraction <20% is considered
      optimal. RESULTS: Following VIV, the central THV regurgitant fraction at 0
      degrees , 30 degrees , 60 degrees , and 90 degrees of CMA was 8.6% +/- 2.0%,
      30.3% +/- 12.0%, 42.6% +/- 11.9%, and 66.7% +/- 25.4% (P < 0.0001), respectively.
      On high-speed video there was no evidence of leaflet interaction at CA, whereas
      at 30 degrees , 60 degrees , and 90 degrees of CMA there was clear evidence of
      THV leaflet interaction with those of the surgical valve, leading to impaired
      leaflet closure and to severe central THV regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS: In VIV
      using the ACURATE neo THV at deep implantation, increasing degree of CMA was
      associated with THV leaflet interaction with those of the surgical valve and
      worsening regurgitant fraction. THV leaflet interaction was prevented when there 
      was CA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines for evaluating patients with suspected coronary artery
      disease (CAD) recommend pretest probability (PTP) estimation but provide no clear
      recommendations regarding diagnostic testing in patients with >5% to 15% risk of 
      obstructive CAD. The diagnostic and prognostic value of PROMISE (Prospective
      Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) minimal risk score (PMRS)
      calculation in this patient group is unknown. OBJECTIVES: This work aims to
      improve the evaluation of stable patients with suspected CAD by using the PMRS,
      which identifies patients at minimal risk of CAD and events in patients with >5% 
      to 15% PTP of obstructive CAD. METHODS: Greater than 5% to 15% PTP patients from 
      2 large clinical trials were used for subcohort derivation: PROMISE (N = 10,003) 
      and Dan-NICAD (Danish study of Non-Invasive Testing in Coronary Artery Disease)
      (N = 3,252). First, the PMRS cutoff associated with a prevalence of obstructive
      CAD </=5% was determined in the >5% to 15% PTP PROMISE core lab computed
      tomographic angiography patients (discovery cohort: n = 2,191). This cutoff was
      validated for obstructive CAD in >5% to 15% PTP Dan-NICAD patients (CAD
      validation cohort: n = 1,386) and for prognostic impact on death and myocardial
      infarction in >5% to 15% PTP PROMISE non-core lab computed tomographic
      angiography patients (prognosis validation cohort: n = 2,753). RESULTS: In the
      discovery cohort, a CAD prevalence of </=5% was found at a PMRS of >/=34%. In the
      CAD validation cohort, this cutoff down-classified 442 (31.9%) of >5% to 15% PTP 
      patients into the low PTP group (CAD </=5%); the prevalence of obstructive CAD in
      down-classified patients was 3.2% compared to 7.1% in non-down-classified
      patients. A PMRS >/=34% was nonsignificantly associated with a lower risk of
      myocardial infarction and death in the prognosis validation cohort (HR: 0.58 [95%
      CI: 0.29-1.18]; P = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: For evaluating patients with suspected
      CAD, a combined use of traditional PTP and the PMRS correctly down-classified
      one-third of >5% to 15% PTP patients into a group with very low prevalence of
      obstructive CAD and adverse events. The proposed strategy may improve risk
      stratification and help reduce unneeded diagnostic testing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased inflammation and myocardial injury can be observed in the
      absence of myocardial infarction or obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).
      OBJECTIVES: The authors determined whether biomarkers of inflammation and
      myocardial injury-interleukin (IL)-6 and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin
      (hs-cTn)-were associated with the presence and extent of CAD and were independent
      predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in stable chest pain.
      METHODS: Using participants from the PROMISE trial, the authors measured hs-cTn I
      and IL-6 concentrations and analyzed computed tomography angiography (CTA) images
      in the core laboratory for CAD characteristics: significant stenosis (>/=70%),
      high-risk plaque (HRP), Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System
      (CAD-RADS) categories, segment involvement score (SIS), and coronary artery
      calcium (CAC) score. The primary endpoint was a composite MACE (death, myocardial
      infarction, or unstable angina). RESULTS: The authors included 1,796 participants
      (age 60.2 +/- 8.0 years; 47.5% men, median follow-up 25 months). In multivariable
      linear regression adjusted for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
      risk, hs-cTn was associated with HRP, stenosis, CAD-RADS, and SIS. IL-6 was only 
      associated with stenosis and CAD-RADS. hs-cTn above median (1.5 ng/L) was
      associated with MACEs in univariable analysis (HR: 2.1 [95% CI: 1.3-3.6]; P =
      0.006), but not in multivariable analysis adjusted for ASCVD and CAD. IL-6 above 
      median (1.8 ng/L) was associated with MACEs in multivariable analysis adjusted
      for ASCVD and HRP (HR: 1.9 [95% CI: 1.1-3.3]; P = 0.03), CAC (HR: 1.9 [95% CI:
      1.0-3.4]; P = 0.04), and SIS (HR: 1.8 [95% CI: 1.0-3.2]; P = 0.04), but not for
      stenosis or CAD-RADS. In participants with nonobstructive CAD (stenosis 1%-69%), 
      the presence of both hs-cTn and IL-6 above median was strongly associated with
      MACEs (HR: 2.5-2.7 after adjustment for CAD characteristics). CONCLUSIONS:
      Concentrations of hs-cTn and IL-6 were associated with CAD characteristics and
      MACEs, indicating that myocardial injury and inflammation may each contribute to 
      pathways in CAD pathophysiology. This association was most pronounced among
      participants with nonobstructive CAD representing an opportunity to tailor
      treatment in this at-risk group. (PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for
      Evaluation of Chest Pain [PROMISE]; NCT01174550).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noninvasive functional imaging is often performed in patients with
      obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) on coronary computed tomography
      angiography (CTA). However, the prognostic value of stress cardiac magnetic
      resonance (CMR) is unknown in patients with coronary stenosis of unknown
      significance on coronary CTA. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the prognostic
      value of stress CMR in symptomatic patients with obstructive CAD of unknown
      significance on coronary CTA. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2020, consecutive
      symptomatic patients without known CAD referred for coronary CTA were screened.
      Patients with obstructive CAD (at least 1 >/=50% stenosis on coronary CTA) were
      further referred for stress CMR and followed for the occurrence of major adverse 
      cardiovascular events (MACEs), defined as cardiovascular death or nonfatal
      myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Of 2,210 patients who completed CMR, 2,038 (46.5%
      men; mean age 69.8 +/- 12.2 years) completed follow-up (median 6.8 years; IQR:
      5.9-9.2 years); 281 experienced a MACE (13.8%). Inducible ischemia and late
      gadolinium enhancement (LGE) were significantly associated with MACEs (HR: 4.51
      [95% CI: 3.55-5.74], and HR: 3.32 [95% CI: 2.55-4.32], respectively; P < 0.001). 
      In multivariable Cox regression, the number of segments with >70% stenosis, with 
      noncalcified plaques and the number of vessels with obstructive CAD were
      prognosticators (P < 0.001). The presence of inducible ischemia and LGE were
      independent predictors of MACEs (HR: 3.97 [95% CI: 3.43-5.13]; HR: 2.30 [95% CI: 
      1.52-3.33]; P < 0.001). After adjustment, stress CMR showed the best improvement 
      in model discrimination and reclassification above traditional risk factors and
      coronary CTA (C-statistic improvement: 0.04; net reclassification improvement =
      0.421; integrative discrimination index = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic
      patients with obstructive CAD of unknown significance on coronary CTA, stress CMR
      had incremental prognostic value to predict MACEs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines distinguish stage B heart failure (SBHF)
      (asymptomatic left ventricular [LV] dysfunction) from stage A heart failure
      (SAHF) (asymptomatic with heart failure [HF] risk factors) on the basis of
      myocardial infarction, LV remodeling (hypertrophy or reduced ejection fraction
      [EF]) or valvular disease. However, subclinical HF with preserved EF may not be
      identified with these criteria. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to
      assess the prediction of incident HF with global longitudinal strain (GLS) in
      patients with SAHF and SBHF. METHODS: The authors analyzed echocardiograms
      (including GLS) in 447 patients (age 65 +/- 11 years; 77% male) enrolled in a
      prospective study of HF in individuals at risk of incident HF, with normal or
      mildly impaired EF (>/=40%). Long-term follow-up was obtained via data linkage.
      Analysis was performed using a competing risks model. RESULTS: After a median of 
      9 years of follow-up, 50 (10%) of the 447 patients had new HF admissions, and 87 
      (18%) died. In multivariable analysis, all imaging variables were independent
      predictors of HF admissions, including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
      (HR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.94-0.99]), LV mass index (HR: 1.01 [95% CI: 1.00-1.02]),
      left atrial volume index (HR: 1.02 [95% CI: 1.00-1.05]), and E/e' (HR: 1.05 [95% 
      CI: 1.01-1.24]), incremental to clinical variables (age and Charlson comorbidity 
      score). However, the addition of GLS provided value incremental to both clinical 
      and other echocardiographic parameters (P = 0.004). Impaired GLS (<18%) (HR: 4.09
      [95% CI: 1.87-8.92]) was independent and incremental to all clinical and other
      echocardiographic variables in predicting HF, and impaired LVEF, left ventricular
      hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, high E/e', or SBHF were not predictive.
      CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of GLS as a criterion for SBHF would add independent
      and incremental information to standard markers of SBHF for the prediction of
      subsequent HF admissions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Echocardiographic global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a useful
      measure for detection of cancer treatment-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) but
      is influenced by blood pressure changes. This limitation may be overcome by
      assessment of myocardial work (MW), which incorporates blood pressure into the
      calculation. OBJECTIVES: This work aims to determine whether myocardial work
      indices (MWIs) can help diagnose or prognosticate CTRCD. METHODS: In this
      prospective cohort study, 136 women undergoing anthracycline and trastuzumab
      treatment for HER2+ breast cancer, underwent serial echocardiograms and cardiac
      magnetic resonance pre- and post-anthracycline and every 3 months during
      trastuzumab. GLS, global work index (GWI), global constructive work (GCW), global
      wasted work, and global work efficiency were measured. CTRCD was defined with
      cardiac magnetic resonance. Generalized estimating equations quantified the
      association between changes in GLS and MWIs and CTRCD at the current (diagnosis) 
      and subsequent visit (prognosis). Regression tree analysis was used to explore
      the combined use of GLS and MW for the diagnostic/prognostic assessment of CTRCD.
      RESULTS: Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 63.2 +/- 4.0%.
      Thirty-seven (27.2%) patients developed CTRCD. An absolute change in GLS
      (standardized odds ratio [sOR]: 1.97 [95% CI: 1.07-3.66]; P = 0.031) and GWI
      (sOR: 1.73 [95% CI: 1.04-2.85]; P = 0.033) were associated with concurrent CTRCD.
      An absolute change in GLS (sOR: 1.79 [95% CI: 1.22-2.62]; P = 0.003), GWI (sOR:
      1.67 [95% CI: 1.20-2.32]; P = 0.003), and GCW (sOR: 1.65 [95% CI: 1.17-2.34]; P =
      0.005) were associated with subsequent CTRCD. Change in GWI and GCW demonstrated 
      incremental value over GLS and clinical factors for the diagnosis of concurrent
      CTRCD. In a small group with a GLS change <3.3% (absolute), and a >21 mm Hg
      reduction in systolic blood pressure, worsening of GWI identified patients with
      higher probability of concurrent CTRCD (24.0% vs 5.2%). MWIs did not improve
      identification of subsequent CTRCD beyond knowledge of GLS change. CONCLUSIONS:
      GLS can be used to diagnose and prognosticate cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
      defined CTRCD, with additional value from MWIs in selected cases. (Evaluation of

TI  - Diagnostic Errors in Cerebrovascular Pathology: Retrospective Analysis of a
      Neuroradiology Database at a Large Tertiary Academic Medical Center.
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A7596 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diagnostic errors affect 2%-8% of neuroradiology studies,
      resulting in significant potential morbidity and mortality. This retrospective
      analysis of a large database at a single tertiary academic institution focuses on
      diagnostic misses in cerebrovascular pathology and suggests error-reduction
      strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT and MR imaging reports from a consecutive
      database spanning 2015-2020 were searched for errors of attending physicians in
      cerebrovascular pathology. Data were collected on missed findings, study types,
      and interpretation settings. Errors were categorized as ischemic, arterial,
      venous, hemorrhagic, and "other." RESULTS: A total of 245,762 CT and MR imaging
      neuroradiology examinations were interpreted during the study period. Vascular
      diagnostic errors were present in 165 reports, with a mean of 49.6 (SD, 23.3)
      studies on the shifts when an error was made, compared with 34.9 (SD, 19.2) on
      shifts without detected errors (P < .0001). Seventy percent of examinations
      occurred in the hospital setting; 93.3% of errors were perceptual; 6.7% were
      interpretive; and 93.9% (n = 155) were clinically significant (RADPEER 2B or 3B).
      The distribution of errors was arterial and ischemic each with 33.3%, hemorrhagic
      with 21.8%, and venous with 7.5%. Most errors involved brain MR imaging (30.3%)
      followed by head CTA (27.9%) and noncontrast head CT (26.1%). The most common
      misses were acute/subacute infarcts (25.1%), followed by aneurysms (13.7%) and
      subdural hematomas (9.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Most cerebrovascular diagnostic errors
      were perceptual and clinically significant, occurred in the emergency/inpatient
      setting, and were associated with higher-volume shifts. Diagnostic errors could
      be minimized by adjusting search patterns to ensure vigilance on the sites of the
      frequently missed pathologies.

TI  - Flow Diversion in the Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms: A Pragmatic Randomized
      Care Trial.
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A7597 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow diversion is a recent endovascular treatment for
      intracranial aneurysms. We compared the safety and efficacy of flow diversion
      with the alternative standard management options. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      parallel group, prerandomized, controlled, open-label pragmatic trial was
      conducted in 3 Canadian centers. The trial included all patients considered for
      flow diversion. A Web-based platform 1:1 randomly allocated patients to flow
      diversion or 1 of 4 alternative standard management options (coiling with/without
      stent placement, parent vessel occlusion, surgical clipping, or observation) as
      prespecified by clinical judgment. Patients ineligible for alternative standard
      management options were treated with flow diversion in a registry. The primary
      safety outcome was death or dependency (mRS > 2) at 3 months. The composite
      primary efficacy outcome included the core lab-determined angiographic presence
      of a residual aneurysm, aneurysm rupture, progressive mass effect during
      follow-up, or death or dependency (mRS > 2) at 3-12 months. RESULTS: Between May 
      2011 and November 2020, three hundred twenty-three patients were recruited: Two
      hundred seventy-eight patients (86%) had treatment randomly allocated (139 to
      flow diversion and 139 to alternative standard management options), and 45 (14%) 
      received flow diversion in the registry. Patients in the randomized trial
      frequently had unruptured (83%), large (52% >/=10 mm) carotid (64%) aneurysms.
      Death or dependency at 3 months occurred in 16/138 patients who underwent flow
      diversion and 12/137 patients receiving alternative standard management options
      (relative risk, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.65-2.69; P = .439). A poor primary efficacy
      outcome was found in 30.9% (43/139) with flow diversion and 45.6% (62/136) of
      patients receiving alternative standard management options, with an absolute risk
      difference of 14.7% (95% CI, 3.3%-26.0%; relative risk, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50-0.92; 
      P = .014). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with mostly unruptured, large, anterior
      circulation (carotid) aneurysms, flow diversion was more effective than the
      alternative standard management option in terms of angiographic outcome.

TI  - Comparing 1-year and 10-year whole blood metal ion results following Birmingham
      hip resurfacing for osteoarthritis.
PG  - E504-E511
LID - 10.1503/cjs.012921 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty may develop adverse
      reactions to metal debris that can lead to clinically concerning symptoms, often 
      needing revision surgery. As such, many regulatory authorities advocate for
      routine blood metal ion measurement. This study compares whole blood metal ion
      levels obtained 1 year following Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) to levels
      obtained at a minimum 10-year follow-up. METHODS: A retrospective chart review
      was conducted to identify all patients who underwent a BHR for osteoarthritis
      with a minimum 10-year follow-up. Whole blood metal ion levels were obtained at
      final follow-up in June 2019. These results were compared with patients' metal
      ion levels at 1 year. RESULTS: Of the 211 patients who received a BHR, 71
      patients (54 males and 17 females) had long-term metal ion levels assessed (mean 
      follow-up 12.7 +/- 1.4 yr). The mean cobalt and chromium levels for patients with
      unilateral BHRs (43 males and 13 females) were 3.12 +/- 6.31 mug/L and 2.62 +/-
      2.69 mug/L, respectively; for patients with bilateral BHRs (11 males and 4
      females) cobalt and chromium levels were 2.78 +/- 1.02 mug/L and 1.83 +/- 0.65
      mug/L, respectively. Thirty-five patients (27 male and 8 female) had metal ion
      levels tested at 1 year postoperatively. The mean changes in cobalt and chromium 
      levels were 2.29 mug/L (p = 0.0919) and 0.57 mug/L (p = 0.1612), respectively.
      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that regular metal ion testing as per current
      regulatory agency guidelines may be impractical for asymptomatic patients. Metal 
      ion levels may in fact have little utility in determining the risk of failure and
      should be paired with radiographic and clinical findings to determine the need
      for revision.

TI  - Femoral stem migration after direct lateral and direct anterior total hip
      arthroplasty: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - E487-E495
LID - 10.1503/cjs.013221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The direct lateral (DL) approach to total hip arthroplasty is more
      commonly used than the newer direct anterior (DA) approach. Both approaches use
      collared or collarless femoral stems. We sought to assess implant stability of
      stem designs implanted with the DL approach and compare outcomes from this cohort
      with those of a previously reported cohort of patients who underwent arthroplasty
      with a DA approach. We also sought to determine if early recovery influences
      differences in migration. METHODS: Patients underwent total hip arthroplasty
      using the DL or the DA approach and were randomized to receive either a collared 
      or collarless, cementless femoral stem. On the day of surgery and at 6 follow-up 
      visits through to 1 year, patients underwent supine radiostereometric imaging to 
      track implant migration. At follow-up visits, patients performed an instrumented 
      walking test to assess their functional ability and logged an average daily step 
      count to assess their activity levels. We assessed whether patient function and
      activity were correlated with migration. RESULTS: Stem design did not have a
      significant effect on migration for the DL group (p = 0.894). Compared with the
      DA group, the DL group migrated significantly less for both collared (p = 0.031) 
      and collarless (p = 0.002) stems. Migration was not correlated with function or
      activity at any time point (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Most implant migration
      occurred from the day of surgery to 2 weeks after the operation and stabilized
      thereafter, suggesting adequate fixation and a low risk for aseptic loosening in 
      both patient groups.

TI  - Evaluating Guideline Directed Medical Therapy in Patients With Heart Failure With

PG  - 8971900221118172
LID - 10.1177/08971900221118172 [doi]
AB  - Background: Limited evidence regarding the use of guideline directed medical
      therapy (GDMT) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
      (HFrEF) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is available.
      Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize prescription of HFrEF
      GDMT use before and after CABG. Methods: A retrospective analysis of adult
      patients with an ejection fraction </=40% undergoing CABG was performed. The
      primary objective was to evaluate patients receiving HFrEF GDMT, defined as a
      heart failure beta-blocker (HFBB) and a renin-angiotensin inhibitor
      preoperatively and postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included dosing, percent
      of patients on each individual therapy, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist
      (MRA) use, and the combination thereof. The follow up period was 1 year. Results:
      Thirty-eight patients met criteria for inclusion. Prior to CABG, 52.6% of
      patients were receiving HFrEF GDMT. The prescribing rate of HFrEF GDMT was not
      significantly higher at any point within 1 year postoperatively (P = .299). The
      rate of renin-angiotensin inhibitors, HFBB, and aldosterone antagonists use
      significantly increased from 13.2% preoperatively to 36.8% at 1 year after CABG
      (P = .022). Doses of individual therapies were not significantly different across
      all time points preoperatively and postoperatively. Conclusion: HFrEF GDMT use
      and doses of individual therapies after CABG were not maximized. Collaborative
      efforts between cardiac surgeons, heart failure cardiologists, and pharmacists
      could be used to optimize HFrEF GDMT use and dose titration.

TI  - Quadriceps Function and Athletic Performance in Highly Trained Female Athletes.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1123/jsr.2021-0359 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Quadriceps strength is considered a key contributor to performance in
      various athletic tasks. Yet, past research has reported conflicting results based
      on population, with little data available in highly trained female athletes.
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHOD: To examine how athletic performance relates to
      quadriceps strength and neural function, we measured the quadriceps maximum
      voluntary isometric contraction force (MVIC) and rate of force development over 0
      to 50 ms (rate of force development [RFD]0-50ms), and various performance
      measures in 34 highly trained female athletes. RESULTS: Stepwise multiple
      regression analysis revealed that the quadriceps variables explained 16 of 21
      performance variables (R2 = .08-.36, P </= .10). Squat performance related to
      RFD0-50ms alone (R2 = .17-.20, P < .05; betaRFD = 0.41 to 0.45, P < .05) but only
      MVIC explained the variance in sprinting and vertical jump performance (R2 =
      .08-.34, P </= .10; betaMVIC = -0.51 to 0.58, P </= .10). The broad jump model
      included both parameters and their interaction (R2 = .20, P = .08; betaRFD =
      0.06, P = .76; betaMVIC = -0.39, P = .03; betaRFDxMVIC = -0.24, P = .10).
      CONCLUSION: The contribution of the quadriceps MVIC or RFD0-50ms varies in size
      and nature depending on the task or leg dominance. While quadriceps are
      significant contributors to performance, because our models leave most of the
      variance in performance unexplained, rehabilitation and performance professionals
      should refrain from interpreting peak athletic performance as a reflection of
      knee-extensors function in highly trained female athletes.

LID - 10.1123/jsr.2022-0014 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Ankle sprains are common during sport participation and associated with 
      long-term deficits in self-report of function. However, little is known of
      short-term changes in self-report of function following injury. The authors aimed
      to assess statistical and clinically meaningful changes in self-report of
      function, as measured by the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), during the
      first 2 weeks after an ankle sprain injury. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of
      electronic medical records. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients, who were diagnosed
      with an ankle sprain injury by an athletic trainer, received usual care from an
      athletic trainer, and completed the FAAM during treatment at weeks 1 and 2
      postinjury. The authors calculated the percentage of patients who reported
      clinically meaningful changes and used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare
      differences in FAAM scores between time points. RESULTS: Between weeks 1 and 2,
      significant differences were noted for the FAAM Activities of Daily Living
      (FAAM-ADL) (P < .001) and FAAM Sport (FAAM-Sport) (P < .001). At the patient
      level, 86.5% (64/74) and 85.2% (69/81) of patients reported changes that exceeded
      the minimal clinically important difference value for the FAAM-ADL and
      FAAM-Sport, respectively, between weeks 1 and 2. At week 2, 31.8% (28/88) and
      47.7% (42/88) of patients reported a score below 90% on the FAAM-ADL and below
      80% on the FAAM-Sport subscale, respectively. Also, 36.4% (32/88) and 25.0%
      (22/88) of patients reported a score of 100% on the FAAM-ADL and FAAM-Sport
      subscales, respectively, at week 2. CONCLUSIONS: Patients report statistically
      significant and meaningful improvements in self-report of function during the
      first 2 weeks following ankle sprain injury. However, almost half of patients
      still report deficits in sport function at 2 weeks postinjury. Patient-reported
      outcome measures such as the FAAM, can help capture the patient's perception of
      function and inform patient care decisions. Research efforts should explore
      individual response patterns to treatment.

TI  - Association Between Knee Extension Strength at 3 and 6 Months After Anterior
      Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1123/jsr.2021-0336 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Deficits in knee extension strength after anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction have been a major problem. The inadequate recovery of the knee
      extension strength of surgical limb reportedly delays return to sports and
      increases reinjury risk. Accordingly, the early detection of knee extension
      strength deficits after reconstruction may help plan early interventions to
      manage impairment. This study aimed to clarify the association between knee
      extension strength at 3 and 6 months after anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction. DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: Fifty patients who
      underwent primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using hamstring
      grafts were included. At 3 months postoperatively, the limb symmetry index (LSI) 
      of isokinetic knee extension strength (IKE) at 60 degrees /s, degree of swelling,
      passive range of motion of knee flexion and extension, and anterior leg reach
      distance were measured. At 6 months postoperatively, the LSI of IKE was measured 
      at 60 degrees /s, which was used as the main outcome. A correlation analysis was 
      performed with the LSI of IKE at 6 months postoperatively as the dependent
      variable and the LSI of IKE at 3 months postoperatively as the independent
      variable. Subsequently, a multiple regression analysis was performed, with LSI of
      IKE at 6 months postoperatively as the dependent variable; LSI of IKE at 3 months
      postoperatively as the independent variable; and other variables, demographic
      information, and surgical data as covariates. RESULTS: The correlation analysis
      revealed that the LSIs of IKE at 3 and 6 months postoperatively were correlated
      (r = .535, P < .001). In the multiple regression analysis, the LSI of IKE at 3
      months postoperatively was significantly associated with that at 6 months
      postoperatively, even when other variables were included as covariates (R2 =
      .349, P = .004). CONCLUSION: Asymmetry of knee extension strength at 3 months
      postoperatively could be more useful than other variables related to knee
      strength in predicting the asymmetry of knee extension strength at 6 months
      postoperatively.

TI  - Adding Vibration During Varied-Intensity Work Intervals Increases Time Spent Near
      Maximal Oxygen Uptake in Well-Trained Cyclists.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1123/ijspp.2021-0572 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Previous research suggests that the percentage of maximal oxygen uptake 
      attained and the time it is sustained close to maximal oxygen uptake (eg, >90%)
      can serve as a good criterion to judge the effectiveness of a training stimulus. 
      The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects of adding vibration
      during varied high-intensity interval training (HIIT) sessions on physiological
      and neuromuscular responses. METHODS: Twelve well-trained cyclists completed a
      counterbalanced crossover protocol, wherein 2 identical varied HIIT cycling
      sessions were performed with and without intermittent vibration to the
      lower-intensity workloads of the work intervals (6 x 5-min work intervals and
      2.5-min active recovery). Each 5-minute work interval consisted of 3 blocks of 40
      seconds performed at 100% of maximal aerobic power interspersed with 60-second
      workload performed at a lower power output, equal to the lactate threshold plus
      20% of the difference between lactate threshold and maximal aerobic power. Oxygen
      uptake and electromyographic activity of lower and upper limbs were recorded
      during all 5-minute work intervals. RESULTS: Adding vibration induced a longer
      time >/=90% maximal oxygen uptake (11.14 [7.63] vs 8.82 [6.90] min, d = 0.64, P =
      .048) and an increase in electromyographic activity of lower and upper limbs
      during the lower-intensity workloads by 20% (16%) and 34% (43%) (d = 1.09 and
      0.83; P = .03 and .015), respectively. CONCLUSION: Adding vibration during a
      varied HIIT session increases the physiological demand of the cardiovascular and 
      neuromuscular systems, indicating that this approach can be used to optimize the 
      training stimulus of well-trained cyclists.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 on Well-Being and Physical Activity in Ugandan Children With
      and Without HIV.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1123/jpah.2022-0061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aims to understand the socioeconomic and physical
      activity impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children living with perinatally
      acquired HIV (PHIV) and without HIV (HIV-) in Kampala (Uganda). METHODS: The
      authors included children aged 10-18 years who filled out questionnaires at
      baseline (2017-2018, prepandemic) and 2 years later (March 2020-January 2021,
      pandemic) in an observational cohort study at Joint Clinical Research Centre
      (Kampala). Physical activity energy expenditure was calculated using a youth
      compendium from the National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research.
      Descriptive and standard test statistics including Kruskal-Wallis were used.
      RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-eight children from Kampala Uganda were included 
      prepandemic (101 PHIV and 97 HIV-); 131 (71 PHIV and 60 HIV-) had information
      collected during the pandemic. At baseline, median and interquartile range age
      was 13 years (11; 15), and 52% were females. During the pandemic, overall weekly 
      physical activity increased by a median of 854 minutes (interquartile range:
      270-1890), and energy expenditures increased by 16% in both PHIV and in HIV- (P <
      .001 for groups overall prepandemic vs pandemic). CONCLUSIONS: The authors found 
      in this Ugandan cohort of children that children engaged in more physical
      activity. Further research is warranted to understand the long-term effects of
      the pandemic on children's well-being.

TI  - Clinical Impact of a Quality Improvement Program Including Dedicated Emergency
      Radiology Personnel on Emergency Surgical Management: A Propensity Score-Matching
      Study.
LID - 10.3348/kjr.2022.0278 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical impact of a quality improvement program
      including dedicated emergency radiology personnel (QIP-DERP) on the management of
      emergency surgical patients in the emergency department (ED). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: This retrospective study identified all adult patients (n = 3667) who
      underwent preoperative body CT, for which written radiology reports were
      generated, and who subsequently underwent non-elective surgery between 2007 and
      2018 in the ED of a single urban academic tertiary medical institution. The study
      cohort was divided into periods before and after the initiation of QIP-DERP. We
      matched the control group patients (i.e., before QIP-DERP) to the QIP-DERP group 
      patients using propensity score (PS), with a 1:2 matching ratio for the main
      analysis and a 1:1 ratio for sub-analyses separately for daytime (8:00 AM to 5:00
      PM on weekdays) and after-hours. The primary outcome was timing of emergency
      surgery (TES), which was defined as the time from ED arrival to surgical
      intervention. The secondary outcomes included ED length of stay (LOS) and
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate. RESULTS: According to the PS-matched
      analysis, compared with the control group, QIP-DERP significantly decreased the
      median TES from 16.7 hours (interquartile range, 9.4-27.5 hours) to 11.6 hours
      (6.6-21.9 hours) (p < 0.001) and the ICU admission rate from 33.3% (205/616) to
      23.9% (295/1232) (p < 0.001). During after-hours, the QIP-DERP significantly
      reduced median TES from 19.9 hours (12.5-30.1 hours) to 9.6 hours (5.7-19.1
      hours) (p < 0.001), median ED LOS from 9.1 hours (5.6-16.5 hours) to 6.7 hours
      (4.9-11.3 hours) (p < 0.001), and ICU admission rate from 35.5% (108/304) to
      22.0% (67/304) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: QIP-DERP implementation improved the
      quality of emergency surgical management in the ED by reducing TES, ED LOS, and
      ICU admission rate, particularly during after-hours.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of the Safe Triangular Working Zone Approach in Percutaneous 
      Vertebroplasty for Spinal Metastasis.
LID - 10.3348/kjr.2021.0914 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the technical feasibility, efficacy, and
      safety of the safe triangular working zone (STWZ) approach applied in
      percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) for spinal metastases involving the posterior
      part of the vertebral body. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 87
      patients who underwent PV for spinal metastasis involving the posterior part of
      the vertebral body, with or without the STWZ approach, from January 2019 to April
      2022. Forty-nine patients (27 females and 22 males; mean age +/- standard
      deviation [SD], 57.2 +/- 11.6 years; age range, 31-76 years) were included in
      group A (with STWZ approach), accounting for 54 vertebrae. Thirty-eight patients 
      (18 females and 20 males; 59.1 +/- 10.9 years; 29-81 years) were included in
      group B (without STWZ approach), accounting for 57 vertebrae. Patient
      demographics, procedure-related variables, and pain relief as assessed using the 
      visual analog scale (VAS) were collected at different time points. Tumor
      recurrence in the vertebrae after PV was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves.
      RESULTS: The STWZ approach was successful from T1 to L5 without severe
      complications. Cement filling was satisfactory in 47/54 (87.0%) and 25/57 (43.9%)
      vertebrae in groups A and B, respectively (p < 0.001). Cement leakage was not
      significantly different between groups A and B (p = 1.000). Mean VAS score +/- SD
      before and 1 week and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after PV were 7.6 +/- 1.8, 4.2
      +/- 2.0, 2.7 +/- 1.9, 1.9 +/- 1.5, 1.7 +/- 1.4, 1.7 +/- 1.1, and 1.6 +/- 1.3,
      respectively, in group A and 7.2 +/- 1.7, 4.0 +/- 1.3, 3.4 +/- 1.6, 2.4 +/- 1.2, 
      1.8 +/- 1.0, 1.4 +/- 0.5, and 1.7 +/- 0.9, respectively, in group B. Kaplan-Meier
      analysis showed a lower tumor recurrence rate in group A than in group B (p =
      0.001). CONCLUSION: The STWZ approach may represent a new, safe,
      alternative/auxiliary approach to target the posterior part of the vertebral body
      in the PV for spinal metastases.

TI  - Clinical and Microbiological effects in High-risk Beef Calves Administered
      Intranasal or Parenteral Modified-live Virus Vaccines.
LID - skac249 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jas/skac249 [doi]
AB  - Experimental bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infection can enhance
      Histophilus somni (Hs) disease in calves; we thus hypothesized that modified-live
      virus (MLV) vaccines containing BRSV may alter Hs carriage. Our objective was to 
      determine effects of an intranasal (IN) trivalent (infectious bovine
      rhinotracheitis virus [IBRV], parainfluenza-3 virus [PI3V], and BRSV) respiratory
      vaccine with parenteral (PT) bivalent bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type I +
      II vaccine, or a PT pentavalent (BVDV type I and II, IBRV, BRSV, and PI3V)
      respiratory vaccine, on health, growth, immunity, and nasal pathogen colonization
      in high-risk beef calves. Calves (n=525) were received in 5 truckload blocks and 
      stratified by body weight (213+/-18.4 kg), sex, and presence of a pre-existing
      ear-tag. Pens were spatially arranged in sets of 3 within block and randomly
      assigned to treatment with an empty pen between treatment groups consisting of:
      1) no MLV respiratory vaccination (CON), 2) IN trivalent MLV respiratory vaccine 
      with PT BVDV type I + II vaccine (INT), or 3) PT pentavalent, MLV respiratory
      vaccine (INJ). Pen was the experimental unit, with 15 pens/treatment and 11 - 12 
      calves/pen in this 70-d receiving study. Health, performance, and BRSV, Hs,
      Mycoplasma bovis (Mb), Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh), and Pasteurella multocida
      (Pm) level in nasal swabs via rtPCR was determined on d 0, 7, 14, and 28, and
      BRSV-specific serum neutralizing antibody titer, and serum IFN-gamma
      concentration via ELISA, were evaluated on d 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70. Morbidity
      (P=0.83), mortality (P=0.68) and average daily gain (P>/=0.82) did not differ.
      Serum antibody against BRSV increased with time (P<0.01). There was a treatment x
      time interaction (P<0.01) for Hs detection; on d 14 and 28, INT (21.1 and 57.1%) 
      were more frequently (P<0.01) Hs positive than CON (3.6 and 25.3%) or INJ (3.4
      and 8.4%). Also, INT had reduced (P=0.03) cycle time of Hs positive samples on d 
      28. No difference (P>/=0.17) was found for IFN-gamma concentration and Mb, Mh, or
      Pm detection. The proportion of Mh positive culture from lung specimens differed 
      (P<0.01); INT had fewer (0.0%; 0 of 9) Mh positive lungs than INJ (45.5%; 6 of
      13) or CON (74.0%; 14 of 19). Vaccination of high-risk calves with MLV did not
      clearly impact health or growth during the receiving period. However, INT was
      associated with altered upper respiratory microbial community in cattle resulting
      in increased detection and level of Hs.

TI  - Can Subcoracoid Effusion be a More Specific Finding for Subscapularis Tear Among 
      Rotator Cuff Pathologies on Magnetic Resonance Imaging?
LID - S1058-2746(22)00573-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2022.06.009 [doi]
AB  - HYPOTHESIS AND BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-known,
      non-invasive diagnostic method for rotator cuff tendon pathologies that are not
      very sensitive for subscapularis tendon tears. Subcoracoid effusion (SE) is an
      easily recognizable radiological sign on MRI. In this study, we aimed to examine 
      the relationship of SE with rotator cuff tear and to investigate whether SE could
      be a supportive finding in the diagnosis of subscapularis tear in preoperative
      MRI. Our hypothesis was that subcoracoid effusion was a more specific finding of 
      subscapularis tear than other rotator cuff tears. METHODS: The data of patients
      who underwent shoulder arthroscopy in our clinic between 2017 and 2021 were
      analyzed retrospectively. Four groups were included in the study: patients with a
      rotator cuff tear accompanied by a subscapularis tear (group 1, n=273), patients 
      with isolated subscapularis tear (group 2, n=57), patients with rotator cuff tear
      with intact subscapularis tendon (group 3, n=190), and patients without any
      rotator cuff pathology (group 4, n=263). Arthroscopic video records and MRIs of
      all patients were evaluated retrospectively. Subscapularis tendon tears were
      classified according to the Lafosse classification. RESULTS: There was a
      statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of the presence 
      of SE on MRI. (P=0.001) The presence of subcoracoid effusion in Group 1 and Group
      2 was statistically significantly higher than both Group 3 and Group 4 (p =
      0.001) and there was no significant difference between Group 3 and Group 4 (p >
      0.05). A significant relationship was found between Lafosse classification and SE
      (P=0.001). When the diagnostic powers of the detection of SSC tear and the
      presence of SE on MRI for SSC tear were compared, Kappa values were 0.615
      (p=0.001) and 0.701 (p=001), and overall diagnostic accuracy rates were 80.3% and
      85.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: We conclude that subcoracoid effusion is a more 
      specific finding for supscapularis tears than other rotator cuff pathologies. We 
      suggest that subcoracoid effusion on MRI should also be considered in patients
      with a rotator cuff tear in whom a subscapularis tear was not detected in
      preoperative MRI and that the subscapularis tendon should be carefully evaluated 
      during surgery in cases where the effusion is positive. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 
      III; Retrospective Cohort Design; Diagnostic Study.

TI  - Late displacement after lateral condylar fractures of the humerus.
LID - S1058-2746(22)00567-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jse.2022.06.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nondisplaced or slightly displaced lateral condyle fractures may
      subsequently displace if treated with cast immobilization alone, and displacement
      indicates surgery. In this context, placing the forehand in pronation is
      sometimes recommended, and the prediction of the late displacement based on the
      presence of the fat pad sign is useful. However, few studies have quantitatively 
      shown the relationships between forearm position during immobilization and late
      displacement and between the presence of the fat pad sign and late displacement. 
      We investigated the factors that may affect the late displacement and the
      features of the consequences during the late displacement. METHODS: Between
      October 2003 and July 2020, we observed 62 patients (45 boys and 17 girls). We
      evaluated the correlation between the factors: age, gender, the initial
      displacement, the presence of a fat pad sign, the flexion angle of the elbow, the
      forearm position (pronation or neutral), and the late displacement on day 7 after
      the injury which means the difference between the displacement on day 0 and that 
      on day 7 in the 62 cases with the minimal displacement. Moreover, of all 62 cases
      observed, we further investigated those 52 cases that had been treated
      conservatively for three weeks for any resultant effects. We used Friedman's test
      to evaluate the difference in the late displacement on each day. We acknowledged 
      the p-value < 0.05 as significant. RESULTS: There was no significant correlation 
      between each factor (age, sex, initial displacement, presence of the fat pad
      sign, flexion angle of the elbow, or forearm position) and displacement on day 7,
      while there was significant progressive displacement until day 7. CONCLUSION: The
      present study concluded that the late displacement would happen until the seven
      postoperative dates, regardless of the splint angle, the fat pad sign, the age,
      or the gender. Therefore, it is important to follow any case, even with
      mild-displaced lateral condylar humeral fractures, until day 7 because the late
      displacement might occur.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of GSP301 nasal spray in children aged 6-11 with seasonal
      allergic rhinitis.
LID - S1081-1206(22)00653-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.anai.2022.07.029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: GSP301 nasal spray is a fixed-dose combination of the antihistamine
      olopatadine hydrochloride and the corticosteroid mometasone furoate. OBJECTIVE:
      Evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of GSP301 in pediatric subjects (>/=6
      to <12 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). METHODS: This double-blind, 
      randomized, parallel-group study, randomized 446 eligible patients 1:1 (GSP301
      [olopatadine hydrochloride 665 mug and mometasone furoate 25 mug] or placebo) as 
      1 spray/each nostril twice daily for 14 days. Primary endpoint was change from
      baseline in average AM and PM subject-reported 12-hour reflective Total Nasal
      Symptom Score (rTNSS) over 14-day treatment period analyzed using mixed-effect
      model repeated measures. Additional assessments included instantaneous TNSS
      (iTNSS), Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ),
      Total Ocular Symptoms Scores (rTOSS, iTOSS), individual symptoms,
      Physician-assessed Nasal Symptom Score (PNSS), and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS:
      GSP301 demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant
      improvement in rTNSS versus placebo (-0.6; 95% CI, -0.9 to -0.2; P =0.001).
      Statistically significant improvements favoring GSP301 were shown for all
      individual rTNSS symptoms, iTNSS and most of its individual symptoms, PNSS (P
      =0.01), and PRQLQ (P <0.001). For ocular symptoms, numerical improvements
      favoring GSP301 were observed, with statistical significance achieved only for
      reflective "tearing/watering eyes" (P =0.04). Treatment-emergent AEs occurred in 
      12.0% and 10.4% of patients in the GSP301 and placebo groups, respectively. One
      (0.5%) subject (placebo group) experienced a serious AE (suspected viral
      meningitis) not related to the study treatment and resolved. CONCLUSION: GSP301
      was well tolerated and efficacious for treating SAR symptoms in pediatric
      subjects and demonstrated a favorable safety profile. CLINICAL TRIAL

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine how Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT) methods can be used to
      assess the psychometric properties of the Aaniish Naa Gegii: the Children's
      Health and Well-being Measure (ACHWM) and Qanuippit. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:
      Indigenous children aged 8-18 years, from five communities, completed the 62-item
      ACHWM. We applied RMT methods to ACHWM data from 401 children (mean age 13.4 +/- 
      3.4 years; 51% male) from across Ontario to examine how well the items captured
      the full range (+/-3 logits) of the concept of interest in each domain, targeted 
      the needs of Indigenous children, and met the criteria for unidimensional and
      invariant measurement. RESULTS: RMT results indicated moderate fit overall fit
      (raw chi(2)=809, p<0.001). This model was further improved by aggregating the
      five response categories into three categories. All four domains showed excellent
      overall fit to the Rasch model (p >0.05); with items covering between -4.51 to
      6.02 logits, with no gaps along the theoretical continua. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      provides evidence that a set of conceptually derived items was able to produce a 
      measure that fits the Rasch model. These results aid our understanding of
      wellness by establishing the clinical meaning of the scale scores.

AB  - Among aquaculture vaccines, polyvalent vaccines (for immunoprotection against
      multiple bacterial species) are more efficient and can better avoid bacterial
      resistance and antibiotic residues in fish. Here, 15 outer membrane proteins
      (OMPs) of Aeromonas hydrophila were cloned and purified, and mouse antisera were 
      prepared. Passive immunization to Carassius auratus showed that four OMPs sera
      (OmpW, OmpAII, P5, and AHA2685) and the entire OMPs serum held effective
      immunoprotection against A. hydrophila infection. Furthermore, the active
      immunization of four OMPs to C. auratus showed that OmpW, OmpAII, P5, and AHA2685
      held effective immunoprotection against A. hydrophila, and OmpW held active
      cross-protection against Vibrio alginolyticus. The mechanisms of these four
      candidate vaccines in triggering immune responses were subsequently explored.
      They all could activate innate immune responses in active immunization,
      down-regulate (p<0.05) the inflammation-related genes expression to reduce the
      inflammatory reaction induced by A. hydrophila, and down-regulate (p<0.05)
      antioxidant-related factors to reduce the antioxidant reaction for bacterial
      infection. Noteablely, the four OMPs had protective abilities on kidney and
      spleen tissues of C. auratus after challenged with A. hydrophila and V.
      alginolyticus by histopathological observation. Collectively, our results
      identify OmpW as a polyvalent vaccine candidate, and OmpAII, P5, and AHA2685 as
      vaccine candidates against A. hydrophila infection in fish.

TI  - The effects of voluntary binge-patterned ethanol ingestion and daily wheel
      running on signaling of muscle protein synthesis and degradation in female mice.
LID - S0741-8329(22)00064-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.alcohol.2022.06.004 [doi]
AB  - Excessive ethanol ingestion can reduce skeletal muscle protein synthesis (MPS)
      through the disruption of signaling along the Akt-mTOR pathway and increase
      muscle protein degradation (MPD) through the Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway (UPP)
      and autophagy. Identification of interventions that curb the disrupting effects
      of alcohol misuse on MPS and MPD are of central importance for the prevention of 
      chronic health complications that arise from muscle loss. Physical activity is
      one potential strategy to combat the deleterious effects of alcohol on skeletal
      muscle. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction
      between daily wheel running and binge-patterned ethanol consumption, through
      episodes of voluntary binge-patterned ethanol drinking, on signaling factors
      along the Akt-mTOR, Ubiquitin-Proteasome, and autophagy pathways. Adult female
      C57BL/6J mice received daily access to cages with or without running wheels for
      2.5 hours/day for five weeks. During the final five days of the study, mice
      received 2-4 hours of daily access to sipper tubes containing water (n=14
      sedentary; n=15 running) or 20% ethanol (n=14 sedentary; n=16 running) 30 minutes
      after running wheel access, using the "Drinking in the Dark" (DID) model of
      binge-patterned ethanol consumption. Immediately after the final episode of DID
      gastrocnemius muscle was extracted. Western blotting was performed to measure
      proteins along Akt-mTOR, Ubiquitin-Proteasome, and autophagy pathways, and PCR
      was used to assess mRNA expression of atrogenes. Ethanol access increased
      expression of MAFbx by 82% (P=0.048) but did not robustly influence Akt-mTOR or
      UPP signaling. Daily wheel access did not prevent alcohol induced MAFbx
      expression, however, ethanol access decreased the phosphorylation of p70S6K by
      45% in running mice (P=0.020). These results suggest that physical activity may
      be insufficient to prevent alcohol-induced changes to signaling factors along
      pathways involved in muscle loss. Instead, binge-patterned ethanol ingestion may 
      impair the benefits of physical activity on factors involved in MPS.

LID - 10.1016/j.jvsv.2022.05.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endovenous stent placement has become a first-line approach to
      prevent post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with chronic post-thrombotic
      obstruction (PTO) or non-thrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVL) if conservative
      management fails. This study aims to identify factors associated with loss of
      patency to facilitate patient selection for endovenous stenting. METHODS: We
      retrospectively analyzed 108 consecutive patients following successful endovenous
      stenting for chronic vein obstruction performed at a single institution from
      January 2008 to July 2020. Using multivariable logistic regression, we explored
      potential predictive factors for loss of stent patency, including baseline
      demographics, postthrombotic changes as well as peak flow velocities measured in 
      the common femoral vein (CFV), deep femoral vein (DFV) and femoral vein (FV)
      using duplex ultrasound. RESULTS: Mean follow-up duration was 41 +/- 26 months
      and participants had a mean age of 47.4 +/- 15.4 years with 46.3% women. Ninety
      (83.3%) patients had PTO and 18 (16.7%) had NIVL, predominantly due to May
      Thurner syndrome. Loss of patency occurred in 20 (18,5%) patients, all treated
      for PTO. Comorbidities, side of intervention and sex did not differ between
      patients with occluded and patent stents. Stent occlusion was more common with
      increasing number of stents implanted (p < 0.001) and with distal stent extension
      into and beyond the CFV (p < 0.001). Preinterventional predictive factors for
      stent occlusion were lower duplex ultrasound peak velocity in the CFV (OR 7.52
      95% CI 2.54 - 22.28; p < 0.001) and FV (OR 10.75 95% CI 2.07 - 55.82; p < 0.005),
      as well as post-thrombotic changes in the DFV (OR 4.51 95% CI 1.53 - 13.25; p =
      0.006) and FV (OR 3.62 95% CI 1.11 - 11.84; p = 0.033). Peak velocities of </= 7 
      cm/s (IQR 0-20) in the CVF and </= 8 cm/s (IQR 5-10) in the FV were significantly
      associated with loss of patency CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient venous inflow as
      assessed by low peak velocities in the CFV and FV as well as postthrombotic
      findings represent reliable risk predictors for stent occlusions, warranting
      their inclusion into the decision-making process for invasive treatment of PTO.

TI  - Minimizing Opioid Use after Total Hip Arthroplasty: Comparing Periarticular
      Injection versus Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia versus a Combination
      Protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective management of postoperative pain after total hip
      arthroplasty (THA) may be challenging. We sought to develop an opioid-sparing
      pain management pathway by comparing the relative effectiveness of three
      different protocols: 1) Local anesthetic administered Patient-Controlled Epidural
      Analgesia (PCEA) without intrathecal opioids; 2) Periarticular Injection (PAI);
      and 3) PCEA + PAI. METHODS: In this double-blinded randomized controlled trial,
      180 patients undergoing THA were randomized to receive either (1) PCEA with 0.06%
      bupivacaine, (2) PAI, or (3) a PAI + PCEA with 0.06% bupivacaine. All patients
      received the same postoperative multimodal analgesic regimen. The primary outcome
      was opioid consumption, measured in Oral Morphine Equivalents (OME), at 24-, 48-,
      and 72-hours after anesthesia stop time. Secondary measures included pain at rest
      and with movement, opioid side effects, patient satisfaction, quality of
      recovery, as assessed via standardized self-reporting scales as well as surveys. 
      RESULTS: Opioid consumption was significantly higher in the PAI group in the
      first 24-hours postoperatively compared to the PAI+PCEA group (30 versus 15, p = 
      0.012). No differences were detected among groups for length of stay (LOS), pain 
      scores, patient satisfaction, or duration of surgery. More patients in the
      PAI+PCEA group were opiate-free in the first 24-hours compared to PAI (23.7
      versus 8.5%, p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Use of PAI+PCEA regimen was opioid-sparing 
      in the first 24-hours after surgery, favoring this group when opioid reduction is
      desired. Increased drowsiness was noted in the subsequent 24 to 48 hours once the
      epidural catheter was removed, and opioid consumption also increased.

TI  - Endovascular Repair Versus Open Surgical Repair for Complex Abdominal Aortic
      Aneurysms: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
LID - S0890-5096(22)00442-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.avsg.2022.06.102 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare
      the short and long-term outcomes of endovascular repair (ER) versus open surgical
      repair (OSR) for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAAAs), using
      propensity-matched and non-propensity-matched methods. METHODS: PubMed, OVID,
      Embase, ELSEVIER and Cochrane library were searched for the studies that compared
      ER versus OSR for CAAAs from January 1999 to December 2020. CAAAs were defined as
      short neck, juxtarenal, pararenal and suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. The 
      primary outcomes were 30-day mortality, 30-day reintervention, medium and
      long-term survival. We pooled outcomes of original studies and also performed
      subgroup analyses using RevMan. The analysis of statistical heterogeneity was
      performed with STATA 16.0. RESULTS: 21 studies with 12049 patients (3847 ERs,
      8202 OSRs) were included in this meta-analysis. In general, the patients
      undergoing ER were significantly older and likely to be man; more common with
      diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, renal failure, but smaller aortic
      aneurysms. In the non-propensity-matched subgroup analysis of ER versus OSR, ER
      was associated with significantly decreased 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR]:
      0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-0.74; P.001; I(2)=4%) and 30-day
      reintervention (OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.40-0.87; P = .007; I(2)=56%); lower rate of
      long-term survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.21-2.47; P = .002;
      I(2)=0%); less perioperative comorbidities including myocardial infarction,
      arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, permanent dialysis, wound complications, bowel
      ischemia; and shorter hospital length of stay. In the propensity-matched
      subgroup, ER was associated with poorer long-term survival (HR: 1.80; 95% CI:
      1.06-3.06; P = .03; I(2)=0%), higher incidences of lower extremity ischemia (OR: 
      12.25; 95% CI: 1.54-97.48; P = .02; I(2)=16%) and renal artery restenosis (OR:
      7.63; 95% CI: 1.35-43.24; P = .02). However, there was no significant difference 
      in 30-day mortality (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 0.65-2.66; P = .45; I(2)=0%), 30-day
      reintervention (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 0.62-4.03; P = .34; I(2)=26%), mid-term
      survival (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.30-3.56; P = .96; I(2)=0%) between ER and OSR
      groups. CONCLUSION: Our analyses suggest that OSR of CAAAs, compared with ER, is 
      associated with improved long-term survival without increasing of perioperative
      deaths. ER may be considered in the patients who are high-risk for open repair.

LID - 10.1016/j.avsg.2022.07.003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to evaluate the distance between the right
      common iliac artery (RCIA) and lumbar vertebra in asymptomatic patients in order 
      to determine whether such distance was statistically correlated with the left
      common iliac vein (LCIV) diameter (LCIVD) and to investigate if both measures
      were related to demographic characteristics and anthropometric data, such as sex,
      age, height, and body mass index (BMI). METHODS: In this descriptive and
      uncontrolled anatomic study, data from high-definition computed tomography (CT)
      angiography images of living kidney donors without a medical history of chronic
      venous insufficiency or past deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were analyzed. The RCIA
      crossed over the LCIV in 311 individuals, who were then included in this study.
      CT scans were reviewed to measure (1) the narrowest space between the RCIA and
      fifth lumbar vertebral body and (2) the LCIVD. Measures were subjected to
      normality tests and were divided according to the sex of the study population.
      Correlations of measures with age, BMI, and height were calculated. RESULTS: Of
      the 311 patients analyzed, 66.6% (n = 207) were female. The mean lumbar vertebral
      body-iliac artery distance (LVBIAD) was 7.2 mm, whereas the mean LCIVD was 8.5
      mm; both were higher in men (P < .001). The statistical analysis of LVBIAD and
      LCIVD distributions revealed no normality pattern (P < .05). The analysis of the 
      correlation between them showed a weak statistically significant relationship
      with age. A linear regression model considering the normality percentile interval
      indicated a strong positive correlation between LVBIAD and LCIVD (R(2) = .884).
      CONCLUSIONS: The LVBIAD was <5 mm and <3 mm in 25% and 5% of asymptomatic
      individuals, respectively. The LCIVD correlated with the space between the RCIA
      and lumbar vertebra. The distance between the RCIA and lumbar vertebra and the
      LCIVD were higher in male subjects and older patients, but did not correlate with
      BMI and height.

TI  - Effect of Endovascular Treatment on Urinary Obstruction Caused by Iliac Artery
      Aneurysm: A Case Series and Review of the Literature.
LID - S0890-5096(22)00440-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.avsg.2022.07.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is superior to open surgery
      repair (OSR) in multiple aspects and is the mainstay for noninflammatory iliac
      artery aneurysm (IAA) treatment. However, for noninflammatory IAAs with
      neighboring structures compressed, the experience of endovascular treatment is
      limited. This case series study aimed to describe the experience of EVAR of
      noninflammatory IAAs with urinary obstruction and to review the limited reports
      in the literature. METHODS: From December 2012 to July 2020, we reported seven
      cases of noninflammatory IAAs combined with urinary obstruction that were treated
      successfully with endovascular treatment. The literature on noninflammatory IAAs 
      combined with urinary obstruction was reviewed using the online databases PubMed,
      Embase, and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: Thirty-nine articles were found in the
      literature. OSR accounted for 80% of the treatment options in previous
      publications, while only 20% of patients accepted endovascular treatment.
      Hydronephrosis remission was observed in all patients treated by OSR, while the
      endovascular treatment group lacked long-term follow-up. In our retrospective
      study containing 7 cases, no complications, reintervention or mortality was
      observed, all stents were patent, and all symptoms were relieved after the
      operation. Diameter reduction of the aneurysms was observed in 6/7 cases, and the
      average aneurysm reduction was -24.1+/-15.8 mm (P=0.0097). Urinary obstruction
      faded in 5/7 cases where aneurysm shrinking was found simultaneously.
      CONCLUSIONS: This case series and literature review on noninflammatory IAAs
      combined with urinary obstruction suggests that the diameter of the responsible
      aneurysm may be reduced after endovascular treatment, which may also alleviate
      symptoms of urinary obstruction caused by noninflammatory IAAs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an
      atherosclerotic disease of the lower extremities. Atherosclerosis, inflammation
      and sarcopenia are independently associated and potentiate each other.
      Inflammation is deeply involved in the formation and progression of
      atherosclerosis and is also involved in the pathophysiology of sarcopenia.
      Sarcopenia is defined as low muscle mass, with low muscle strength. This study
      aims to determine the differences in skeletal muscle characteristics and in
      inflammatory parameters between patients with claudication and with chronic limb 
      threatening ischemia (CLTI). METHODS: An observational, prospective study in
      patients with PAD was conducted from January 2018 to December 2020. The clinical 
      characteristics and the cardiovascular risk factors were prospectively
      registered. The inflammatory parameters determined were: positive acute phase
      proteins (C-reactive Protein- CRP- and fibrinogen) and negative acute phase
      proteins (albumin, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein- HDL. The
      skeletal muscle area and density were quantified with a CT scan. The strength was
      determined with a Jamar(R) hydraulic hand dynamometer. RESULTS: 116 patients
      (mean age: 67.65+/-9.53 years-old) 64% with claudication and 46% with CLTI were
      enrolled in the study. No differences were registered between patients with
      claudication and CLTI on age, cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension,
      dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking habits) and medication. There was a
      higher prevalence of men in the claudication group (88.89% versus 71.70%,
      p=0.019). Analysing the inflammatory parameters, we noted that patients with CLTI
      had an increased serum levels of positive acute phase proteins: CRP
      (37.53+/-46.61mg/L versus 9.18+/-26.12mg/L, p=0.000), and fibrinogen
      (466.18+/-208.07mg/dL versus 317.37+/-79.42mg/dL, p=0.000). CLTI patients had
      decreased negative acute phase proteins: albumin (3.53+/-0.85g/dL versus
      3.91+/-0.72g/dL, p=0.001), total cholesterol (145.41+/-38.59mg/dL versus
      161.84+/-34.94mg/dL, p=0.013) and HDL (38.70+/-12.19mg/dL versus
      51.31+/-15.85mg/dL, p=0.000). We noted that patients with CLTI had lower skeletal
      muscle area and mass (14349.77+/-3036.60 mm(2)versus 15690.56+/-3183.97 mm(2)
      p=0.013; 10.11+/-17.03HU versus 18.02+/-13.63HU p=0.013). After adjusting for the
      variable sex, the association between skeletal muscle density and CLTI persisted 
      (r(97)=-0.232, p=0.021). The groups did not differ in strength (patients with
      claudication: 25.39+/-8.23 Kgf versus CLTI: 25.17+/-11.95 Kgf p=0.910).
      CONCLUSIONS: CLTI patients have decreased skeletal muscle mass and a systemic
      inflammation status. Recognizing the deleterious triad of atherosclerosis,
      inflammation and loss of skeletal mass patients with CLTI is an opportunity to
      improve medical therapy and to perform a timely intervention to stop this vicious
      cycle.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Penthorum chinense Pursh (PCP, Saxifragaceae) is 
      an edible plant and frequently-used Chinese herbal medicine, and is commonly used
      as Miao medicine in China. It showed well effect on alcoholic liver injury (ALI),
      but studies on its active ingredients and mechanisms against ALI remain at the
      starting stage. AIM OF THE STUDY: This work aims to explore the active
      ingredients and pharmacological mechanisms of PCP against ALI. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: First, network pharmacology was applied to decipher the potential active
      ingredients and pharmacological mechanisms of PCP against ALI by ingredient
      identification, ADMET evaluation, target identification, network construction and
      analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, and gene enrichment
      analysis. Second, molecular docking was used to explore the interaction between
      key active ingredient and hub protein of PCP against ALI. Then, the ingredient
      analysis of PCP aqueous extract and semiquantitative analysis of key active
      ingredient were carried out on HPLC-DAD. Subsequently, mice with ALI were used to
      investigate the therapeutic effect or verify the predicted mechanisms of PCP or
      key active ingredient against ALI by analyzing body weight, liver index, ALT and 
      AST activities in serum and liver tissues, oxidation related indices (SOD
      activity, GSH level and MDA level) in liver tissues, histopathology of liver
      tissues (oil red O, hematoxylin-eosin and DAB-TUNEL staining), and changes of
      related proteins (PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, Bax and Bcl-2) in liver tissues with the aid 
      of Western blot. RESULTS: Network pharmacology showed that the active ingredients
      and related genes of PCP against ALI comprised 10 ingredients and 52 genes. Based
      on the result of ingredient analysis of PCP aqueous extract, quercitrin was
      identified as the key active ingredient of PCP against ALI. PPI analysis
      indicated that AKT1 was the hub gene of PCP against ALI, and molecular docking
      suggested that there were good interaction between quercetin and Akt1 protein.
      Gene enrichment analysis showed that the pivotal molecular mechanism of PCP
      against ALI might be to inhibit hepatocyte apoptosis via activation of PI3K-Akt
      signaling pathway. PCP and quercitrin showed anti-ALI effect by offsetting weight
      loss and increase of liver index, and reversing the imbalance of oxidative stress
      and histopathological changes of liver tissues (abnormal fatty acid metabolism,
      hepatic cord swelling and inflammatory cell infiltration) in mice with ALI. PCP
      caused the decrease of DAB-TUNEL-positive cells, upregulated the anti-apoptotic
      proteins (PI3K, Akt and p-Akt) levels and the ratio of p-Akt/Akt, and
      downregulated pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) level and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in
      liver tissues of mice with ALI, indicating that the mechanism of PCP against ALI 
      involved in inhibiting hepatocyte apoptosis via activation of PI3K-Akt signaling 
      pathway. CONCLUSION: PCP and quercitrin showed well anti-ALI effect. The key
      active ingredient of PCP against ALI was identified as quercitrin. The underlying
      pharmacological mechanisms of PCP against ALI may be related to PI3K-Akt
      signaling pathway-mediated inhibition of hepatocyte apoptosis. This work provided
      new evidence to support the application of PCP in treatment of ALI, and a
      research basis for the research and development of functional foods or drugs
      against ALI from PCP.

LID - S1043-0679(22)00188-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.semtcvs.2022.06.022 [doi]
AB  - Guidelines for the management of gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma
      recommend esophagectomy as the preferred surgical treatment. Gastrectomy has been
      proposed as an equivalent procedure. This study aims to compare the oncologic
      outcomes of these operations. The National Cancer Database was queried for
      patients with clinical T1N0M0 (all sizes) and T2N0M0 (</=2cm) GEJ adenocarcinoma 
      from 2004-2017. Patients treated with surgery-only were included and were
      stratified by surgical treatment. Propensity-score matching (PSM) was used to
      create a balanced cohort. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to
      evaluate for factors predictive of treatment. Kaplan-Meier (KM) and Cox
      proportional hazards models were used to compare overall survival (OS). 2,446
      patients were identified. 75.1% received esophagectomy, while 24.9% were treated 
      with gastrectomy. Patients at high volume facilities were more likely to undergo 
      esophagectomy (OR 1.750, p<0.001). Factors associated with lower likelihood of
      undergoing esophagectomy included age >/=75 years (OR 0.588, p=0.001), female sex
      (OR 0.706, p=0.003), and non-White race (OR 0.430, p<0.001), compared to age
      </=50 years, male, and White race, respectively. In the unmatched cohort,
      gastrectomy was associated with a higher rate of positive margins (4.1% vs 2.3%, 
      p=0.022). PSM yielded 591 pairs. In the matched cohort, patients treated with
      esophagectomy had improved 5-year OS compared to gastrectomy (70.6% vs 66.5%,
      p=0.030). Multivariable analysis showed improved OS in patients treated with
      esophagectomy compared to gastrectomy (HR 0.767, p=0.010). Esophagectomy is
      associated with improved survival and a lower incidence of positive margins in
      patients with early-stage GEJ adenocarcinoma when compared to gastrectomy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hormone with pleiotropic
      metabolic effects, is inactivated by fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a
      member of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) family. We investigate if
      sitagliptin (DPP-IV inhibitor) inhibits FAP-activity and increases intact FGF21. 
      METHODS: Patients with impaired glucose metabolism were randomized to 100mg
      sitagliptin (n=34) or placebo (n=37) treatment for 12 weeks. Plasma samples
      obtained at study entry and at 12-weeks were analysed for FAP-activity, FAP,
      total FGF21 and intact FGF21. RESULTS: Sitagliptin significantly inhibited
      FAP-activity (497+/-553 vs. 48+/-712 RFU/min, p<0.01) and correspondingly
      increased intact FGF21 (253+/-182 vs 141+/-80ng/L, p<0.01) compared to placebo in
      plasma. Sitagliptin dose-dependently inhibited the FAP-activity in vitro. Intact 
      FGF21 was higher in patients obtaining a normal glucose tolerance regardless of
      treatment (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: A sitagliptin-induced increase of intact FGF21
      may contribute to an improved metabolic effect in patients with impaired glucose 
      metabolism.

AB  - Spanlastics are novel surfactant-based, elastic vesicular nanocarriers composed
      of spans and edge activators. The present work aims to exploit their special
      penetration enhancing properties to enhance the ophthalmic delivery of the
      versatile nutraceutical vanillic acid (VA) for treatment of ocular inflammation. 
      VA-loaded spanlastics were formulated by ethanol injection method using Tween 80,
      sodium deoxy cholate or Tween 60 as edge activators (EA) at various Span 60: EA
      mass ratios. Vesicles were characterized for their particle size (PS),
      polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE%), surface 
      morphology, in vitro release profile, thermal properties and long-term stability,
      in addition to in vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy of the selected formula in an
      endotoxin-induced uveitis model. Selected formulation composed of Span 60: Tween 
      80 at a mass ratio of 70:30 displayed smallest PS of 299.8 +/- 9.97nm, PDI of
      0.386+/- 0.047, an acceptable EE%, as well as good physical stability for 3
      months. According to clinical scoring, inflammatory mediators levels and
      histopathological examination, VA-loaded spanlastic formulation resulted in
      significant alleviation of inflammation compared to drug suspension (p<0.05).
      Formulation of VA into spanlastic nanoformulation is a promising approach to
      improve its ocular permeability, absorption and anti-inflammatory activity
      providing a safer alternative to current regimens.

AB  - The effect of temperature, salinity and body-size on depuration of naturally
      accumulated heavy metals in clams, mussels and oysters harvested from Ashtamudi
      and Vembanad estuaries of Kerala, India were investigated using a static
      depuration system. Before depuration, the concentrations of heavy metals such as 
      Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb and Zn were analysed and it was found that the Fe, Zn, Cu 
      and Pb contents in all the bivalves were above the prescribed limit which poses a
      significant health risk to bivalve consumers. To protect consumer food safety,
      depuration experiments were conducted at varying temperatures, salinities and
      body-sizes. The clams, mussels and oysters depurated under the room temperature
      depuration system (RTDS) showed a better reduction of heavy metals compared with 
      low-temperature depuration system (LTDS). ANOVA showed clams and mussels
      depurated at RTDS significantly (p<0.05) reduced the heavy metals than LTDS.
      However, there was no significant (p>0.05) difference in oysters between RTDS and
      LTDS. Further, clams and mussels depurated at low salinity (15-psmu) showed high 
      resistance against Pb reduction. But, all the heavy metals, particularly, Pb, Fe,
      Zn and Cu were effectively removed at higher salinity depuration (25-psmu and
      35-psmu). Moreover, irrespective of the body-size of clams, mussels and oysters
      used for depuration, a significant (p<0.05) reduction in all metals (Ni, Co, Fe, 
      Mn, Zn, Pb and Cu) was observed. Relatively, the medium-size bivalves showed
      higher reductions compared to small-size bivalves. Based on the experiments
      conducted, we recommend 48h depuration using the static system under room
      temperature (30+/-1 degrees C) with a salinity range of (25-35 psmu) using
      medium-size bivalves (clam>30mm; mussel >45mm, and oyster >65mm length) as
      optimum conditions for producing safe bivalves for consumption in the tropics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The sex differences in utilization, safety outcomes, and healthcare
      resource utilization of patients with PE undergoing percutaneous pulmonary artery
      thrombectomy are not well characterized. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the sex
      differences in outcomes for patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE)
      undergoing percutaneous pulmonary artery thrombectomy? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: 
      This retrospective cross-sectional study used national inpatient claims data to
      identify patients in the U.S. with a discharge diagnosis of PE who underwent
      percutaneous thrombectomy between January 2016 and December 2018. We evaluated
      the demographics, comorbidities, safety outcomes (in-hospital mortality) and
      healthcare resource utilization (discharge to home, length of stay, and hospital 
      charges) of PE patients undergoing percutaneous thrombectomy. RESULTS: Among
      1,128,904 patients with a diagnosis of PE between 2016 and 2018, 5,160 (0.5%)
      patients underwent percutaneous pulmonary artery thrombectomy. When compared to
      males, females had higher procedural bleeding (16.9 vs. 11.2%; P < 0.05),
      required more blood transfusions (11.9% vs. 5.7%; p < 0.05), and had more
      vascular complications (5.0% vs. 1.5%; P < 0.05). Females had higher in-hospital 
      mortality (16.9% vs 9.3%; adjusted OR: 1.9; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.0; P = 0.003) when
      compared to males. Although length of stay and hospital charges were similar to
      males, females were less likely to be discharged home after surviving
      hospitalization (47.9% vs. 60.3%; adjusted OR= 0.7; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.99; P =
      0.04). INTERPRETATION: In this large nationwide cohort, females with PE who
      underwent percutaneous thrombectomy had higher morbidity and in-hospital
      mortality compared to males.

TI  - Value of Angiographic Regional Circulation Signs in Predicting Hemorrhagic
      Transformation after Endovascular Thrombectomy.
LID - S0150-9861(22)00135-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.neurad.2022.07.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the
      early venous filling (EVF) sign, the basal ganglia blush (BGB) sign and both the 
      EVF and BGB signs for the hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and parenchymal
      hematoma (PH) in patients after endovascular thrombectomy. METHODS: This study
      included patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusive stroke treated
      with endovascular thrombectomy from May 2017 to December 2021. The predictive
      value of regional circulation signs for HT and PH were assessed using logistic
      regression models adjusted for confounders, and further a multiplicative
      interaction term was added to investigate the effect of different stroke severity
      on its predictive value. RESULTS: Among the 350 patients included and after
      adjusting for confounders, those with the EVF sign (adjusted OR=3.934, 95%
      CI:2.326-6.655), the BGB sign (adjusted OR=3.776, 95% CI:2.341-6.089), and both
      the EVF and BGB signs (adjusted OR=3.250, 95% CI: 1.886-5.600) were more likely
      to have HT. The EVF sign (adjusted OR=3.545, 95% CI:2.036-6.170), the BGB sign
      (adjusted OR=3.742, 95% CI:2.110-6.639), and both the EVF and BGB signs (adjusted
      OR=3.139, 95% CI: 1.776-5.549) were also significantly correlated with PH. When
      stratified according to stroke severity, we further found there were significant 
      interactions between regional circulation signs and stroke severity on
      postoperative HT and PH (all P for interaction < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Regional
      circulation signs were independently associated with HT and PH after endovascular
      thrombectomy and had a higher predictive value in patients with severe stroke
      compared with mild to moderate stroke.

AB  - The Na(+),K(+)-ATPase generates electrochemical gradients of Na(+) and K(+)
      across the plasma membrane via a functional cycle that includes various
      phosphoenzyme intermediates. However, the structure and function of these
      intermediates and how metal fluorides mimick them require further investigation. 
      Here, we describe a 4.0 A resolution crystal structure and functional properties 
      of the pig kidney Na(+),K(+)-ATPase stabilized by the inhibitor beryllium
      fluoride (denoted E2-BeFx). E2-BeFx is expected to mimic properties of the E2P
      phosphoenzyme, yet with unknown characteristics of ion and ligand binding. The
      structure resembles the E2P form obtained by phosphorylation from inorganic
      phosphate (Pi) and stabilized by cardiotonic steroids, including a low-affinity
      Mg(2+) site near ion binding site II. Our anomalous Fourier analysis of the
      crystals soaked in Rb(+) (a K(+) congener) followed by a low-resolution
      rigid-body refinement (6.9-7.5 A) revealed pre-occlusion transitions leading to
      activation of the dephosphorylation reaction. We show that the Mg(2+) location
      indicates a site of initial K(+) recognition and acceptance upon binding to the
      outward-open E2P state after Na(+) release. Furthermore, using binding and
      activity studies, we find that the BeFx-inhibited enzyme is also able to bind
      ADP/ATP and Na(+). These results relate the E2-BeFx complex to a transient K(+)- 
      and ADP-sensitive E*P intermediate of the functional cycle of the
      Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, prior to E2P.

AB  - As the representative genetic and economic trait of ornamental fish, skin color
      has a strong impact on speciation and adaptation. However, the genetic basis of
      skin color pigmentation, differentiation and change is still not understood. The 
      Midas cichlid fish with three typical body color transition stages of
      "black-graygold" is an ideal model system for investigating the formation and
      change of fish body color. In this study, to investigate the regulatory role of
      the pair box 3 (pax3) gene in the early body color fading process of Midas
      cichlids, the complete cDNA sequence (3513bp) of pax3 was successfully isolated
      from Midas cichlids (Amphilophus Citrinellus), and found to encode polypeptides
      of 491 amino acids. Expression patterns of the pax3 gene in tissues of Midas
      cichlids during different periods, including embryonic development and body color
      fading stages were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The qRT-PCR analysis
      showed that pax3 was expressed in all tissues of adult fish, with a higher
      expression level in muscle and skin. The highest expression level in muscle
      tissue was significantly higher than that in other tissues (P<0.05). During
      embryonic development, the expression tendency of pax3 was first increased and
      then decreased. In the three typical stages of early skin color fading from black
      to gold, pax3 expression in skin, caudal fin and scales all showed a downward
      trend. The expression level in the black stage was significantly higher than that
      in other stages (P<0.05). Positive signal of Pax3 protein was detected in the
      three typical skin color conversion stages, and the highest positive signal
      intensity was detected in the black stage, which was consistent with qRT-PCR
      results. After pax3 RNA interference, pax3 and the downstream genes mitf and tyr 
      all decreased, while dct mRNA expression increased in the skin of fish. Western
      blotting also showed a decrease in Pax3 protein concentration. Those results
      suggest that pax3 plays an important role in skin color formation, distribution
      and change in Midas cichlids through the melanogenesis pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculomotor nerve palsy is a known risk in the surgical management of 
      intracranial aneurysms. The aim of the present study is to determine the risk
      factors for surgery-induced OMNP. METHODS: The study retrospectively examined 585
      patients with posterior communicating artery aneurysms treated surgically between
      January 2000 and July 2019. These patients were categorized into two groups
      according to whether they exhibited OMNP or not: i) Absent; and ii) Present.
      Multiple factors, including sex, age, history of SAH, Hunt-Hess grade, Fisher
      score, preoperative time, sizes, sides, number, orientation, intraoperative
      rupture or not and morphology, were analyzed to identify factors associated with 
      surgery-induced OMNP. RESULTS: The overall OMNP rate was 4.4%. In univariate
      analysis, large size (P0.001), posterior infratentorial projection (P=0.003),
      great number of SAH (P=0.005) or late preoperative time (P0.001) were associated 
      with an increased risk of OMNP. Overall, the multivariate logistic regression
      analysis showed that sizes (10.1-25mm, OR=30.083, P=0.001, 95% CI: 3.703-244.419;
      >25mm, OR=62.179, P=0.012, 95% CI: 2.402-1609.418), intraoperative rupture
      (OR=3.018, P=0.035, 95% CI: 1.083-8.412) and preoperative time (>14 days,
      OR=10.985, P0.001, 95% CI: 3.840-31.428) were independent risk factors of
      surgery-induced OMNP. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that sizes,
      intraoperative rupture and preoperative time were independent predictors of
      surgery-induced OMNP. And we can assist some advanced technologies in the
      operation process to avoid this situation.

LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2022.07.105 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aims to identify independent factors associated with cervical
      spinal injuries in head-injured patients. The extent of injuries to other body
      parts was assessed by the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and was included in the 
      analysis. METHODS: Consecutive head-injured patients admitted via the Emergency
      Department from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed.
      The inclusion criteria were head-injured patients with an Abbreviated Injury
      Scale (AIS) score >/=2 (i.e. head injuries with intracranial hematoma or skull
      fracture). Minor head injuries with only scalp abrasions or superficial
      lacerations without significant intracranial injuries (i.e. head injury AIS score
      = 1) were excluded. The primary outcome is to identify independent predictors
      associated with cervical spinal injuries in these head-injured patients.
      Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted. RESULTS: 1105 patients were
      identified. 11.2% (124/1105) had cervical spinal injuries. Univariate and
      multivariable analyses identified male gender (p=0.006), the presence of thoracic
      injury (including rib fracture, hemothorax, or pneumothorax) (p=0.010), and
      hypotension with systolic blood pressure <90mmHg upon admission (p=0.009), as
      independent predictors for cervical spinal injury in head-injured patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that about one in ten patients with significant
      head injury had cervical spine injury, usually associated with fracture or
      dislocation. Male gender, the presence of thoracic injury, and hypotension upon
      admission were independent risk factors associated with cervical spinal injuries.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the clinical outcomes of a percutaneous lumbar transforaminal
      endoscopic discectomy (PTED) with intraoperative computed tomography (iCT)
      navigation for the treatment of L5-S1 far-lateral lumbar disc herniation (LDH).
      METHODS: A total of 30 patients with L5-S1 far-lateral LDH who underwent PTED
      with iCT navigation from September 2016 to October 2020 were enrolled in this
      study. Outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, the
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score,
      the EQ-5D-5L and the modified Macnab criteria. Pre- and postoperative
      complications were recorded. RESULTS: The mean VAS score for leg pain improved
      from 8.1 at baseline to 2.3, 0.9, 0.7 and 0.9 at 1 day, 1 week, 6 months, and 12 
      months postoperatively, respectively (P<0.01). The mean ODI improved from 78.1%
      at baseline to 45.5%, 21.9%, 12.6%, and 11.7% at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and
      12 months postoperatively, respectively (P<0.01), and the mean JOA score improved
      from 8.6 at baseline to 14.2, 20.2, 24.4, and 25.6 at 1 day, 1 week, 6 months,
      and 12 months postoperatively, respectively (P<0.01). At 12 months
      postoperatively, the EQ-5D-5L value significantly increased, from -0.061+/-0.138 
      to 0.903 +/- 0.064. The rate of a good or excellent modified Macnab result was
      93% (26/28) at 12 months postoperatively. In the present study, combined L5-S1
      foraminal stenosis tended to lead to poor outcomes, which required more
      postsurgical treatment. CONCLUSION: With iCT navigation, PTED is a feasible and
      effective minimally invasive surgery for L5-S1 far-lateral LDH.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the worldwide impact of a virtual Neurosurgery-Neuroscience
      Lecture Series on optimizing neurosurgical education with tele-teaching. METHODS:
      A retrospective analysis was performed from our Zoom database to collect data
      from October 15, 2020, to December 14, 2020, and from September 27, 2021, to
      December 13, 2021. A comparative analysis of participants in the two different
      timeframes was performed to investigate the impact of tele-teaching on
      neurosurgical education worldwide. To evaluate participant satisfaction, the
      yearly Continuing Medical Education reports of 2020-2021 were analyzed. Data
      related to the distribution of lectures by subspecialties were also described.
      RESULTS: Among the 11 lectures of the first period, a total of 257 participants
      from 17 countries in 4 different continents were recorded, with a mean of 64
      (SD=9,30) participants for each meeting; 342 attendees participated from 19
      countries in 5 continents over the 11 lectures of the second part, with an
      average of 82,8 (SD=14,04) attendees.; a statistically significant increase in
      participation between the two periods was identified (p<0.001) A total of 19
      (2020) and 21 (2021) participants submitted the Continuing Medical Education
      yearly survey. More than 86,4% of overall responses considered the lectures
      "excellent. Main topics reported during lectures in 2020-2021 were related to
      brain tumors (33,7%) and education (22,1%). CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 pandemic
      has increased the need to introduce new educational approaches for teaching novel
      ways to optimize patient care. Our multidisciplinary web-based virtual lecture
      series could represent an innovative tele-teaching platform in neurosurgical
      training.

TI  - The lateral supraorbital craniotomy approach for anterior circulation aneurysms: 
      A modern surgical case series in the endovascular era.

LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2022.07.107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The lateral supraorbital (LSO) approach is a minimally-invasive
      modification of the standard pterional approach to anterior circulation
      aneurysms. OBJECTIVE: We describe a dual-trained cerebrovascular neurosurgeon's
      first 18-month experience with the LSO approach, including decision-making
      criteria and lessons learned. METHODS: This retrospective case series analyzed 50
      consecutive patients treated with an LSO craniotomy for aneurysm clipping by a
      single surgeon. Aneurysms were broken down into 3 categories by location: ICA,
      ACoA, and MCA. Surgical characteristics were evaluated for differences by
      location and rupture status. RESULTS: 50 patients with 57 aneurysms underwent
      aneurysm clipping via LSO. Fixed retraction was employed less often in patients
      with ICA aneurysms than in those with ACoA, MCA, or multiple aneurysms (10% vs.
      68.2%, 45.5%, and 42.9%, respectively, p=0.02). Twenty-six patients (52%)
      presented with SAH; the majority of these (92.3%) presented with Hunt-Hess Grade 
      1-3. There were no differences in intraoperative rupture rates, fixed retractor
      use, operative duration, or estimated blood loss by rupture status. Adverse
      events included 1 patient (2%) with permanent frontalis nerve palsy, 1 with
      temporalis atrophy, and 1 with transient aphasia. No postoperative hematomas or
      strokes were observed. CONCLUSION: The LSO approach can safely and effectively
      treat anterior circulation aneurysms should be considered a viable
      minimally-invasive option for aneurysm clipping. Further studies comparing the
      LSO approach with other cranial approaches are needed.

LID - 10.1016/j.ajic.2022.07.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence-based intraoperative infection control measures can reduce
      Staphylococcus aureus transmission and infections. We aimed to determine whether 
      transmitted S. aureus isolates were associated with increased risk of multidrug
      resistance and associated traits. METHODS: S. aureus isolates obtained from
      intraoperative environmental, patient skin, and provider hand reservoirs among
      274 operating room case pairs (1(st) and 2(nd) case of the day) across 3 major
      academic medical centers from March 2009 to February 2010 underwent
      systematic-phenotypic-genomic analysis to identify clonal transmission events.
      The association of clonal S. aureus transmission with multidrug resistance and
      resistance traits was investigated. Transmission dynamics were characterized.
      RESULTS: Transmitted isolates (N=58) were associated with increased risk of
      multi-drug antibiotic resistance [33% (19/58) transmitted vs. 10% (12/115) other 
      isolates, risk ratio 3.14, 99% CI 1.34-7.38, P=0.0006]. Transmission was
      associated with a significant increase in resistance traits including mecA [40%
      transmitted isolates vs. 17% other isolates, risk ratio 2.28, P=0.0026] and ant
      (6)-Ia [26% transmitted isolates vs. 9% other isolates, risk ratio 2.97,
      P=0.0050]. Provider hands were a frequent reservoir of origin, between-case a
      common mode of transmission, and patient skin and provider hands frequent
      transmission locations for multidrug resistant pathogens. CONCLUSIONS:
      Intraoperative S. aureus transmission was associated with multidrug resistance
      and resistance traits. Proven infection control measures should be leveraged to
      target intraoperative transmission of multidrug resistant pathogens.

LID - 10.1016/j.cca.2022.07.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a well-established risk factor for
      cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to identify the biological variation of ten
      cardiovascular biochemical markers in T2DM patients to aid in their
      interpretation. METHODS: Blood samples for evaluating ten biomarkers were
      collected biweekly from 23 T2DM patients (10 men, 13 women) for three months. The
      analytical variability and variations of within-subject (CVI) and between-subject
      (CVG) levels were calculated, as well as the analytical performance
      specifications, reference change value (RCV), and index of individuality (II).
      RESULTS: The levels of total cholesterol (CHOL), apolipoprotein A (apoA),
      homocysteine (HCY), high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain 
      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) differed between males and females (P<0.05). The 
      CVIs or CVGs of the biomakers were higher than those of healthy participants in
      Westgard online database, except for hsTnT. Triglyceride (TG), lipoprotein (a)
      [Lp(a)] and NT-proBNP had relatively high CVI, CVG and RCV, whereas CHOL,
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apoA and HCY showed low variation. 
      Moreover, the II of HDL-C, LP(a), apoA, HCY and hsTnT was <0.6 and other
      biochemical markers was between 0.6 and 1.4. CONCLUSION: The cardiovascular
      biochemical markers in T2DM patients showed higher CVI or CVG, except for hsTnT. 
      ApoA had the lowest CVI and CVG values. Population-based reference intervals
      should be used with caution in clinical decision-making for T2DM patients.

AB  - In the present study, the whole seaweed from Kappaphycus alvarezii (containing
      carrageenan) was used for preparation of bio-nanocomposite films by blending with
      metal oxide nanoparticles such as zinc oxide (ZnONPs), cupric oxide (CuONPs) and 
      silicon dioxide (SiO2NPs) for multiple applications, and their properties were
      compared with standard refined kappa-Carrageenan (commercial grade).
      Simultaneously, the antibacterial activity and biodegradation profile of the
      prepared bio-nanocomposite film were also studied. The incorporation of
      nanoparticles into the bioplastic film matrices altered the surface morphology,
      increased the roughness and significantly (p<0.05) reduced the UV transmittance, 
      water uptake ratio (WUR), moisture content and solubility in both standard
      carrageenan-based bio-nanocomposite films (CBF) and Kappaphycus- based
      bio-nanocomposite films (KBF) compared to control. The average roughness (Ra) of 
      KBF increased compared to CBF; however, CBF showed better tensile strength
      compared to KBF. Both KBF and CBF loaded with nanoparticles exhibited strong
      antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
      However, KBF performed better compared to CBF. Antimicrobial effect of
      nanoparticles delayed the degradation of the bio-nanocomposite films. The present
      study proposes that the whole seaweed (Kappaphycus alvarezii) can be used
      directly for multiple industrial applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) following hip and knee arthroplasty
      poses serious health and economic burden. AIM: To evaluate SSI management
      strategies and outcomes to help address this problem. METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective cohort study of adults undergoing primary total hip or knee
      arthroplasty who were identified to have a complex SSI by infection prevention
      and control surveillance audit. Audits identified SSI within 90 days of
      arthroplasty. Patients at two tertiary referral centres in Edmonton, Alberta,
      Canada from 2012 to 2019 were included and SSI cases were followed for two years.
      FINDINGS: We identified 240 SSIs and found that 202 (84%) were managed with
      debridement with antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR), of which 71% achieved 
      cure. The use of any topical intra-operative antibiotic in DAIR was not
      associated with improved outcome (OR = 1.68, 95% CI 0.91 - 3.10, p-value =
      0.097). DAIR performed at 31-90 days from arthroplasty had lower chance of cure
      compared to DAIR performed within 30 days, however this was not statistically
      significant (60 vs 73%, p-value = 0.123). Initial treatment failures requiring
      additional surgery had 51% cure. The majority (78%) of treatment failures
      initially managed with DAIR ultimately required two-stage revision. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We provide insight from a population-based perspective on the surgical management
      of SSIs after primary total hip and knee arthroplasty in a large cohort.
      Additionally, we follow SSIs that had initial management failure. This data can
      inform future studies such as the economic burden associated with these
      infections, and plan interventions to optimize SSI management.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in both sexes and the
      second in terms of mortality. Apart from genetic predisposition, dietary and
      lifestyle factors have been implicated in the development of CRC. Several studies
      suggested that vitamin D (VitD) might be a promising strategy in CRC prevention, 
      while other studies did not confirm this finding. The aim of our study was to
      examine the role of Vit-D supplementation in the prevention of colorectal
      neoplasms (CRC and polyps). We conducted a systematic search in Pubmed, Embase
      and Web of Science databases for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining
      the incidence of colorectal neoplasms in patients taking Vit-D supplementation
      compared to placebo. We synthetized results using Risk Ratio along with 95%
      Confidence Intervals (CIs). Nine RCTs (N=71,386) were included. Non-significant
      correlations were observed between Vit-D supplementation and CRC incidence
      (RR:1.06, p=0.52). Similarly, non-significant associations were observed between 
      the use of Vit-D supplements and colorectal adenoma incidence (RR:1.00, p=0.91). 
      Advanced adenomas (OR:1.05, p=0.63) and serrated polyps (RR:1.03, p=0.63) were
      also not significantly inversely associated with Vit-D supplementation. Our study
      shows that Vit-D does not seem to have a role in the chemoprevention of
      colorectal neoplasms. However, additional well-designed studies are needed in
      order to draw safe conclusions. A potentially beneficial role of Vit-D
      supplementation in CRC primary prevention in individuals with severe vitamin D
      deficiency as well in the primary prevention of early-onset CRC, requires further
      investigation.

TI  - Cardiac function in childhood cancer survivors treated with vincristine:
      Echocardiographic results from the DCCSS LATER 2 CARD study.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2022.07.049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anthracyclines and radiotherapy involving the heart region are
      cardiotoxic, but the potential cardiotoxicity of vincristine remains unknown. We 
      assessed cardiac function in vincristine-treated >5-year childhood cancer
      survivors (CCS). METHODS AND RESULTS: We cross-sectionally compared
      echocardiograms of 101 vincristine-treated CCS (median age 35years [range:
      17-53], median vincristine dose 63mg/m(2)) from the national Dutch Childhood
      Cancer Survivor Study, LATER cohort, to 101 age- and sex-matched controls. CCS
      treated with anthracyclines, radiotherapy involving the heart region,
      cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide were excluded. Twelve CCS (14%) versus four
      controls (4%; p 0.034) had a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; 
      men <52%, women <54%). Mean LVEF was 58.4% versus 59.7% (p 0.050). Global
      longitudinal strain (GLS) was abnormal in nineteen (24%) CCS versus eight
      controls (9%; p 0.011). Mean GLS was 19.0% versus 20.1% (p 0.001). No >/=grade 2 
      diastolic dysfunction was detected. In multivariable logistic regression analysis
      CCS had higher risk of abnormal GLS (OR 3.55, p 0.012), but not abnormal LVEF (OR
      3.07, p 0.065), than controls. Blood pressure and smoking history contributed to 
      variation in LVEF, whereas obesity and diastolic blood pressure contributed to
      variation in GLS. Cumulative vincristine dose was not associated with either
      abnormal LVEF or abnormal GLS in multivariable models corrected for age and sex
      (OR per 50mg/m(2): 0.88, p 0.85 and 1.14, p 0.82, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
      Vincristine-treated long-term CCS showed an abnormal GLS more frequently than
      controls. Their risk for future clinical cardiac events and the role of risk
      factor modification should be further elucidated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of increasing temperatures on renal function in heart
      failure (HF) outpatients has never been specifically analyzed. METHODS: We
      retrieved creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values of
      all HF outpatients followed at a HF clinic and temperature data from 2002 to
      2021. For each patient and each year we averaged values of creatinine, eGFR and
      monthly temperatures during summer and the rest of the year. RESULTS: The study
      cohort included 2167 HF patients undergoing 25,865 elective visits, with a median
      of 14 visits for each patient (interquartile range 7-23). At the first visit,
      patients (70% men) had an age of 67+/-13years, and a left ventricular ejection
      fraction of 35+/-14%. Creatinine was 1.25+/-0.51mg/dL, and eGFR was
      65+/-25mL/min/1.73m(2). When pooling together all average values of creatinine
      and eGFR measured during summer or in the rest of the year, creatinine was
      significantly higher in summer (difference 0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      0.04 to 0.05, p<0.001), and eGFR was slightly lower (difference-2.0, 95% CI -2.3 
      to -1.8, p<0.001). Temperature rise during summer increased from 2002 to 2021.
      The absolute (Delta) and percent (Delta%) elevation in temperature during summer 
      displayed independent associations with Delta and Delta% creatinine and eGFR
      after adjusting for age, sex, plasma creatinine, and HF therapies. CONCLUSIONS:
      The magnitude of temperature elevation during summer has increased over 20years. 
      This elevation correlates with the decline in renal function during summer. This 
      might be an example of how global warming is affecting human health.

LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2022.07.025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For extrathoracic malignancies that have metastasized to the lungs,
      previous investigations have demonstrated both oncologic and survival benefits
      following pulmonary and repeat metastasectomy. Little is known regarding the
      feasibility of incrementally increasing numbers of subsequent metastasectomy
      procedures. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who
      underwent >/= 3 pulmonary resection procedures for recurrent, metachronous
      metastatic disease of non-lung primary malignancies at a single institution
      between 1992 and 2020. Primary outcomes collected pertained to safety and
      feasibility, including estimated blood loss (EBL), hospital length of stay (LOS),
      and details regarding postoperative complications. RESULTS: 117 patients met
      inclusion criteria, having undergone at least 3 metastasectomy operations, with
      56 (47.9%) undergoing a fourth operation and 21 (17.9%) undergoing a fifth
      operation. EBL did not differ between first and second operations (106.6 vs.
      102.5, p= 0.76, Table). It was, however, significantly greater at third
      operations (102.5 vs. 238.7, p= 0.000016). We noted an increase in wound
      complications between the second and third operations (0.9% vs. 6.8%, p= 0.02),
      and incremental increases in likelihood of prolonged air leak with each
      subsequent operation. The need for reoperation was low for all and similar
      between each operation. Importantly, LOS was similar among all procedures, as
      were the frequencies of hospital readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Third-time redo
      pulmonary metastasectomy can be performed safely and feasibly in select patients.
      Further repeat resection should remain a therapeutic option for patients, though 
      risks for potentially longer operating time, greater EBL, and prolonged air leaks
      may be anticipated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2018, a United Network Organ for Sharing (UNOS) policy change
      increased prioritization of patients bridged with temporary mechanical
      circulatory support devices such VA- ECMO for cardiac transplantation.
      Considering increased waitlist acuity, we sought to characterize whether this was
      associated with an increased risk of developing post-operative renal failure
      requiring dialysis (AKI-D), and risk of mortality, following transplant. METHODS:
      Dialysis-naive adults receiving single-organ heart transplant between November
      2009 to February 2020 were stratified by receipt of AKI-D. Eras 1 and 2 were
      defined by the periods of pre- and post-UNOS allocation policy change,
      respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine risk
      factors for AKI-D. Rates of AKI-D were compared using propensity-matched cohorts.
      Survival was compared using Kaplan Meier analysis. RESULTS: A total of 20,698
      patients were included. VA-ECMO usage significantly increased in era 2 (5.6% vs. 
      0.58%; p<0.01). Overall prevalence of AKI-D was greater in era 2 (13.5% vs.
      10.2%; p<0.01). Use of preoperative ECMO, intra-aortic balloon pump, ventilators,
      and greater ischemic times were identified as independent risk factors for
      developing AKI-D. Five- and ten-year survival were significantly decreased for
      patients who developed AKI-D. There was no short-term survival difference between
      AKI-D patients from era 2 and AKI-D patients from the more contemporary era 1.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients who develop post-transplant AKI-D have significantly worse 
      short and long-term outcomes. Use of preoperative ECMO, pre-operative ventilator 
      support, and greater ischemic times are risk factors for developing AKI-D and
      their prevalence has increased since the allocation policy change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression is a common mental disease in obstetric
      puerperium. Its etiology is not completely clear, and its clinical manifestations
      are complex. It has serious adverse effects on the body and mind of mothers and
      infants. Treatment should also follow the principle of individualization.
      Preliminary studies have shown that traditional chinese medicine prescriptions
      combined with paroxetine is effective in treating postpartum depression. In order
      to better determine the therapeutic effect, further exploration was carried out. 
      HYPOTHESIS: Does the study better evaluate the therapeutic effect and provide
      data support for clinical promotion ? STUDY DESIGN: The search comes from using
      the following electronic databases established until January 2022. STUDY RESULTS:
      The meta analysis results show that paroxetine combined with traditional chinese 
      medicine prescriptions can reduce the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score [WMD
      = -7.35, 95% CI (-10.84, -3.87), P0.001] and Edinburgh Postpartum Depression
      Scale (EPDS) score [WMD = -3.24, 95% CI (-5.96, -0.53), P<0.001].And better than 
      paroxetine treatment alone in terms of improving clinical efficacy [RR = 1.22,
      95% CI (1.16, 1.30), P <0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the combination of
      paroxetine and traditional chinese medicine prescriptions in the treatment of
      postpartum depression, there is a certain clinical effect, and a strong research 
      design and a certain number of RCTs are required at the same time. Future
      research should clarify the specific composition and composition of traditional
      Chinese medicine prescriptions.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of supplementing feed with arazyme and dietary
      carbohydrolases derived from invertebrate gut-associated symbionts on the noxious
      gas emissions, gut microbiota, and host-microbiome interactions of pigs. Here,
      270 and 260 growing pigs were assigned to control and treatment groups,
      respectively. The tested feed additives contained a mixture of arazyme (2,500,000
      Unit/kg) and synergetic enzymes, xylanase (200,000 Unit/kg) and mannanase
      (200,000 Unit/kg), derived from insect gut-associated symbionts in a 7.5:1:1
      ratio. The control group was fed a basal diet and the treatment group was fed the
      basal diet supplemented with 0.1% enzyme mixture (v/v) for 2months. Odorous gases
      were monitored in ventilated air from tested houses. Fecal samples were collected
      from steel plate under the cage at the completion of the experiment to determine 
      chemical composition, odor emissions, and bacterial communities. There was a
      significant decrease in the concentration of NH3 (22.5 vs. 11.2ppm; P<0.05), H2S 
      (7.35 vs. 3.74ppm; P<0.05), trimethylamine (TMA) (0.066 vs. 0.001ppm; P<0.05),
      and p-cresol (0.004ppm vs. 0ppm; P<0.05) at 56 d in treatment group compared with
      the control group. Moreover, fecal analysis results showed that exogenous enzyme 
      supplementation caused a reduction in VFAs and indole content with approximately 
      >60% and 72.7%, respectively. The result of gas emission analysis showed that NH3
      (9.9 vs. 5.3ppm; P<0.05) and H2S (5.8 vs. 4.1ppm; P<0.05) were significantly
      reduced in the treatment group compared to the control group. The gut microbiota 
      of the treatment group differed significantly from that of the control group, and
      the treatment group altered predicted metabolic pathways, including sulfur and
      nitrogen related metabolism, urea degradation. The results demonstrated that
      supplementing feed with arazyme with dietary carbohydrolases effectively controls
      noxious gas emissions and improves health and meat quality of pigs.

TI  - Responses of diversity and arsenic-transforming functional genes of soil
      microorganisms to arsenic hyperaccumulator (Pteris vittata L.)/pomegranate
      (Punica granatum L.) intercropping.

AB  - Intercropping of arsenic (As) hyperaccumulator (Pteris vittata L.) with crops can
      reduce the As concentration in soil and the resulting ecological and health
      risks, while maintaining certain economic benefits. However, it is still unclear 
      how As-transforming functional bacteria and dominant bacteria in the rhizosphere 
      of P. vittata affect the microbial properties of crop rhizosphere soil, as well
      as how As concentration and speciation change in crop rhizosphere soil under
      intercropping. This is of great significance for understanding the biogeochemical
      cycle of As in soil and crops. This study aimed to use high-throughput sequencing
      and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to analyze the effects of
      different rhizosphere isolation patterns on the bacterial diversity and the copy 
      number of As-transforming functional genes in pomegranate (Punica granatum L.)
      rhizosphere soil. The results showed that the abundance of bacteria in the
      rhizosphere soil of pomegranate increased by 16.3%, and the soil bacterial
      community structure significantly changed. C_Alphaproteobacteria and
      o_Rhizobiales bacteria significantly accumulated in the rhizosphere of
      pomegranate. The copy number of As methylation (arsM) gene in pomegranate
      rhizosphere soil significantly increased by 63.37%. The concentrations of
      nonspecifically sorbed As (F1), As associated with amorphous Fe (hydr)oxides
      (F3), and the total As (FT) decreased; the proportion of As (III) in pomegranate 
      rhizosphere soil decreased; and the proportion of As (V) increased in pomegranate
      rhizosphere soil. c_Alphaproteobacteria and o_Rhizobiales accumulated in crop
      rhizosphere soil under the intercropping of P. vittata with crops. Also, the copy
      number of As methylation functional genes in crop rhizosphere soil significantly 
      increased, which could reduce As (III) proportion in crop rhizosphere soil. These
      changes favored simultaneous agricultural production and soil remediation. The
      results provided the theoretical basis and practical guidance for the safe
      utilization of As-contaminated soil in the intercropping of As-hyperaccumulator
      and cash crops.

AB  - The wide application of organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) in consumer
      products leads to their ubiquitous occurrence. The neurotoxicity of OPFRs has
      been raised, whereas evidence from the elderly population were rather scarce.
      Hence, a case-control study was conducted based on the Shenzhen Aging-related
      Disorder Cohort. A total of 184 cases [Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE)<24]
      and 795 participants as controls (MMSE >/=24) were recruited. Eight metabolites
      of OPFRs (m-OPFRs) in urine samples were measured, including bis(2-butoxyethyl)
      phosphate (BBOEP), bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEP), bis(1-chloro-2-propyl)
      phosphate (BCIPP), bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP), dibutyl
      phosphate (DBP), di-o-cresyl phosphate (DOCP), di-p-cresyl phosphate (DPCP) and
      diphenyl phosphate (DPHP). The detection frequencies of m-OPFRs ranged from 88.8%
      to 95.4%. BCEP had the highest median concentration (0.93mug/L), followed by
      BCIPP (0.32mug/L), DPHP (0.27mug/L) and DBP (0.20mug/L). Significant correlations
      were found between all pairs of urinary m-OPFRs with correlation coefficients
      ranging from 0.22 to 0.71 (p<0.05). Logistic regression models showed that
      urinary concentrations of BDCIPP (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.25, 95%
      confidential interval [CI]: 1.04-1.50) and DBP (adjusted OR: 1.10, 95% CI:
      1.01-1.20) were positively associated with lower cognitive functions.
      Furthermore, a nonlinear dose-response relationship was found between urinary
      BDCIPP concentration and cognitive decline. To our knowledge, this is the first
      report on OPFR exposure and cognitive impairment among elderly population.
      Further toxicological tests of BDCIPP and DBP are needed to illustrate these
      results.

AB  - Currently, the shortage of phosphorus resources is becoming more and more
      serious. In general, phosphorus fertilizer is poorly utilized in soil and tends
      to gradually accumulate. Freezing-thawing cycles (FT) are seasonal phenomenon
      occurring in high latitudes and altitudes regions, which have obvious influence
      on the form of phosphorus in soil. This study investigates the effect of biochar 
      on soil physicochemical properties, phosphorus form and availability under FT and
      thermostatic incubation (TH) condition. Compared with treatment without biochar, 
      4% biochar addition increased the soil pH value, electrical conductivity, organic
      matter and Olsen-P of soil by a maximum of 0.76, 285.55muS/cm, 28.60g/kg and
      139.27mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, according to Hedley-P classification
      results, under FT condition, the content of labile phosphorus pool is always
      greater than those under TH. FT may promote the conversion of phosphorus from
      other fractions to labile phosphorus pools. Redundancy analysis results show that
      biochar addition and FT can not only directly change the soil phosphorus pool,
      but also alter the soil physicochemical properties and microbial community, which
      further affect the adsorption and mineralization of phosphorus in soil. The
      results of this study will be devoted to understanding the changes in soil
      phosphorus fractions under the effects of biochar addition and FT, providing
      references for agricultural production in areas where FT occur.

AB  - In this study, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at a major industrial park in
      Yangtze River Delta Region, China, along with an urban site had been investigated
      for three years (2018-2020). The daily-mean concentration of total 97 VOCs in the
      industrial park (224.3+/-139.1mug/m(3)) was about twice that of urban site
      (112.0+/-64.2mug/m(3)). Halohydrocarbons were predominant VOCs species at both
      sites accounting for 39.0% and 32.2% in industrial and urban sites, respectively.
      Annual-average concentrations of total VOCs slowed down gradually in industrial
      park, while that of the urban site increased annually. Evident seasonal and
      diurnal variations were observed for VOCs concentration in both sites. Higher
      VOCs concentrations appeared in summer for industrial park, and high
      concentrations generally appeared at 8:00 and 19:00-20:00 in two sites.
      Diagnostic ratios of m/p-xylene to ethylbenzene indicated vehicle emissions and
      solvent volatilization were main sources of VOCs in industrial site during
      winter. Further positive matrix factorization identified fuel usage and industry 
      source as major sources in industrial park and urban site, respectively. Ozone
      formation potential calculations showed aromatics contributed most to ozone
      formation, and benzyl chloride was a key species when its concentration was high.
      Further empirical kinetic modeling approach revealed ozone formation in
      industrial park was in VOCs-limited regime. Through air mass trajectory analysis,
      air pollutants especially ozone from industrial park will be transported to
      stadiums by northeast wind during the 2022 Asian Games. The reductions in VOCs
      emissions from industrials are highly recommended for ozone control in 2022 Asian
      Games.

AB  - The extraction of surface mined bitumen from oil sands deposits in northern
      Alberta, Canada produces large quantities of liquid tailings waste, termed oil
      sands process-affected water (OSPW), which are stored in large tailings ponds.
      OSPW-derived chemicals from several tailings ponds migrating past containment
      structures and through groundwater systems pose a concern for surface water
      contamination. The present study investigated the toxicity of groundwater from
      near-field sites adjacent to a tailings pond with OPSW influence and far-field
      sites with only natural oil sands bitumen influence. The acute toxicity of
      unfractionated groundwater and isolated organic fractions was assessed using a
      suite of aquatic organisms (Pimephales promelas, Oryzias latipes, Daphnia magna, 
      Hyalella azteca, Lampsilis spp., Ceriodaphnia dubia, Hexagenia spp., and Vibrio
      fischeri). Assessment of unfractionated groundwater demonstrated toxicity towards
      all invertebrates in at least one far-field sample, with both near-field and
      far-field samples with bitumen influence toxic towards P. promelas, while no
      toxicity was observed for O. latipes. When assessing the unfractionated
      groundwater and isolated organic fractions from near-field and far-field
      groundwater sites, P. promelas and H. azteca were the most sensitive to organic
      components, while D. magna and L. cardium were most sensitive to the inorganic
      components. Groundwater containing appreciable amounts of dissolved organics
      exhibited similar toxicities to sensitive species regardless of an OSPW or
      natural bitumen source. The lack of a clear distinction in relative acute
      toxicities between near-field and far-field samples indicates that the
      water-soluble chemicals associated with bitumen are acutely toxic to several
      aquatic organisms. This result, combined with the similarities in chemical
      profiles between bitumen-influenced groundwater originating from OSPW and/or
      natural sources, suggests that the industrial bitumen extraction processes
      corresponding to the tailings pond in this study are not contributing unique
      toxic substances to groundwater, relative to natural bitumen compounds present in
      groundwater flow systems.

AB  - The rate of introduction of man-made habitats in coastal environments is growing 
      at an unprecedented pace, as a consequence of the expansion of urban areas.
      Floating installations, due to their unique hydrodynamic features, are able to
      provide great opportunities for enhancing water detoxification through the use of
      sessile, filtering organisms. We assessed whether the application of sponges to
      floating pontoons could function as a tool for biomonitoring organic and
      inorganic pollutants and for improving water quality inside a moderately
      contaminated marina in the NW Mediterranean. Fragments of two common
      Mediterranean sponges (Petrosia (Petrosia) ficiformis and Ircinia oros) were
      fixed to either suspended natural fibre nets beneath a floating pontoon or to
      metal frames deployed on the sea bottom. We assessed the accumulation of organic 
      and inorganic contaminants in sponge fragments and, in order to provide an
      insight into their health status, we examined changes in their metabolic and
      oxidative stress responses and associated microbiomes. Fragments of both sponge
      species filtered out pollutants from seawater on both support types, but
      generally showed a better physiological and metabolic status when fixed to nets
      underneath the pontoon than to bottom frames. P. (P) ficiformis maintained a more
      efficient metabolism and exhibited a lower physiological stress levels and higher
      stability of the associated microbiome in comparison with I. oros. Our study
      suggests that the application of sponges to floating pontoon represents a
      promising nature-based solution to improve the ecological value of urban
      environments.

TI  - Association of country economy and socioeconomic factors on risk factor control
      for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes
      mellitus: Insights from the DISCOVER Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to describe global patterns in achievement of risk factor
      control for primary prevention in patients with T2D and explore the association
      of country's GNI/capita with risk factor control. METHODS: The DISCOVER study is 
      a prospective, observational study of patients with T2D from 38 countries
      enrolled at initiation of second-line glucose-lowering therapy. We examined
      achievement of risk factor control (glycosylated hemoglobin <7%, blood pressure
      <140/90 mmHg, prescription of a statin) at 3 years among those without optimal
      control at baseline. Countries were stratified by gross national income
      (GNI)/capita, from 2017). We examined the impact of country GNI/capita with
      achievement of risk factor control. FINDINGS: Our cohort included 9613 patients
      with T2D and without baseline cardiovascular disease (mean age 57.2 +/- 8.7
      years, 47.9% women). At baseline, 6354/7646 patients (83.1%) had suboptimal
      glucose control, 3449/9200 patients (37.5%) had suboptimal BP control, and
      2800/4221 patients (66.7%) were not on an appropriate statin (sample sizes
      differed due to missing covariate data). Optimal control at 3 years of follow-up 
      was achieved in 41% (glucose), 56% (blood pressure), and 29% (statins) of
      patients. There was significant variability in achievement of risk factor control
      across countries but no association between country GNI/capita with achievement
      of risk factor control (p>0.08 for all). INTERPRETATION: In a global, prospective
      study of patients with T2D, we found that cardiovascular risk factor control
      achievement was suboptimal despite 3 years of follow-up in specialized health
      care systems. Neither country-level nor patient-level socioeconomic factors fully
      explained this finding.

AB  - DNA methylation alters gene expression in numerous biological processes,
      including embryonic development. It is little known about the effect of
      cryopreservation on sperm DNA methylation. The present study has investigated
      whether cryopreservation causes abnormal DNA methylation in cynomolgus macaque
      sperm for five critical genes that includes the maternally imprinted gene
      (SNRPN), genes associated with male infertility (HSPA1L, MTHFR) and genes
      involved in embryonic development (TET3, LZTR1). Our results showed that sperm
      motility, the percentage of acrosomal integrity, DNA integrity and mitochondrial 
      membrane potential were decreased after cryopreservation either being frozen with
      penetrating cryoprotectant, glycerol (Gly) or ethylene glycol (EG), compared to
      fresh sperm (p=0.000), but the methylation patterns of the five target genes from
      cynomolgus macaque sperm samples were not affected after cryopreservation as
      evaluated by the Bisulfite Sequencing PCR (BSP) method. The data indicates that
      the current protocol for sperm cryopreservation of cynomolgus macaque is safe in 
      terms of DNA methylation levels in these genes related to critical sperm
      functions.

AB  - Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder,
      causes motor and cognitive deficits. The main pathophysiologies of DLB are
      glutamate excitotoxicity and accumulation of Lewy bodies comprising
      alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and beta-amyloid (Abeta). Amitriptyline (AMI)
      promotes expression of glutamate transporter-1 and glutamate reuptake. In this
      study, we measured the effects of AMI on behavioral and neuronal function in a
      DLB rat model. We used rivastigmine (RIVA) as a positive control. To establish
      the DLB rat model, male Wistar rats were stereotaxically injected with
      recombinant adenoassociated viral vector with the SNCA gene (10mug/10muL) and
      Abeta (5mug/2.5muL) into the left ventricle and prefrontal cortex, respectively. 
      AMI (10mg/kg/day, i.p.), RIVA (2mg/kg/day, i.p.), or saline was injected
      intraperitoneally after surgery. From the 29(th) day, behavioral tests were
      performed to evaluate the motor and cognitive functions of the rats.
      Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess neuronal changes. We measured the
      alpha-syn level, number of newborn cells, and neuronal density in the hippocampus
      and in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. The DLB group exhibited deficit in 
      object recognition. Both the AMI and RIVA treatments reversed these deficits.
      Histologically, the DLB rats exhibited cell loss in the substantia nigra pars
      compacta and in the hippocampal CA1 area. AMI reduced this cell loss, but RIVA
      did not. In addition, the DLB rats exhibited a lower number of newborn cells and 
      higher alpha-syn levels in the dentate gyrus (DG). AMI did not affect alpha-syn
      accumulation but recovered neurogenesis in the DG of the rats, whereas RIVA
      reversed the alpha-syn accumulation but did not affect neurogenesis in the rats. 
      We suggest that AMI may have potential for use in the treatment of DLB.

TI  - Balloon pulmonary angioplasty versus riociguat in inoperable chronic
      thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (MR BPA): an open-label, randomised
      controlled trial.
LID - S2213-2600(22)00171-0 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment options for patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary 
      hypertension ineligible for pulmonary endarterectomy (inoperable CTEPH) include
      balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) and riociguat. However, these two treatment
      options have not been compared prospectively. We aimed to compare the safety and 
      efficacy of BPA and riociguat in patients with inoperable CTEPH. METHODS: This
      open-label, randomised controlled trial was conducted at four high-volume CTEPH
      centres in Japan. Patients aged 20-80 years with inoperable CTEPH (mean pulmonary
      arterial pressure >/=25 to <60 mm Hg and pulmonary artery wedge pressure </=15 mm
      Hg) and WHO functional class II or III were randomly assigned (1:1) to BPA or
      riociguat via a computer program located at the registration centre using a
      minimisation method with biased-coin assignment. In the BPA group, the aim was
      for BPA to be completed within 4 months of the initial date of the first
      procedure. BPA was repeated until mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased to
      less than 25 mm Hg. The frequency of BPA procedures depended on the difficulty
      and number of the lesions. In the riociguat group, 1.0 mg riociguat was
      administered orally thrice daily. When the systolic blood pressure was maintained
      at 95 mm Hg or higher, the dose was increased by 0.5 mg every 2 weeks up to a
      maximum of 2.5 mg thrice daily; dose adjustment was completed within 4 months of 
      the date of the first dose. The primary endpoint was change in mean pulmonary
      arterial pressure from baseline to 12 months, measured in the full analysis set
      (patients who were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the study treatments,
      and had at least one assessment after randomisation). BPA-related complications
      and indices related to clinical worsening were recorded throughout the study
      period. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study period and evaluated in
      the safety analysis set (patients who were enrolled and randomely assigned to one
      of the study treatments, and had received part of or all the study treatments).
      This trial is registered in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT;
      jRCTs031180239) and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Jan 8, 2016, and Oct 31,
      2019, 61 patients with inoperable CTEPH were enrolled and randomly assigned to
      BPA (n=32) or riociguat (n=29). Patients in the BPA group underwent an average of
      4.7 (SD 1.6) BPA procedures. In the riociguat group, the mean maintenance dose
      was 7.0 (SD 1.0) mg/day at 12 months. At 12 months, mean pulmonary arterial
      pressure had improved by -16.3 (SE 1.6) mm Hg in the BPA group and -7.0 (1.5) mm 
      Hg in the riociguat group (group difference -9.3 mm Hg [95% CI -12.7 to -5.9];
      p<0.0001). A case of clinical worsening of pulmonary hypertension occurred in the
      riociguat group, whereas none occurred in the BPA group. The most common adverse 
      event was haemosputum, haemoptysis, or pulmonary haemorrhage, affecting 14
      patients (44%) in the BPA group and one (4%) in the riociguat group. In 147 BPA
      procedures done in 31 patients, BPA-related complications were observed in 17
      procedures (12%) in eight patients (26%). INTERPRETATION: Compared with
      riociguat, BPA was associated with a greater improvement in mean pulmonary
      arterial pressure in patients with inoperable CTEPH at 12 months, although
      procedure-related complications were reported. These findings support BPA as a
      reasonable option for inoperable CTEPH in centres with experienced BPA operators,
      with attention to procedure-related complications. FUNDING: Bayer Yakuhin.

TI  - Balloon pulmonary angioplasty versus riociguat for the treatment of inoperable
      chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (RACE): a multicentre, phase 3,
      open-label, randomised controlled trial and ancillary follow-up study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Riociguat and balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) are treatment
      options for inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).
      However, randomised controlled trials comparing these treatments are lacking. We 
      aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BPA versus riociguat in patients
      with inoperable CTEPH. METHODS: In this phase 3, multicentre, open-label,
      parallel-group, randomised controlled trial done in 23 French centres of
      expertise for pulmonary hypertension, we enrolled treatment-naive patients aged
      18-80 years with newly diagnosed, inoperable CTEPH and pulmonary vascular
      resistance of more than 320 dyn.s/cm(5). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to
      BPA or riociguat via a web-based randomisation system, with block randomisation
      (block sizes of two or four patients) without stratification. The primary
      endpoint was change in pulmonary vascular resistance at week 26, expressed as
      percentage of baseline pulmonary vascular resistance in the intention-to-treat
      population. Safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one
      dose of riociguat or had at least one BPA session. Patients who completed the
      RACE trial continued into an ancillary 26-week follow-up during which symptomatic
      patients with pulmonary vascular resistance of more than 320 dyn.s/cm(5)
      benefited from add-on riociguat after BPA or add-on BPA after riociguat. This
      trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02634203, and is completed.
      FINDINGS: Between Jan 19, 2016, and Jan 18, 2019, 105 patients were randomly
      assigned to riociguat (n=53) or BPA (n=52). At week 26, the geometric mean
      pulmonary vascular resistance decreased to 39.9% (95% CI 36.2-44.0) of baseline
      pulmonary vascular resistance in the BPA group and 66.7% (60.5-73.5) of baseline 
      pulmonary vascular resistance in the riociguat group (ratio of geometric means
      0.60, 95% CI 0.52-0.69; p<0.0001). Treatment-related serious adverse events
      occurred in 22 (42%) of 52 patients in the BPA group and five (9%) of 53 patients
      in the riociguat group. The most frequent treatment-related serious adverse
      events were lung injury (18 [35%] of 52 patients) in the BPA group and severe
      hypotension with syncope (two [4%] of 53 patients) in the riociguat group. There 
      were no treatment-related deaths. At week 52, a similar reduction in pulmonary
      vascular resistance was observed in patients treated with first-line riociguat or
      first-line BPA (ratio of geometric means 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-1.04). The incidence
      of BPA-related serious adverse events was lower in patients who were pretreated
      with riociguat (five [14%] of 36 patients vs 22 [42%] of 52 patients).
      INTERPRETATION: At week 26, pulmonary vascular resistance reduction was more
      pronounced with BPA than with riociguat, but treatment-related serious adverse
      events were more common with BPA. The finding of fewer BPA-related serious
      adverse events among patients who were pretreated with riociguat in the follow-up
      study compared with those who received BPA as first-line treatment points to the 
      potential benefits of a multimodality approach to treatment in patients with
      inoperable CTEPH. Further studies are needed to explore the effects of sequential
      treatment combining one or two medications and BPA in patients with inoperable
      CTEPH. FUNDING: Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique of the French

TI  - Knowledge and Attitude of Fathers towards Childhood Vaccination in Ogun State,
      Nigeria: A Comparative Study.
PG  - 747-755
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - ACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) have been shown to
      account for one-fifth of deaths among under-fives. Father's knowledge and
      attitude greatly influence the approval and uptake of childhood vaccination in
      patriarchal communities. This study aimed to assess and compare fathers'
      knowledge and attitude to childhood vaccination in urban and rural communities of
      Ogun State, Nigeria. METHODS: Four hundred and forty men each were interviewed in
      rural and urban areas. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to
      elicit data which were analyzed with IBM SPSS version 20. Mean ages of
      respondents were compared using T-test while chisquare was used in testing
      association between categorical variables. Results were presented in tables and P
      < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There was no
      statistically significant difference in the mean ages of residents in the urban
      and rural areas (t = -1.82, p= 0.07). A greater proportion of rural participants 
      (51.4%) had an overall good knowledge of childhood vaccination as against 45.2%
      of urban men but this difference was not statistically significant with p =
      0.069. A greater percentage of participants in the urban area (58.0%) had an
      overall positive attitude to male participation in childhood vaccination compared
      to 54.1% of rural men. However, this difference was not statistically significant
      (p= 0.204). CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATION: There was better knowledge of childhood
      vaccination among rural participants. In contrast, attitude towards childhood
      vaccination was better among urban residents. There is a need for educational
      interventions that may positively influence the attitude of men towards childhood
      vaccinations, particularly in rural areas to be conducted by the government,
      health workers, and other stakeholders through various communication media and
      adopting diverse health education methods.

      disciplines. Especially given the need for consistent treatment and follow-up of 
      nAMD patients, this can have far-reaching consequences for visual function,
      especially in elderly patients. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of nAMD
      patients, the number of visits (IVI or follow-up), OCTs or IVIs performed and the
      mean worst visual acuity for the period before and after the first COVID
      19-associated lockdown were compared in a portal-based collaboration of 50 eye
      care practices. Patients were treated according to the pro re nata (PRN) regimen 
      that included intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors based on activity
      criteria in the OCT follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 34,660 visits from 55 months
      were included in the analysis. Before lockdown (16 March 2020), an average of
      81.8% +/- 2.1% of patients were regularly checked or treated (every 4 to 5
      weeks). With the onset of lockdown, the proportion of patients receiving optimum 
      treatment dropped to 64.0%. Initially, the proportion of OCT follow-ups decreased
      from 48.4% to 30.9% and, with a delay, the proportion of injections decreased
      from 57.5% to 45.8%. This was also reflected in the number of OCT follow-ups:
      15.5 before, 11.4 during and 17.2 after lockdown (p < 0.001). In 29% of cases, an
      individual worsening of visual acuity by more than 0.1 logMAR after the end of
      the lockdown compared to before the lockdown could be observed. On average, mean 
      visual acuity decreased significantly by 0.054 logMAR (p < 10(-11)). This
      significant impairment was not reversed again during the remaining observation
      period, although the number of visits, OCT examinations and IVIs in the following
      12 months were at the pre-lockdown level. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic-related
      lockdown resulted in unintended treatment breaks in nAMD patients receiving IVI
      therapy. The decrease in visits as well as in IVIs caused a loss of visual
      function in the observed cohort. The consistent treatment regimen of nAMD
      patients was resumed shortly after the lockdown with an immediate normalization
      of the number of OCT examinations and IVIs. However, a permanent loss of visual
      function was observed, and this did not improve within a year after the lockdown.
      This finding highlights the importance of better case management, leading to
      improved patient adherence in the event of further waves of COVID or other
      pandemics.

LID - 10.1055/a-1885-4053 [doi]
AB  - We aimed to identify potential physiological and performance differences of
      trained cross-country skiers (V o2max=60+/-4 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) following two,
      3-week long altitude modalities: 1) training at moderate altitudes (600-1700 m)
      and living at 1500 m (LMTM;N=8); and 2) training at moderate altitudes (600-1700 
      m) and living at 1500 m with additional nocturnal normobaric hypoxic exposures
      (FiO2 =0.17;LHTM; N=8). All participants conducted the same training throughout
      the altitude training phase and underwent maximal roller ski trials and
      submaximal cyclo-ergometery before, during and one week after the training camps.
      No exercise performance or hematological differences were observed between the
      two modalities. The average roller ski velocities were increased one week after
      the training camps following both LMTM (p=0.03) and LHTM (p=0.04) with no
      difference between the two (p=0.68). During the submaximal test, LMTM increased
      the Tissue Oxygenation Index (11.5+/-6.5 to 1.0+/-8.5%; p=0.04), decreased the
      total hemoglobin concentration (15.1+/-6.5 to 1.7+/-12.9 a.u.;p=0.02), and
      increased blood pH (7.36+/-0.03 to 7.39+/-0.03;p=0.03). On the other hand, LHTM
      augmented minute ventilation (76+/-14 to 88+/-10 l.min(-1);p=0.04) and systemic
      blood oxygen saturation by 2+/-1%; (p=0.02) with no such differences observed
      following the LMTM. Collectively, despite minor physiological differences
      observed between the two tested altitude training modalities both induced
      comparable exercise performance modulation.

TI  - Pancreatic Elastography Predicts Endoscopic Secretin-Pancreatic Function Test
      Result in Patients With Early Changes of Chronic Pancreatitis: A Prospective,
      Cross-Sectional, Observational Study.
PG  - 1264-1268
LID - 10.14309/ajg.0000000000001846 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The endoscopic pancreatic function test (ePFT) has been proposed
      for the evaluation of patients with suspected early chronic pancreatitis (CP) in 
      the appropriate clinical context, but the cost and duration of the test limit its
      clinical applicability. Pancreatic secretion decreases as pancreatic fibrosis
      develops in CP. Pancreatic fibrosis can be quantified by endoscopic
      ultrasound-elastography (EUS-E). We aim at evaluating whether EUS-E correlates
      with and could replace ePFT for the evaluation of patients with suspected CP.
      METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional, and observational study of patients with
      clinical suspicion of CP and inconclusive EUS findings was conducted. EUS-E and
      ePFT were performed. Diagnosis of CP was supported if the ePFT result
      (bicarbonate peak) was abnormally low (<80 mEq/L). Correlation between EUS-E
      (strain ratio [SR]) and ePFT results was analyzed by linear regression.
      Diagnostic accuracy of EUS-E for CP was calculated using ePFT as a reference
      method. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were included and analyzed. The mean peak
      bicarbonate concentration at the ePFT was 63.8 +/- 23.6 mEq/L, and it was
      abnormally low in 50 patients (82.0%). The mean SR was 3.85 +/- 1.24. Correlation
      between SR and bicarbonate secretion was highly significant (r = 0.715, P <
      0.0001). Diagnostic accuracy of EUS-E for CP was 93.4%. DISCUSSION: The degree of
      pancreatic fibrosis as evaluated by EUS-E correlates significantly with the
      secretin-stimulated pancreatic secretion of bicarbonate in patients with clinical
      suspicion of CP and inconclusive EUS findings of the disease. EUS-E could replace
      ePFT for the evaluation of these patients in clinical practice.

TI  - Clinical and molecular findings of intermediate allele carriers in the HTT gene
      from the Mexican Mestizo population.
LID - 10.1159/000526260 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are reports of different clinical statuses in carriers of
      intermediate alleles (IAs) of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene, from
      individuals affected by a clinical picture indistinguishable from Huntington's
      disease (HD) to those without manifestations. Therefore, the possible clinical
      significance of these alleles has been widely debated. OBJECTIVES: To describe
      general and clinical features and discard HD phenocopies by molecular assessment 
      in a case series of IA carriers on the HTT gene of a laboratory sample from a
      neurological center in Mexico. METHODS: We selected individuals who had
      previously been tested for the HTT gene expansion, which resulted in IAs.
      Clinical information was obtained from medical records, and molecular analysis of
      the JPH3, PRNP, and TBP genes was performed only in IA carriers with clinical
      manifestations. In addition, two patients with IA and acanthocytes were evaluated
      by whole-exome sequencing (WES). The scientific and ethical committees of the
      National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery Manuel Velasco Suarez (NINNMVS) 
      approved this study. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2019, the Genetics Department of the
      NINNMVS confirmed 34 individuals with IAs, 15 of whom belonged to 11 families
      with HD (IA-HD) and 19 of whom had no family history of HD (IA-non-HD). We found 
      a high proportion of manifestations of the HD phenotypic spectrum in the
      IA-non-HD subgroup. In addition, among the 20 samples of IA carriers with
      manifestations molecularly evaluated, we identified two unrelated subjects with
      CAG/CTG repeat expansions on the JPH3 gene confirming Huntington's disease-like 2
      (HDL2) and one patient with the homozygous pathogenic c.3232G>T variant
      (p.Glu1078Ter) in the VPS13A gene, demonstrating choreoacanthocytosis.
      DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our results show the most extensive series of subjects
      with IAs and clinical manifestations. In addition, we identify three HD
      phenocopies, two HDL2 cases, and one choreoacanthocytosis case. Therefore, we
      emphasize evaluating other HD phenocopies in IA carriers with clinical
      manifestations whose family background is not associated with HD.

TI  - Inflammation and epigenetic ageing are largely independent markers of biological 
      ageing and mortality.
LID - glac147 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glac147 [doi]
AB  - Limited evidence exists on the link between inflammation and epigenetic ageing.
      We aimed to 1) assess the cross-sectional and prospective associations of 22
      inflammation-related plasma markers and a signature of inflammaging with
      epigenetic ageing; 2) determine whether epigenetic ageing and inflammaging are
      independently associated with mortality. Blood samples from 940 participants in
      the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, collected at baseline (1990-1994) and
      follow-up (2003-2007) were assayed for DNA methylation and 22
      inflammation-related markers, including well-established markers (e.g.,
      interleukins and C-reactive protein) and metabolites of the tryptophan-kynurenine
      pathway. Four measures of epigenetic ageing (PhenoAge, GrimAge, DunedinPoAm and
      Zhang) and a signature of inflammaging were considered, adjusted for age, and
      transformed to Z-scores. Associations were assessed using linear regression, and 
      mortality hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated 
      using Cox regression. Cross-sectionally, most inflammation-related markers were
      associated with epigenetic ageing measures, although with generally modest effect
      sizes (regression coefficients per SD</=0.26) and explaining altogether between
      1% and 11% of their variation. Prospectively, baseline inflammation-related
      markers were not, or only weakly, associated with epigenetic ageing after 11
      years of follow-up. Epigenetic ageing and inflammaging were strongly and
      independently associated with mortality, e.g. inflammaging: HR=1.41,
      95%CI=1.27-1.56, P=2x10-10; which was only slightly attenuated after adjustment
      for four epigenetic ageing measures: HR=1.35, 95%CI=1.22-1.51, P=7x10-9).
      Although cross-sectionally associated with epigenetic ageing,
      inflammation-related markers accounted for a modest proportion of its variation. 
      Inflammaging and epigenetic ageing are essentially non-overlapping markers of
      biological ageing and may be used jointly to predict mortality.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crystalline lens is the major dioptric component and varies with
      refractive status. In this study, we aim to evaluate the changes of dimensions
      and functions of crystalline lens in high myopia and its correlated variables
      using CASIA2 swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). METHODS: One
      hundred and thirty eligible eyes of myopic patients from 18-40 years old were
      enrolled and divided into low-to-moderate myopia (LMM) and high myopia (HM)
      groups according to spherical equivalent (SE). Anterior segment features,
      including lens thickness (LT), anterior radius of curvature (ARC), posterior
      radius of curvature (PRC), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and lens tilt were
      obtained by CASIA2. Lens power was calculated using Bennett's formula.
      Sixty-seven participants were imaged at static state and accommodative state
      induced by -3 diopter (D) stimulus. RESULTS: Compared to LMM group, HM group
      exhibited a significantly reduction in LT, ARC and lens tilt (all P<0.01). Each
      parameter correlated positively with SE (all P<0.01). Lens power increased with
      LT and tilt (r=0.42, 0.45), but decreased with ARC and axial length (AL)
      (r=-0.37, -0.62) among highly myopic eyes. Multivariate regression analysis
      revealed that lower lens power appeared to be independently associated with axial
      elongation in both groups (LMM: beta=-1.124, P=0.002; HM: beta=-1.603, P<0.001,
      respectively). Decreases in ARC and ACD were accompanied by accommodative
      response in each group, while PRC reduced during accommodation (P=0.009) only in 
      high myopia. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with high myopia presented the thinner
      thickness, smaller tilt, less lens power and higher accommodative response. Lens 
      shape was closely associated with SE, however AL was a meaningful indicator of
      lens power.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Upper limb elevation begins with core stabilization, but the effects 
      of core stability on shoulder and spine kinematics are unknown. Sex differences
      also exist in shoulder kinematics and core stability. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the
      effects of core stability on shoulder and spine kinematics during upper limb
      elevation by taking sex into account. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: The
      Sahrmann Core Stability Test, lumbar spine motor control test battery, and Y
      Balance Test (lower and upper quarters) were performed in 50 healthy young
      adults. For each test, a principal component (PC) analysis was conducted
      according to sex; the overall core stability score was calculated. The top and
      bottom third of the PC scores were defined as high and low score groups,
      respectively (each group: nine males and eight females). Shoulder and spine
      kinematics during upper limb elevation were compared separately for males and
      females. RESULTS: Spinal extension was greater in the low score group by a
      maximum of 1.9 degrees in males (P < .001; eta(2) = 0.068) and 1.6 degrees in
      females (P < .001; eta(2) = 0.141). In the low score group of females, the
      scapular posterior tilt was a maximum of 5.6 degrees smaller (P < .001; eta(2) = 
      0.221) and glenohumeral elevation was a maximum of 4.5 degrees larger (P < .001; 
      eta(2) = 0.113) than the high score group of females. CONCLUSION: Core stability 
      affected spine and female scapular and glenohumeral kinematics during upper limb 
      elevation. Core stability may be one of the potential contributors to shoulder
      kinematics, particularly in females.

TI  - The anterior segment biometrics in high myopia eyes.
LID - 10.1159/000526280 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To investigate and compare the anterior segment biometrics in high 
      myopia and control groups. METHODS: Thirty-four eyes of 34 high myopia patients
      and 42 eyes of 42 control subjects were included. The Schlemm's canal (SC) area, 
      trabecular meshwork (TM) thickness and length, scleral spur (SS) length and
      anterior scleral thickness (AST) were measured using swept-source optical
      coherence tomography. Associations between SC area, TM thickness, TM length, SS
      length and AST were also estimated. RESULTS: SC area, TM thickness and SS length 
      were significantly associated with AST0 (AST at 0mm from SS) in both high myopia 
      and control groups. AST0 (702.61+/-78.05 vs. 729.12+/-95.87 mum, p=0.085) and SS 
      length (206.25+/-52.25 vs. 212.09+/-51.86 mum, p=0.556) were not significantly
      different between high myopia and control groups, whereas SC area
      (6622.68+/-1130.06 vs. 6105.85+/-1297.84 mum2, p=0.015) was significantly greater
      and TM thickness (96.15+/-34.40 vs. 107.93+/-29.97 mum, p=0.048) was
      significantly thinner in high myopia group than in control group. CONCLUSION: SC 
      area and TM thickness were significantly associated with AST0, while AST0 and SS 
      length were not significantly different between high myopia and control groups.
      The changes in SC and TM dimensions in high myopia eyes might be caused by
      factors other than AST0 and SS length.

AB  - Large-scale coal mining activities on the QTP have affected the natural grassland
      ecosystem which will take decades to recover. Therefore, looking for an effective
      vegetation restoration method is the most effective way to restore the ecosystem.
      In this study, we explored the effects of three vegetation restoration modes
      (coal mine spoils planting (CK), organic fertilizer planting (OF), and cover soil
      planting (CS)) on the five cold-resistance related physiological indices of three
      native Gramineae plants (Elymus nutans, Poa crymophila and Festuca sinensis)
      growing in three different habitats (shady slope, sunny slope, and flat slope).
      The higher contents of soluble sugar (SS) in the Elymus nutans (213.46 mg/g) and 
      Festuca sinensis (202.84 mg/g) were recorded under the CS treatment in the sunny 
      slope habitat. The FP contents of Elymus nutans (421.31 mug/g), Poa crymophila
      (310.06 mug/g), and Festuca sinens (288.45 mug/g) were higher under the CK
      treatment in the flat ground habitat. The higher (P < 0.05) content of
      chlorophyll (Chl) was recorded in the Elymus nutans (2.13 mg/g) under the CS
      treatment in the sunny slope habitat compared to the other two plants. We
      observed lower MDA contents in the Elymus nutans (3.19 nmol/g) and Festuca
      sinensis (3.56 nmol/g) under the CK treatment growing in the shady slope habitat.
      In the shady slope habitat, the H2O2 contents of Elymus nutans (15.86 mumol/g),
      Poa crymophila (6.78 mumol/g), and Festuca sinensis (8.76 mumol/g) under the CS
      treatment were significantly lower compared to other treatments. Based on
      membership function method, the low-temperature adaptability order of the three
      restoration plants from strong to weak was Elymus nutans > Festuca sinensis > Poa
      crymophila. While the effectiveness order of the three vegetation restoration
      models in alpine mining areas from good to bad was CS > OF > CK. This study will 
      provide a theoretical and guiding significance to evaluate the effectiveness of
      different restoration methods, formulate optimal restoration strategies and guide
      the sustainable restoration of the damaged ecosystems of the alpine mining areas.

TI  - Motor unit distribution and recruitment in spastic and non-spastic bilateral
      biceps brachii muscles of chronic stroke survivors.
LID - 10.1088/1741-2552/ac86f4 [doi]
AB  - Objective- This study aims to characterize the motor units distribution and
      recruitment pattern in the spastic and non-spastic bilateral biceps brachii
      muscles (BBMs) of chronic stroke survivors. Approach- High-density surface
      electromyography (HD-sEMG) signals were collected from both spastic and
      non-spastic BBMs of fourteen chronic stroke subjects during isometric elbow
      flexion at 10%, 30%, 50% and 100% maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). By
      combining HD-sEMG decomposition and bioelectrical source imaging, motor unit
      innervation zones (MUIZs) of the decomposed motor units were first localized in
      the 3D space of spastic and non-spastic BBMs. The motor unit depth defined as the
      distance between the localized MUIZ and its normal projection on the skin surface
      was then normalized to the arm radius of each subject and averaged at given
      contraction level. The averaged MU depth at different contraction levels on a
      specific arm side (intra-side) and the bilateral depths under a specific
      contraction level (inter-side) were compared. Main Results- The average depth of 
      decomposed MUs increased with the contraction force and significant differences
      observed between 10% vs 50% (p < 0.0001), 10% vs 100% (p < 0.0001) and 30% vs
      100% MVC (p = 0.0017) on the non-spastic side, indicating that larger MUs with
      higher recruitment threshold locate in deeper muscle regions. In contrast, no
      force-related difference in MU depth was observed on the spastic side, suggesting
      a disruption of orderly recruitment of MUs with increase of force level, or the
      MU denervation and the subsequent collateral reinnervation secondary to upper
      motor neuron lesions. Inter-side comparison demonstrated significant MU depth
      difference at 10% (p=0.0048) and 100% force effort (p=0.0026). Significance-This 
      study represents the first effort to non-invasively characterize the MU
      distribution inside spastic and non-spastic bilateral BBM of chronic stroke
      patients by combining HD-sEMG recording, EMG signal decomposition and
      bioelectrical source imaging. The findings of this study advances our
      understanding regarding the neurophysiology of human muscles and the
      neuromuscular alterations following stroke. It may also offer important MU depth 
      information for botulinum toxin (BoNT) injection in clinical post-stroke
      spasticity management.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) is a common
      complication of type 2 diabetes. The unrelenting pain associated with PDPN
      adversely affects a patient's quality of life. Recognizing the crucial role that 
      sleep plays in the metabolic control of diabetes, this study aims to estimate the
      prevalence of sleep impairment in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN)
      and identify the factors associated with it. METHODS: We conducted a
      cross-sectional study among 156 patients in a tertiary care hospital in south
      India. We recruited consenting adults with PDPN. Sleep quality was analyzed using
      the Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI), a self-rating scale. Hba1c served as a 
      measure of glycemic control. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the
      hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale. Data were analyzed in SPSS 26.0.
      RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were included in the study with a mean age of
      58.39 +/- 9.12 years. In 151 (96.79%) patients demonstrated sleep impairment with
      a global PSQI score of 10.92 +/- 2.87. Female sex, ischemic heart disease (IHD), 
      high anxiety levels and use of insulin, pregabapentin, and duloxetine; were
      significantly associated with poor sleep quality (p < 0.05). The median Hba1c was
      high (9% [7.46-11.1]). However, there was no statistical correlation between the 
      degree of sleep impairment and glycemic control. CONCLUSION: We found a high
      prevalence of sleep impairment in patients with PDPN. Female sex, IHD, high
      anxiety levels and use of neuropathic drugs were predictors of poor sleep
      quality.

AB  - Eight 2r,6c-diaryl-3t-methylpiperidin-4-one arylsulphonylhydrazones 4(a-d) and
      5(a-d) was synthesized by the condensation of benzenesulphonylhydrazide (2) or
      p-toluenesulphonylhydrazide (3) with 2r,6c-diaryl-3t-methylpiperidin-4-ones
      1(a-d). The structural and molecular confirmations of the synthesized hydrazones 
      were interpreted using 1D, 2D NMR spectra and CHNS analysis. The in silico
      studies of synthesized compounds 4(a-d) and 5(a-d) against
      b-ketoacyl-ACP-synthase III (FabH) indicated excellent anti-tubercular efficacy. 
      The hydrazones were evaluated for antimicrobial activity and it was found that
      they exhibited significant antimicrobial activities. The in vitro evaluation of
      the compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv indicated that 4b and 5b
      had high inhibitory efficiency at the lowest concentration of 3.13 and 6.25
      mug/ml, respectively. Hence our novel compounds can be used as an alternative
      drug against tuberculosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a spreading addictive behaviour in recent years, internet gaming
      disorder (IGD) has been studied a lot and the overall research results indicate
      that IGD has a high prevalence among adolescents and young adults (AYAs). To
      update the status quo of prevalence, it is necessary to conduct comprehensive
      analyses. METHODS: On the premise of following the PRISMA statement, the study
      conducted two systematic reviews and meta-analyses to assess the global
      prevalence of IGD among AYAs and identify its possible risk factors. To achieve
      the goals, PubMed and CNKI databases were used to select the concerned studies
      published up to May 31, 2021. Heterogeneity was assessed using a funnel plot,
      Begg's test, Egger's test, and trim-and-fil method, followed by sensitivity
      analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression analysis. RESULTS: For the
      meta-analysis of prevalence, 407,620 participants from 155 reports in 33
      countries were included. The pooled prevalence of IGD among AYAs was 9.9% (95%
      CI: 8.6%-11.3%, P = 0.000, I(2) = 94.4%), including 8.8% (95% CI: 7.5%-10.0%)
      among adolescents and 10.4% (95% CI: 8.8%-11.9%) among young adults. The
      following 12 factors are the possible risk factors of IGD among AYAs, which are
      stress, long average game time, family dysfunction, poor academic performance,
      being bullied, bullying, interpersonal problems, hyperactivity/inattention,
      anxiety, depression, emotional distress and low self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study confirms the prevalence and possible risk factors for IGD among AYAs. It's 
      valuable in understanding the threat of IGD and finding intervention strategies
      for IGD among AYAs.

AB  - Ultrasound-assisted probiotic fermentation suspension treatment under mild heat
      was applied to freshly cut lotus root. Combined treatment significantly (p <
      0.05) improved the bactericidal effect: S. aureus, E. coli O157:H7, A. flavus
      spores, and yeast were completely killed at 55 for 6 min, morphological and
      structural changes of cells were observed. Combined treatment inhibited enzymatic
      browning via decreasing the activities of PPO, POD, PAL, and decreasing TPC,
      soluble quinone content. The decrease of external resistance, capacitance and the
      increase of internal resistance reflected the loss of structural integrity of
      cells after combined treatment. For combined treatment samples, no obvious color 
      change was observed during 12 days of storage but weight loss rate, total acid
      increased significantly (p < 0.05) and hardness decreased, the shelf life was
      extended to 12 d. Ultrasound-assisted probiotic fermentation suspension treatment
      under mild heat had the dual effects of sterilization and inhibition of browning.

AB  - The goal of this study was to develop dry heat processing conditions that could
      achieve a >5-log reduction of Salmonella with minimal negative impact on almond
      quality. The effects of almond's water activity (aw) levels and packaging methods
      on Salmonella inactivation by dry heat were determined. Almonds were
      dip-inoculated in a four-strain Salmonella cocktail and conditioned to aw of
      0.43, 0.33, 0.23, and 0.20. The inoculated almonds were then placed in
      vacuum-sealed mylar bags (vacuum packaging), ambient-sealed glass tubes
      (non-vacuum packaging), and petri dishes without covers (no packaging). The
      packaged and un-packaged almonds were treated by dry heat with 13 % relative
      humidity at 73 degrees C. Vacuum packaging in general achieved slightly better
      (in some cases significantly better (p < 0.05)) or similar inactivation effect on
      Salmonella than non-vacuum packaging. Both vacuum and non-vacuum packaging
      methods achieved much greater Salmonella inactivation than the no packaging
      method. For example, a 4-h treatment at 73 degrees C reduced Salmonella on
      almonds with aw of 0.43 by 5.1-, 4.4-, and 1.3-log for mylar bag, tube, and petri
      dish, respectively. Higher aw levels resulted in better inactivation of
      Salmonella. To achieve a >4-log reduction of Salmonella on almonds packaged in
      mylar bags, 3-, 6-, 8-, and 8-h of heat treatment were needed for almonds with aw
      values of 0.43, 0.33, 0.23 and 0.20, respectively. Vacuum packaging in
      combination with a 4-h heat treatment of almonds with initial aw of 0.43 or 8-h
      heat treatment of almonds with initial aw of 0.33 could achieved a >/=5-log
      reduction of Salmonella. Those two combinations resulted in very little weight
      loss (</=0.05 %), insignificant color change (E </= 1.26), and unnoticeable
      change in visual appearance of almonds, demonstrating that they could be
      potentially used for raw almond pasteurization.

AB  - Acrylamide is widely present in many fried and baked foods, that has been proved 
      as potentially carcinogenic to humans. In this work, a novel biosensor using
      core-shell upconversion nanoparticles (CSUCNPs) with aptamer as recognized
      element was designed for the determination of acrylamide. The principle of this
      work was based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process from 
      CSUCNPs to silver nanoclusters (AgNCs). Whereas the binding between acrylamide
      and the aptamer disturbed the DNA structure and inhibited the synthesis of AgNCs,
      which induced a higher fluorescence intensity. Under the optimal conditions, a
      low limit of detection (LOD) was calculated as 1.13 nM in the range of 1-10(5)
      nM. This biosensor was further applied in the spiked food samples to validate the
      applicability that recoveries were at the range of 78.52-117.09% with a relative 
      standard deviation of 1.54-10.46%. The approach was compared with the standard
      HPLC method in great agreement (P 0.05).

      rats by alleviating secondary brain injury via anti-excitotoxicity pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary brain injury (SBI) has been confirmed as a leading cause
      for the poor prognosis of patients suffering from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
      SBI co-exists in ischemia and hemorrhagic stroke. Neuro-excitotoxicity is
      considered the initiating factor of ICH-induced SBI. Our previous research has
      revealed alpha-asarone (ASA)'s efficacy against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
      stroke by mitigating neuro-excitotoxicity. It is not yet known if ASA exhibit
      neuroprotection against ICH. PURPOSE: This work aimed to investigate ASA's
      therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of action against ICH in a classic
      rat model induced by collagenase injection. METHODS: An in vivo ICH model of
      Sprague-Dawley rats was established by collagenase injection. We administrated
      different ASA doses (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg, i.p.) at 2 h post-ICH. Then, rats'
      short- and long-term neurobehavioral function, bodyweight change, and learning
      and memory ability were blindly evaluated. Histological, Nissl, and flow
      cytometry were applied to assess the neuronal damage post-ICH. The wet/dry method
      and Evans blue extravasation estimated brain edema and blood-brain barrier
      function. Pathway-related proteins were investigated by immunofluorescence
      staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western-blot analysis. RESULTS: 
      The results demonstrated that ASA ameliorated neurological deterioration,
      bodyweight loss, and learning and memory ability of ICH rats. Histological,
      Nissl, and flow cytometry analyses showed that ASA reduced neuronal damage and
      apoptosis post-ICH. Besides, ASA probably mitigated brain edema and blood-brain
      barrier dysfunction via inhibiting astrocyte activation and consequent
      pro-inflammatory response. The mechanism investigation attributed ASA's efficacy 
      to the following aspects: 1) promoting sodium ion excretion, thus blocking
      excitatory signal transduction along the axon; 2) preventing glutamate-involved
      pathways, i.e., decrease of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor subunit 2B,
      increase of glutamate transporter-1, and alleviation of calcium-related cascades,
      mitochondrion-associated apoptosis, and neuronal autophagy; 3) enhancing the
      expression of GABAARs, thus abating neuronal excitotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Our
      study first confirmed the effect of ASA on ameliorating the neurobehavioral
      deterioration of ICH rats, possibly via alleviation of glutamate-involved
      neuro-excitotoxicity, i.e., calcium cascades, mitochondrion-involved apoptosis,
      neuronal autophagy, and astrocyte-related inflammation. These findings not only
      provided a promising drug candidate for clinical treatment of ICH but also shed
      light on the future drug discovery against ICH.

TI  - Sleep Quality in a Nigerian Community: Prevalence of Poor Sleep Quality, Risk
      Factors and Health-Related Quality of Life.
PG  - 729-736
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A review of the literature shows there is a dearth of community-based
      studies that evaluated the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its psychosocial 
      correlates among Nigerians. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence 
      of poor sleep quality and its psychosocial correlates in a Nigerian community.
      METHODS: The data presented here is an extract from the IlisanRemo Functional
      Bowel Disorder Project, a cross-sectional community-based study of 515 adults
      aged 18-70 years. The aspects of the research instrument relevant to this study
      include the sociodemographic data, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Beck
      Anxiety and Depression Inventories, and Short Form 12, version 2 Health Survey
      (SF-12v2) questionnaire. An overall PSQI score of >5 was defined as poor sleep
      quality. Data analysis was conducted with appropriate statistical instruments.
      P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: There were adequate data for 
      statistical analysis for 505 participants. The participants' mean age was
      32.73+/-12.93 years. A total of 212 (42.0%) participants had poor sleep quality. 
      Poor sleep quality was associated with attainment of at least secondary
      schooleducation [AOR = 2.27 (95% CI, 1.17 - 4.41), p = 0.016], increased waist
      circumference [AOR = 1.03 (95% CI, 1.01 - 1.04), p < 0.001], coffee consumption
      [AOR = 2.57 (95% CI, 1.66 - 3.99), p < 0.001], anxiety [AOR = 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03 
      - 1.09), p < 0.001], and depression [AOR = 1.05 (95% CI, 1.03 - 1.08), p <
      0.001]. Participants with poor sleep quality had poorer mean SF-12v2 sub-scales
      scores compared with those with good sleep quality in Bodily Pain, General
      Health, Vitality and Mental Health with statistical significance (p < 0.001).
      CONCLUSION: Poor sleep quality is common in our study population and needs to be 
      holistically addressed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica 
      (GCA/PMR) represent independent risk factors for worse outcomes in COVID-19.
      METHODS: Observational, national, French, multicenter cohort (NCT04353609)
      comprising patients aged >/=18 years with confirmed diagnoses of either GCA, PMR 
      or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) having presented COVID-19; those under rituximab
      were excluded. Primary endpoint was COVID-19 severity in GCA/PMR patients as
      compared to RA. We also aimed to describe the evolution of GCA/PMR patients
      following COVID-19. Multinomial logistic regression models were performed, with
      and without adjustment on pre-specified confounding factors (i.e., age, sex, body
      mass index, arterial hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease).
      Unadjusted and adjusted multinomial odds-ratio (OR/aOR) and their 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) were calculated as effect size using RA as reference group.
      RESULTS: Between April 15, 2020, and August 20, 2021, 674 patients [45 (6.6%)
      GCA, 47 (7.0%) PMR, 582 (86.4%) RA; 62.8 years, 73.2% female] were included.
      Compared to RA patients, those with GCA/PMR were older and more frequently
      presented hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Severe COVID-19 and 
      death occurred in 24 (26.1%) and 16 (17.8%) patients with GCA/PMR, respectively. 
      Unadjusted analyses revealed higher odds of severe COVID-19 [OR = 3.32 (95% CI
      1.89-5.83; p < 0.001)] and death [OR = 3.20 (95%CI 1.67-6.13; p < 0.001)] for
      GCA/PMR compared to RA. After model adjustment, these odds were attenuated.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with GCA/PMR were more likely to have severe COVID-19 and
      higher mortality compared to those with RA. This worse prognosis is mostly due to
      well known risk factors for the general population rather than vasculitis per se.

AB  - PVR/TIGIT and PD-L1/PD-1 axes play essential roles in tumor immune evasion and
      could be potential targets for combined immunotherapy. We aimed to evaluate the
      expression status of the above-mentioned immune markers in lung squamous cell
      carcinoma (LUSC), and investigate their survival impact and relevance with the
      immune microenvironment and clinicopathological features. We retrospectively
      collected specimens from 190 LUSC patients, who underwent pulmonary surgeries,
      and we performed immunohistochemistry assays of PVR, TIGIT, PD-L1, PD-1 and CD8. 
      In our cohort, the positive rate of PVR was 85.8%, which was much higher than the
      positive rate of PD-L1 at 26.8%. A total of 32 (16.8%) patients demonstrated
      co-expression of PVR/PD-L1. High TIGIT density was correlated with positive PD-L1
      expression, high PD-1 density, and high CD8 density (PD-L1, P=0.033; PD-1,
      P<0.001; CD8, P<0.001), and positive PVR expression was correlated with positive 
      PD-L1 expression (P=0.046). High TIGIT density and high PVR/TIGIT expression were
      correlated with advanced TNM stage (TIGIT density, P=0.020; PVR/TIGIT expression,
      P=0.041). Patients with positive PVR expression, high TIGIT density, high
      PVR/TIGIT expression and PVR/PD-L1 co-expression exhibited a significantly worse 
      prognosis (PVR, P=0.038; TIGIT, P=0.027; PVR/TIGIT, P=0.014; PVR/PD-L1, P=0.018).
      Multivariate analysis demonstrated that PVR/PD-L1 co-expression (Hazard ratio
      [HR], 1.756, 95% CI, 1.152-2.676, P=0.009) was an independent prognostic factor
      in LUSC patients. In conclusion, we demonstrated the expression status of
      PVR/TIGIT and PD-L1/PD-1 in LUSC. PVR/PD-L1 co-expression was an independent
      prognostic factor in LUSC patients and may serve as a potential predictive
      biomarker for dual-targeting immunotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lesion-related factors are associated with severity of language
      impairment in persons with aphasia. The extent to which demographic and health
      factors predict language impairment beyond traditional cortical measures remains 
      unknown. Identifying and understanding the contributions of factors to predictive
      models of severity constitutes critical knowledge for clinicians interested in
      charting the likely course of aphasia in their patients and designing effective
      treatment approaches in light of those predictions. METHODS: Utilizing
      neuroimaging and language testing from our cohort of 224 individuals in the
      chronic stage of recovery from a left-hemisphere stroke in a cross-sectional
      study, we first conducted a lesion symptom mapping (LSM) analysis to identify
      regions associated with aphasia severity scores. After controlling for lesion
      volume and damage to pre-identified areas, three models were created to predict
      severity scores: 1) Demographic Model (N = 147); 2) Health Model (N = 106); and
      3) Overall Model (N = 106). Finally, all identified factors were entered into a
      Final Model to predict raw severity scores. RESULTS: Two areas were associated
      with aphasia severity-left posterior insula and left arcuate fasciculus. The
      results from the Demographic Model revealed non-linguistic cognitive ability, age
      at stroke, and time post-stroke as significant predictors of severity (P = .005; 
      P = .02; P = .001, respectively), and results from the Health Model suggested the
      extent of leukoaraiosis is associated with severity (P = .0004). The Overall
      Model showed a relationship between aphasia severity and cognitive ability (P =
      .01), time post-stroke (P = .002), and leukoaraiosis (P = .01). In the Final
      Model, which aimed to predict raw severity scores, demographic, health, and
      lesion factors explained 55% of the variance in severity, with health and
      demographic factors uniquely explaining nearly half of performance variance.
      CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study add to the literature suggesting
      patient-specific variables can shed light on individual differences in severity
      beyond lesion factors. Additionally, our results emphasize the importance of
      non-linguistic cognitive ability and brain health in aphasia recovery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate if the presence of metallic markers (markers)
      influences the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative breast MRI for the prediction 
      of pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in
      breast cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-center,
      retrospective, observational study approved by the IRB of our institution, we
      included all consecutive patients that underwent preoperative breast MRI after
      completion of NAC (Mean 4,4 days +/- 15,9). The presence or absence of markers,
      the type of markers, the size and type of artefact on each MRI sequence were
      recorded. Two radiologists blinded to histopathological results and to each
      other's findings evaluated all MRI examinations for presence or absence of
      complete response. Pathology was the standard of reference. Diagnostic
      performance of MRI for prediction of pCR in the presence or absence of markers
      and also between two most represented markers brands (O'Twist and UltraClip) were
      compared using Chi-squared tests or equivalents. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients
      (mean age 48 +/- 11 years) were included in this study. Nineteen of them had no
      markers and 74 had 108 markers. Sensitivity and specificity of MRI for the
      prediction of pCR were 0.73 and 0,81 for patients with and 0.67 and 0.90 for
      patients without markers (p < 0.05).There was no statistical difference in the
      performance of MRI for the two different types of markers studied. CONCLUSION:
      Diagnostic performance of pre-operative MRI after NAC for the prediction of pCR
      did not differ statistically in the presence or absence of metallic markers nor
      between the two markers' brands studied.

AB  - PURPOSE: This prospective study aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of shear
      wave elastography (SWE) with that of shear wave dispersion (SWD) in evaluation of
      hepatic fibrosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma before resection.
      METHOD: A total of 210 consecutive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      who were scheduled to undergo hepatectomy were prospectively enrolled,
      pre-operative SWE and SWD examinations were performed. Fibrosis staging and
      necroinflammatory activity were determined histopathologically according to the
      Scheuer standard. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to identify
      factors associated with SWE and SWD values. The performance of SWE and SWD were
      determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Both SWE
      and SWD values of liver were highly correlated with liver fibrosis stage and
      necroinflammatory activity (p < 0.05). Both SWE and SWD values were significantly
      different among the patients with different stages of liver fibrosis (p < 0.001).
      ROC analysis revealed that SWE that predicted substantial fibrosis (S >/= 2),
      severe fibrosis (S >/= 3) and cirrhosis (S = 4) were 0.895, 0.877 and 0.854, the 
      SWD that predicted substantial fibrosis (S >/= 2), severe fibrosis (S >/= 3) and 
      cirrhosis (S = 4) were 0.857, 0.815 and 0.791. SWE had better diagnostic
      performance than SWD in predicting severe fibrosis (S >/= 3) and cirrhosis (S =
      4). CONCLUSIONS: Both SWE and SWD are useful, accurate and non-invasive methods
      for evaluating hepatic fibrosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma adapted
      to hepatectomy, SWE is a more accurate imaging modality than SWD in predicting
      severe fibrosis (S >/= 3) and cirrhosis (S = 4).

AB  - Poultry meat and eggs are a primary source of animal protein. To meet the market 
      needs, high yield laying hens are reared continuously, resulting in quick ovary
      aging. Thus, we investigated the anti-aging effects of Shudi Erzi San (SES) on
      laying hens. Sixty 300-day-old laying hens were divided into 2 experimental
      groups and a control group. The control group was fed on a basic diet, which was 
      supplemented with 1% and 2% SES for experimental groups I and II, respectively.
      Egg quality and changes in serum hormones and blood-biochemical indicators of
      laying hens were determined. The rate of egg production was significantly higher 
      in group than in both the control and group by 9.29 and 8.22 percentage points,
      respectively (P < 0.05). Eggshell strength of groups and were significantly
      higher than that of the control group (P < 0.01). Albumen height and Haugh Units 
      of group were significantly higher than those of the control (P < 0.05). Serum
      levels of follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol in group were significantly 
      higher than those of both the control and group (P < 0.05), whereas groups and
      had significantly higher serum levels of luteinizing hormone than the control (P 
      < 0.05). Levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) did not significantly differ
      between the control and group (P > 0.05), but SOD and malondialdehyde (MDA)
      levels in group were significantly higher and lower, respectively (P < 0.05) when
      compared to the control. Compared with the control, uric acid levels in groups
      and were significantly lower (P < 0.05), as was urea nitrogen in group (P <
      0.05). Transcriptome and KEGG pathway analysis of ovarian tissues of laying hens 
      showed a significant immune related signal pathway as the possible main regulator
      of a lysosome related signal pathway. Thus, supplementing chicken feed with SES
      improves egg production and quality and alleviates ovarian decline in laying
      hens.

TI  - Effect of beak trimming at hatch and the inclusion of oat hulls in the diet on

AB  - The influence of infrared beak trimming at hatch (IRBT) and the inclusion of oat 
      hulls (OH) in the diet on growth performance, feed preference, exploratory
      pecking behavior, and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) development, was studied in
      brown-egg pullets from 0 to 15 wk of age. The experimental design was completely 
      randomized with 4 treatments arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial with IRBT (sham vs.
      treated) and OH inclusion (0 vs. 3%) as main effects. Each treatment was
      replicated 20 times and the experimental unit was a cage with 10 pullets. Feed
      intake (FI), BW gain, feed conversion ratio (FCR), energy intake (EI, kcal
      AMEn/d), and energy conversion ratio (ECR, kcal AMEn/g of BW gain) were
      determined by feeding period (0 to 6, 7 to 10, and 11 to 15 wk of age) and
      cumulatively. Particle size preference was measured at 7 wk and exploratory
      pecking behavior of the pullets and at 8 to 14 wk of age. From 0 to 6 wk of age, 
      beak trimming decreased FI (P < 0.01) and increased pullet mortality (P < 0.001) 
      but did not affect BW gain. From 0 to 15 wk of age, OH inclusion improved BW
      uniformity (P = 0.090) but impaired FCR (P < 0.05) without showing any effect on 
      BW gain or ECR. Preference for coarse particles was greater for the sham than for
      the treated pullets. Beak trimming and OH feeding reduced (P < 0.05) the
      exploratory pecking behavior of the pullets from 8 to 12 wk of age but not
      thereafter. Oat hulls increased the relative weights of the full gizzard and
      intestines at all ages (P < 0.05). In summary, beak trimming did not affect
      pullet performance at 15 wk of age or GIT development at any age. Oat hulls
      improved GIT development at all ages but did not affect BW or ECR. Both beak
      treatment and OH inclusion affected particle size preference and reduced the
      exploratory pecking behavior of the birds.

AB  - Fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) is a chronic hepatic disease which occurs
      when there is a disorder in lipid metabolism. FLHS is often observed in caged
      laying hens and characterized by a decrease in egg production and dramatic
      increase of mortality. Salidroside (SDS) is an herbal drug which has shown
      numerous pharmacological activities, such as protecting mitochondrial function,
      attenuating cell apoptosis and inflammation, and promoting antioxidant defense
      system. We aimed to determine the therapeutic effects of SDS on FLHS in laying
      hens and investigate the underlying mechanisms through which SDS operates these
      functions. We constructed oleic acid (OA)-induced fatty liver model in vitro and 
      high-fat diet-induced FLHS of laying hens in vivo. The results indicated that SDS
      inhibited OA-induced lipid accumulation in chicken primary hepatocytes, increased
      hepatocyte activity, elevated the mRNA expression of proliferation related genes 
      PCNA, CDK2, and cyclinD1 and increased the protein levels of PCNA and CDK2 (P <
      0.05), as well as decreased the cleavage levels of Caspase-9, Caspase-8, and
      Caspase-3 and apoptosis in hepatocytes (P < 0.05). Moreover, SDS promoted the
      phosphorylation levels of PDK1, AKT, and Gsk3-beta, while inhibited the PI3K
      inhibitor (P < 0.05). Additionally, we found that high-fat diet-induced FLHS hens
      had heavier body weight, liver weight, and abdominal fat weight, and severe
      steatosis in histology, compared with the control group (Con). However, hens fed 
      with SDS maintained lighter body weight, liver weight, and abdominal fat weight, 
      as well as normal liver without hepatic steatosis. In addition, high-fat
      diet-induced FLHS hens had high levels of serum total cholesterol (TC),
      triglyceride (TG), alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase
      (AST) compared to the Con group, however, in the Model+SDS group, the levels of
      TC, TG, ALT, and AST decreased significantly, whereas the level of superoxide
      dismutase (SOD) increased significantly (P < 0.05). We also found that SDS
      significantly decreased the mRNA expression abundance of PPARgamma, SCD, and FAS 
      in the liver, as well as increased levels of PPARalpha and MTTP, and decreased
      the mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 in the Model+SDS group
      (P < 0.05). In summary, this study showed that 0.3 mg/mL SDS attenuated ROS
      generation, inhibited lipid accumulation and hepatocyte apoptosis, and promoted
      hepatocyte proliferation by targeting the PI3K/AKT/Gsk3-beta pathway in
      OA-induced fatty liver model in vitro, and 20 mg/kg SDS alleviated
      high-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory
      response in laying hens in vivo.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The central location, size, and instability of saddle pulmonary
      embolism (SPE) have raised significant concerns regarding its clinical,
      hemodynamic effects as well as optimal management. Pulmonary embolism (PE)
      guidelines barely address such concerns. We aimed to pool the available data on
      the clinical behavior and outcomes of SPE and study the effects of various
      treatment modalities on mortality outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Google
      Scholar were searched for articles (any date up to February 28, 2022) reporting
      patients with SPE. Data on SPE demographics, clinical characteristics,
      management, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Results from all
      SPE cases: A total of 5251 patients from 194 studies were included in the review.
      Dyspnea (57 %) was the most prevalent symptom. Massive and submassive PE
      comprised 9.7 % and 45.8% of cases, respectively. Thrombolytic therapy (TT) was
      administered in 18.1 %, and thrombectomy was performed in 16 % of cases.
      SPE-related mortality was observed in 4.6 %, late decompensation in 9.5 %, and PE
      recurrence in 4.5 % of cases. Female sex (61.5 % vs. 41.3 %, p = 0.019),
      hypoxemia (90 % vs. 59.2 %, p < 0.001), massive PE features (89.7 % vs. 30.1 %, p
      < 0.001), associated chronic kidney disease (CKD) (10.3 % vs. 1.4 %, p = 0.002), 
      and the need for mechanical ventilation (28.2 % vs. 13.1 %, p = 0.02) were
      significantly associated with increased mortality. The use of TT was
      significantly associated with increased survival (27.1 % vs. 12.5 %, p < 0.001). 
      In a multivariate logistic regression model, massive PE features significantly
      increased the odds of death (OR: 29.3, CI: 4.86-181.81, p < 0.001), whereas,
      treatment with anticoagulation (AC) alone (OR: 0.1, CI: 0.027-0.356, p < 0.001), 
      TT (OR: 0.065, CI: 0.019-0.26, p < 0.001), surgical thrombectomy (ST) (OR: 0.047,
      CI: (0.010-0.23), p < 0.001), or percutaneous thrombectomy (PT) (OR: 0.12, CI:
      0.020-0.84, p = 0.032) significantly decreased odds of death. Results from a
      meta-analysis of observational studies: Meta-analysis of the included 17
      observational studies revealed an overall 10 % (95 % CI: 4.56-16.89) SPE
      prevalence among all PE cases. The overall SPE-related mortality rate was 8 % (95
      % CI: 5.26-10.96). Massive PE was observed in 13.3 % (95 % CI: 5.56-23.70), PE
      recurrence in 5.1 % (95 % CI: 2.22-9.05), and late decompensation in 11 % (95 %
      CI: 3.43-22.34) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: SPE comprises 10 % of all PE cases.
      Despite its ominous radiologic appearance, the clinical, hemodynamic, and
      mortality outcomes of SPE seem comparable to that of other PE types in general.
      The presence of massive PE features is the main predictor of mortality in SPE
      patients. AC, TT, ST, and PT are all associated with decreased odds of death from
      SPE.

      index monomer Bis-EFMA.

AB  - With the aim to prepare Bis-GMA-free bulk-filled dental resin composite (DRC),
      Bis-GMA-free resin matrix was prepared by mixing Bis-EFMA with TEGDMA at two mass
      ratios (Bis-EFMA/TEGDMA = 50 wt/50 wt and 60 wt/40 wt), and the bulk-filled resin
      composites were then obtained by mixing resin matrix with silanated glass fillers
      at a mass ratio of 30 wt/70 wt. Bis-GMA based resin composites were used as
      control. Refractive indexes of resin matrixes were measured. Besides the depth of
      cure mentioned in ISO standard, double bond conversion (DC) and bottom/top
      Vickers hardness (VHN) ratio of resin composites were investigated to evaluate
      the curing depth. Physicochemical properties, such as flexural properties,
      volumetric shrinkage (VS), shrinkage stress (SS), water sorption (WS) and
      solubility (SL), and cytotoxicity of resin composites were tested and
      statistically analyzed (ANOVA, Tukey's, p = 0.05). The results showed that
      Bis-EFMA/TEGDMA resin matrixes had higher refractive indexes than Bis-GMA/TEGDMA 
      resin matrixes. Viscosities of Bis-EFMA based DRCs were higher than Bis-GMA based
      DRCs. Bis-EFMA-based (50/50) DRC had comparable depth of cure, DC, and VHN as
      Bis-GMA-based (50/50) DRC (p > 0.05). Though Bis-EFMA/TEGDMA (60/40) had the
      highest refractive index in all resin matrix, the corresponding DRCs had the
      lowest depth of cure, DC, and bottom/top VHN ratio in all groups (p < 0.05).
      Replacing Bis-GMA with Bis-EFMA had no negative effect on flexural properties, WS
      and SL of DRCs, and could reduce VS and SS of DRCs. Results of CCK8 assay showed 
      that all of DRCs had the same cytotoxicity (p > 0.05), and the thickness of
      sample had no influence on the cytotoxicity (p > 0.05). All the results indicated
      that Bis-EFMA could be used to replace Bis-GMA to prepare bulk-filled dental
      resin composites. According to the results of depth of cure, DC, and bottom/top
      VHN ratio, 50 wt/50 wt was more appropriate than 60 wt/40 wt as the mass ratio of
      Bis-EFMA and TEGDMA in the resin matrix for bulk-filled dental resin composites.

AB  - AIMS: To assess associations that endogenous estradiol and testosterone levels
      have with cognitive function in older adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM). METHODS: We use data from the Look AHEAD clinical trial of behavioral
      weight loss. Endogenous estradiol and total testosterone levels were determined
      using stored serum from 996 individuals, mean age 69 years, at two times
      (averaging 4 years apart) during years 8-18 of follow-up. One to four
      standardized assessments of attention, executive function, memory, and verbal
      fluency were collected during this follow-up. Mixed effects models and multiple
      imputation were used to assess associations that estradiol and total testosterone
      levels had with body mass index and cognitive function. RESULTS: Estradiol levels
      were not associated with cognitive function in either sex. Total testosterone
      levels were not associated with cognitive function in women, but greater total
      testosterone levels were associated with better verbal fluency in men (p <
      0.001), most strongly among those carrying the APOE-e4 allele (interaction p =
      0.02). The weight loss intervention left a legacy of relatively lower cognitive
      functioning among women, which was not mediated by current levels of sex
      hormones. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral weight loss intervention does not affect
      cognitive functioning through mechanisms related to estradiol or testosterone.

AB  - Mosaic variants are regularly detected on hereditary cancer genetic tests. While 
      some of these variants may be constitutional, the majority are likely limited to 
      blood lineages. In the present study, we correlate clinical histories from
      individuals with mosaic findings identified on hereditary cancer testing and the 
      outcomes of follow-up fibroblast (FB) testing. We observed 620 mosaic variants,
      including 339 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (PVs) occurring most often
      in TP53, CHEK2, ATM, and NF1. About half of individuals with NF1 mosaic PVs did
      not report any clinical features of NF1 and were older at testing (p<0.0001)
      compared to those with an NF1-related phenotype. Among 42 mosaic PVs evaluated by
      FB testing, 17 (40.5%) were confirmed in FB and were mostly identified in
      individuals with phenotypes consistent with the gene disease spectrum. Our data
      show that FB testing is helpful for identifying those with likely constitutional 
      mosaicism benefitting from increased screening and follow-up vs. those with
      blood-limited variants potentially not requiring intense surveillance but
      warranting further hematologic work-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Beta-ureidopropionase deficiency, caused by variants in UPB1, has
      been reported in association with various neurodevelopmental phenotypes including
      intellectual disability, seizures and autism. AIM: We aimed to reassess the
      relationship between variants in UPB1 and a clinical phenotype. METHODS:
      Literature review, calculation of carrier frequencies from population databases, 
      long-term follow-up of a previously published case and reporting of additional
      cases. RESULTS: Fifty-three published cases were identified, and two additional
      cases are reported here. Of these, 14 were asymptomatic and four had transient
      neurological features; clinical features in the remainder were variable and
      included non-neurological presentations. Several of the variants previously
      reported as pathogenic are present in population databases at frequencies higher 
      than expected for a rare condition. In particular, the variant most frequently
      reported as pathogenic, p.Arg326Gln, is very common among East Asians, with a
      carrier frequency of 1 in 19 and 1 in 907 being homozygous for the variant in
      gnomAD v2.1.1. CONCLUSION: Pending the availability of further evidence, UPB1
      should be considered a 'gene of uncertain clinical significance'. Caution should 
      be used in ascribing clinical significance to biochemical features of
      beta-ureidopropionase deficiency and/or UPB1 variants in patients with
      neurodevelopmental phenotypes. UPB1 is not currently suitable for inclusion in
      gene panels for reproductive genetic carrier screening. SYNOPSIS: The
      relationship between beta-ureidopropionase deficiency due to UPB1 variants and
      clinical phenotypes is uncertain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of
      barotrauma (pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema) in mechanically
      ventilated COVID-19 patients. To describe the chest radiography patterns of
      barotrauma and understand the development in relation to mechanical ventilation
      and patient mortality. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 363
      patients with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 8, 2020. Primary outcomes were
      pneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema with or without pneumothorax,
      pneumoperitoneum, or pneumoretroperitoneum. The secondary outcomes were length of
      intubation and death. In patients with pneumomediastinum and/or subcutaneous
      emphysema, we conducted an imaging review to determine the timeline of barotrauma
      development. RESULTS: Forty three out of 363 (12%) patients developed barotrauma 
      radiographically. The median time to development of either pneumomediastinum or
      subcutaneous emphysema was 2 days (IQR 1.0-4.5) after intubation and the median
      time to pneumothorax was 7 days (IQR 2.0-10.0). The overall incidence of
      pneumothorax was 28/363 (8%) with an incidence of 17/43 (40%) in the barotrauma
      cohort and 11/320 (3%) in those without barotrauma (p </= 0.001). In total,
      257/363 (71%) patients died with an increase in mortality in those with
      barotrauma 33/43 (77%) vs. 224/320 (70%). When adjusting for covariates,
      barotrauma was associated with increased odds of death (OR 2.99, 95% CI
      1.25-7.17). CONCLUSION: Barotrauma is a frequent complication of mechanically
      ventilated COVID-19 patients. In comparison to intubated COVID-19 patients
      without barotrauma, there is a higher rate of pneumothorax and an increased risk 
      of death.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT), prior to the COVID pandemic, was 
      rare representing 0.5 of all strokes, with the diagnosis made by MRI or CT
      venography.(1-,3) COVID-19 patients compared to general populations have a 30-60 
      times greater risk of CVT compared to non-affected populations, and up to a third
      of severe COVID patients may have thrombotic complications.(4-8) Currently,
      vaccines are the best way to prevent severe COVID-19. In February 2021, reports
      of CVT and Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) related to
      adenovirus viral vector vaccines including the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine
      (AZD1222 (ChAdOx1)) and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine (JNJ-78436735
      (Ad26.COV2.S)), were noted, with a 1/583,000 incidence from Johnson and Johnson
      vaccine in the United States.(11, 12) This study retrospectively analyzed CVT and
      cross-sectional venography at an Eastern Medical Center from 2018 to 2021, and
      presents radiographic examples of CVT and what is learned from the immune
      response. METHODS: After IRB approval, a retrospective review of cross-sectional 
      CTV and MRVs from January 1st 2018 to April 30th 2021, at a single health system 
      was performed. Indications, vaccine status, patient age, sex, and positive
      finding incidence were specifically assessed during March and April for each
      year. A multivariable-adjusted trends analysis using Poisson regression estimated
      venogram frequencies and multivariable logistic regression compared sex, age,
      indications and vaccination status. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From January 1, 2018 
      to April 30, 2021, (Fig. 1), a total of n = 2206 in patient and emergency room
      cross-sectional venograms were obtained, with 322 CTVs and 1884 MRVs. In 2018,
      2019, 2020, respective totals of cross-sectional venograms were 568, 657, 660,
      compared to 321 cross-sectional venograms in the first four months of 2021. CTV
      in 2018, 2019, 2020, respective totals were 51, 86, 97, MRV totals were 517, 571,
      563, compared to the 2021 first four month totals of 88 CTVs and 233 MRVs. March,
      April 2018, 2019, 2020, CTVs respectively were 6, 17, 11, compared to the 2021
      first four months of 59 CTVs, comprising 63% of the total 93 CTVs, respective
      MRVs were 79, 97, 52, compared to 143 MRVs in the first four months of 2021 for
      39% of the total 371 MRVs. In March, April 2020 during the pandemic onset,
      cross-sectional imaging at the East Coast Medical Center decreased, as priorities
      were on maintaining patient ventilation, high level of care and limiting spread
      of disease. In March/April 2021, reports of VITT and CVT likely contributed to
      increased CTVs and MRVs, of 39.65% [1.20-1.63] increase (P < 0.001) from prior.
      In March, April 2021 of 202 venograms obtained, 158 (78.2.%) were unvaccinated
      patients, 16 positive for CVT (10.1%), 44 were on vaccinated patients (21.7%), 8 
      specifically ordered with vaccination as a clinical indication, 2 positive for
      CVT (4.5%), (odds ratio = 0.52 [0.12-2.38], p = 0.200). CONCLUSION: CTV prior to 
      the COVID pandemic, was rare, responsible for 0.5 of all strokes, at the onset of
      the pandemic in the East Coast, overall cross-sectional imaging volumes declined 
      due to maintaining ventilation, high levels of care and limiting disease spread, 
      although COVID-19 patients have a 30-60 times greater risk of CVT compared to the
      general population, and vaccination is currently the best option to mitigate
      severe disease. In early 2021, reports of adenoviral vector COVID vaccines
      causing CTV and VITT, led to at 39.65% increase in cross-sectional venography,
      however, in this study unvaccinated patients in 2021 had higher incidence of CVT 
      (10.1%), compared to the vaccinated patients (4.5%). Clinicians should be aware
      that VITT CVT may present with a headache 5-30 days post-vaccination with
      thrombosis best diagnosed on CTV or MRV. If thrombosis is present with
      thrombocytopenia, platelets <150 x 10(9), elevated D-Dimer >4000 FEU, and
      positive anti-PF4 ELISA assay, the diagnosis is definitive.(13) VITT CVT
      resembles spontaneous autoimmune heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and is
      postulated to occur from platelet factor 4 (PF4) binding to vaccine adenoviral
      vectors forming a novel antigen, anti-PF4 memory B-cells and anti-PF4 (VITT)
      antibodies.(14-17).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The relationship that vaccination against corona virus disease 19
      (COVID-19) or recovery from the acute form of the illness may have with the
      incidence or severity of acute appendicitis (AA) has not been explored. The aim
      of this study was to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: A single centre
      retrospective study of all consecutive adult patients presenting with AA in the 6
      mo after the initiation of a national vaccination program was performed. The
      presenting characteristics and pathological data of patients who had either been 
      vaccinated against or recovered from COVID-19 were compared with those who had
      not. In addition, historical data from the equivalent period 12 and 24 mo
      beforehand was also extracted. The incidence of AA was compared between each of
      these time-frames. RESULTS: Of the 258 patients initially identified, 255 were
      included in the analysis of which 156 had either been vaccinated and/or recovered
      from COVID-19 (61.2%) whilst 99 (38.8%) patients had not. When comparing these
      two groups, there were no significant differences in the presenting
      characteristics, operative findings or postoperative courses. There was also no
      significant change in the incidence of AA when comparing the study dates with
      historical data (median weekly incidence of AA 8.0 versus 8.0 versus 8.0
      respectively, P = 0.672). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data presented here, we
      failed to find a relationship between a national vaccination program and both the
      nature and incidence of AA presenting to a busy urban hospital.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The need for routine surgical excision of a radial sclerosing
      lesions (RSL) of the breast identified on percutaneous biopsy remains
      controversial, as contemporary upgrade rates are lower than historically cited.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospectively-maintained database of high-risk breast
      biopsies undergoing multidisciplinary review at a single institution was queried 
      to identify cases of RSL from 2/2015 to 11/2020. Demographic, radiologic, and
      pathologic variables were summarized using frequencies and analyzed in
      association with RSL excision status using mixed-effects logistic regression or
      Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: 217 RSL were identified, diagnosed at a mean age
      of 57 y. The median imaging size was 1.3 cm and the majority had estimated >50%
      of the target removed by core needle biopsy. 32.3% underwent surgical excision of
      the RSL biopsy site and 2/70 (2.9%) upgraded to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
      on final surgical pathology. Upgrade was significantly higher for atypical RSL (P
      = 0.02). None of the RSL (n = 60) without atypia who had undergone excision were 
      upgraded. For those omitting surgical excision, there was no subsequent breast
      cancer diagnosis at the RSL site over a mean follow-up of 23 mo. CONCLUSIONS:
      Surgical excision may be omitted for RSL without atypia as this group has 0% risk
      of upgrade after multidisciplinary review.

TI  - Step 1 is Pass/Fail, Now What? Can Clinical Clerkship Grades be Used as a
      Reliable Metric to Screen General Surgery Residency Applicants?

AB  - INTRODUCTION: For decades, the three-digit United States Medical Licensing Exam
      Step 1 score has been used to competitively evaluate and compare candidates
      during the residency application process. Starting in 2022, however, all Step 1
      scores will be converted to pass/fail. A different quantitative measure will
      likely gain importance in its stead, one such being clerkship performance grades.
      This study aims to determine the consistency of class rank and distribution of
      clerkship grades reported by medical schools for applicants to a general surgery 
      program. METHODS: Candidates' Medical Student Performance Evaluation letters from
      141 unique US allopathic medical schools were reviewed for student overall class 
      rank, the number of grading tiers in each clerkship, and the percent achieving
      honors criteria in each clerkship from the 2020 application cycle. Comparative
      analysis was performed by region and medical school prestige. RESULTS: Most
      medical schools rank students using a four-tier system (e.g., fail, pass, high
      pass, and honors). A third of schools do not provide an overall class rank of
      students (34.7% of schools); this was most prevalent in the Northeast and Western
      regions. Schools in the Central US more often rank their students in five tiers
      compared to the South (P < 0.01). The percent of students that achieve the
      highest grading tier varies across the core clerkships (mean 37.1%, range
      6.5%-78%); an average of 34.5% of students meet the highest honors tier in their 
      Surgery clerkship. Students at US News and World Report Top 20 medical schools
      are more likely to receive the highest honors tier, across all core clerkships
      and overall class rank, than students at schools outside the Top 20 (P < 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of the United States Medical Licensing Exam Step 1
      score, the variability in clerkship grading tiers and overall class rank will
      likely pose a challenge to residency programs' ability to stratify desirable
      applicants. Further transparency and standardization may be required to compare
      students objectively and fairly from medical schools across the country.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: While complication rates have been well described using the
      National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and National Surgical
      Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric registries, there have been no direct
      comparisons of outcomes between adults and children. Our objective was to
      describe differences in postoperative outcomes between children and adults
      undergoing common surgical procedures. METHODS: Using data from 2013 to 2017, we 
      identified patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy, thyroidectomy, and colectomy. Propensity score matching on
      gender, race, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, surgical indication,
      and procedure type was performed. Outcomes included surgical site infection
      (SSI), readmission rates, mortality/serious morbidity, and hospital length of
      stay and were analyzed using chi(2) and student's t-test with statistical
      significance defined as P < 0.05. RESULTS: We matched 79,866 patients from 812
      hospitals. Compared to adults, children had higher rates of SSI following
      appendectomy (4.12% versus 1.40%, P < 0.01) and cholecystectomy (0.96% versus
      0.66%, P = 0.04), readmission following appendectomy (4.26% versus 2.47%, P <
      0.01), and longer length of stay in all procedures. In adults, 30-day
      mortality/serious morbidity was higher for all procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Compared 
      to adults, children demonstrate unique surgical complication and outcome
      profiles. Quality improvement efforts such as SSI prevention bundles and enhanced
      recovery protocols used in adults should be expanded to children.

TI  - Nitric oxide signalling underlies salicylate-induced increases in neuronal firing
      in the inferior colliculus: A central mechanism of tinnitus?: NO dependence of
      salicylate effects in IC.

AB  - The anti-inflammatory drug salicylate induces tinnitus in animals and man.
      Salicylate reduces cochlear output but causes hyperactivity in higher auditory
      centres, including the inferior colliculus (the auditory midbrain). Using
      multi-electrode recording in anaesthetised guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), we
      addressed the hypothesis that salicylate-induced hyperactivity in the inferior
      colliculus involves nitric oxide signalling secondary to increased ascending
      excitatory input. Systemic salicylate (200 mg/kg i.p., 0 h) markedly increased
      spontaneous and sound-driven neuronal firing in the inferior colliculus (3-6 h
      post drug), with both onset and sustained responses to pure tones being massively
      increased. Reverse microdialysis of increasing concentrations of salicylate
      directly into the inferior colliculus (100 microM-10 mM, from 0 h) failed to
      mimic systemic salicylate. In contrast, it caused a small, transient, increase in
      sound-driven firing (1 h), followed by a larger sustained decrease in both
      spontaneous and sound-driven firing (2-5 h). When salicylate was given
      systemically, reverse microdialysis of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase
      inhibitor L-methyl arginine into the inferior colliculus (500 mM, 2-6 h)
      completely blocked the salicylate-induced increase in spontaneous and
      sound-driven neuronal firing. Our data indicate that systemic salicylate induces 
      neuronal hyperactivity in the auditory midbrain via a mechanism outside the
      inferior colliculus, presumably upstream in the auditory pathway; and that the
      mechanism is ultimately dependent on nitric oxide signalling within the inferior 
      colliculus. Given that nitric oxide is known to mediate NMDA receptor signalling 
      in the inferior colliculus, we propose that salicylate activates an ascending
      glutamatergic input to the inferior colliculus and that this is an important
      mechanism underlying salicylate-induced tinnitus.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Manganese-based catalysts attract extensive attentions in
      low-temperature selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxide (NOx).
      However, seldom work focuses on the existence of free radicals and their roles in
      SCR. EXPERIMENTS: In this work, electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer and 
      density functional theory are combined to reveal surface characterizations of
      manganese oxide and Ce/La-doped manganese oxides. FINDINGS: As a result,
      superoxide radical (O2*) exists on manganese-oxide surface, produces
      nitrogen-containing free radical, and functions as electron transfer between NOx 
      and NH3 at 100 degrees C, resulting in good NOx conversion as well as N2
      selectivity at the same time. The O2* is born of accepting electrons on adsorbed 
      oxygen through overlapped orbits of Mn-d and O-p. Additional metal doping
      increases the percentage of O2* among all oxygen species from 2.9% to 6.9% (Ce
      doping) and 5.1% (La doping). The order of O2* percentage is consistent with the 
      NOx-conversion order at 100 degrees C, i.e., Ce doping (91.6%)>La doping
      (55.7%)>catalyst without doping (27.5%). Above result helps to understand
      interface behaviors of manganese-based catalyst in SCR. This work is also in
      favor of developing more effective low-temperature catalysts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Rydel Seiffer tuning fork (RSTF) can be easily applied to
      evaluate deficits of vibration perception. Standard normative data as stated in
      textbooks (6/8-thresholds among the "elderly") is not suitable for an informed
      decision-making process. OBJECTIVE: To reevaluate the range of vibration
      detection thresholds (VDT) based on assessments in healthy Caucasians stratified 
      for age and gender using the RSTF and on a short-review of literature on
      normative data on PubMed. METHODS: Monocentric, prospective assessment of VDT at 
      the dorsal 1st metatarsophalangeal joint of both sides in 77 healthy volunteers. 
      Participants were grouped according to age: 20-39 years (group I, n = 24), 40-59 
      years (group II, n = 29), 60-79 years (group III, n = 24). Data was stratified
      for gender. Means were compared via Mann-Whitney U-test; correlations were rated 
      via Pearson correlation coefficient. A short-review of literature was performed
      on PubMed. RESULTS: Aging related to declined vibration perception (r = -0.446, p
      < 0.001). Women aged 60 years and older showed better vibration perception
      compared to men (men: 6.5 +/- 1.3, women: 7.5 +/- 0.9, p = 0.003). All VDT-limits
      were higher compared to results gathered in literature (I: 7.9 +/- 0.3, II: 7.7
      +/- 0.5, III: 7.1 +/- 1.1). Formerly reported VDT-limits at the lower limbs were 
      scattered (e.g., >4.5/8 to >/=6.6/8 at age 18-29). Current data, especially VDT
      of participants aged 50 years and older, were largely in line with data reported 
      by Hilz et al. 1998: 18-29 years: >/= 6.6/8, 30-39 years: >/= 5.5/8, 40-49 years:
      >/= 5.7/8, 50-59 years: >/= 5.4/8, 60-69 years >/= 5.2/8, > 70 years >/= 5.3/8,
      alternative: 30-39 years >/= 6.2/8 Magerl et al. 2010. Data on diagnostic
      sensitivity by Xirou et al. 2020 supported a VDT-limit of 5.9/8 across all ages
      to aim for high sensitivity. A better vibration perception among elder women
      compared to men has been described by many studies. DISCUSSION: The current data 
      and literature underline, that higher VDT-limits stratified for age and gender
      should be considered in a clinical setting. Until further validation within
      larger samples, we propose to consider the limits as reported by Hilz et al.
      1998. Furthermore, women at age 60 + years presenting with borderline thresholds 
      should be considered for further diagnostic workup.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is among the most prevalent lymphomas
      worldwide. PAX5 has a great value in separating this entity from other T cell
      lymphoma; however, it is weakly expressed in neoplastic cells. Polyclonal PAX8
      was positive in a variety of lymphoid neoplasms in several previous studies and
      the staining paralleled that of PAX5 but monoclonal PAX8 was negative in the same
      neoplasms. The aim of this study was to compare immunohistochemical patterns of
      monoclonal PAX8 with PAX5 in Classical and NLPHL samples. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      This retrospective study was conducted on 89 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded
      blocks from HL patients (69 Classical and 20 NLPHL) admitted to Imam Khomeini and
      Dr. Shariati hospitals, Tehran, Iran during 2016-2020. Diagnoses were confirmed
      by reviewing previous immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies, including PAX5. All
      samples were stained for PAX8 (clone MRQ-50). Expression intensity scoring was
      made for both antibodies in neoplastic and background cells based on nuclear
      staining percentage. RESULTS: PAX8 was positive in neoplastic and background B
      lymphocytes of all classical and NLPHL samples. PAX8 Expression intensity was
      significantly higher in neoplastic and background cells compared to PAX5 in
      classical HL samples (P = 0.001). PAX5 expression intensity in neoplastic cells
      was significantly higher in NLPHL samples compared to classical HL (P = 0.040);
      however, no significant difference in PAX8 expression between neoplastic cells of
      NLPHL and HL was seen. PAX8 expression intensity was not significantly correlated
      with gender, histologic subtype, tumor location, and relapse. CONCLUSIONS: PAX8
      monoclonal antibody (clone MRQ-50) showed strong nuclear reactivity in neoplastic
      and background cells of classical HL and NLPHL samples. Therefore, this marker
      can be utilized as a valuable alternative for PAX5 in differentiating HL from
      other T cell lymphoma in challenging cases.

AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a treatment technique with great potential
      for sanitizing digested sewage sludge (SS) and converting it into valuable
      products. In particular, phosphorus (P) recovery from hydrothermally carbonized
      SS has attracted special attention in recent years. This work aims to examine the
      leaching efficiency of P and the consequent release of metals and heavy metals
      from SS hydrochars (at 180, 215 and 250 degrees C) using organic acids (oxalate
      and citrate) over a range of pH values (0-4) and extraction times (5 min-24 h).
      Both organic acids triggered P extraction efficiencies exceeding 75 % at the
      lowest pH, but only oxalate reached a nearly complete P release from hydrochars
      at pH > 0 and for all carbonization temperatures. Low HTC temperature (180
      degrees C) and short extraction time (5 min) were the optimal conditions
      treatment for P recovery when reacted in oxalate solutions of maximal pH
      buffering capacity (pH = 1.4). However, oxalate leaching also transferred
      metals/heavy metals into the P-leachate, with the exception of Ca being retained 
      in the solid residue from HTC as Ca-oxalate precipitate. Different
      characterization methods confirmed the presence of this precipitate, and provided
      information about the surface and morphological changes of the SS hydrochars
      following acid treatment. The results suggest that HTC not only a promising
      technique to sanitize and reduce the volume of SS, but also an efficient means
      for P recovery using oxalic acid, thus contributing to the circular economy of P.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been found at relatively elevated
      concentrations in landfill leachates. Some landfill facilities treat
      physical-chemical parameters of their leachates using on-site leachate treatment 
      systems before discharge. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether
      changes in physical-chemical parameters of leachate at on-site treatment systems 
      (including bulk measurements, oxygen demanding components, and metals) were
      associated with concentration changes in PFAS. Leachates were evaluated at 15
      on-site treatment facilities which included pond systems, aeration tanks,
      powdered activated carbon (PAC), sand filtration, reverse osmosis (RO) and
      combination treatment processes. Results show that most physical-chemical
      parameters and PFAS were significantly reduced in RO systems (over 90 %). For
      pond systems, statistically significant correlations (rs > 0.6, p < 0.05) were
      observed between summation operator26PFAS changes and the changes in pH,
      alkalinity, ammonia, and some metals. Significant correlations were also found
      between summation operator8PFAAs precursors changes and specific conductivity
      (SPC), pH, alkalinity, ammonia, and metals changes. For aeration tank systems,
      significant correlations (rs > 0.6, p < 0.05) were observed between summation
      operator26PFAS changes and changes in total dissolved solids and zinc, and
      between the changes of summation operator8PFAAs precursors and field pH. These
      correlations are believed to be associated with rainfall dilution and
      precipitation of calcium carbonate and other metals as leachate is introduced to 
      the atmosphere.

AB  - In tsetse-infested areas of Ethiopia, African Animal Trypanosomiasis is the most 
      serious threat to livestock productivity. A cross-sectional study was conducted
      from May 2021 to September 2021 in the Zaba Gazo district to assess the
      prevalence and associated risk factors of bovine trypanosomiasis through
      parasitological and hematological techniques. In the current study, the overall
      prevalence of trypanosomiasis was found to be 21%. Among anticipated risk
      factors, the origin of animals has shown a statistically significant association 
      (p < 0.05) with the occurrence of bovine trypanosomiasis. Other potential risk
      factors, such as sex, age, BCS, coat color, and agroecology, were not shown to
      have a statistically significant relationship (p > 0.05) with trypanosomiasis.
      The overall mean PCV values for parasitaemic and aparasitaemic cattle were 23.24 
      +/- 3.04SD and 27.37 +/- 4.18SD, respectively, thus it was lower in parasitaemic 
      animals than the aparasitaemic animals. A high prevalence of bovine
      trypanosomiasis in the study area necessitates an integrated parasite and vector 
      control approach to curve the prevalence and effect of the disease.

AB  - Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) were ubiquitous,
      persistent chemical compounds attached to particulate matter in the atmosphere.
      We aimed to study the characteristics of these pollutants in atmospheric PM2.5 of
      three Asian countries, including Taiwan (Taipei), Thailand (Chiang Mai), and
      Vietnam (Hanoi). We carried out a source apportionment analysis to determine
      significant PCDD/F contributors in these areas. Multiple media model was
      conducted to access the health impact assessment. The PM2.5 concentration in
      Taipei (n = 7), Chiang Mai (n = 20), and Hanoi (n = 10) were 18.4 +/- 6.21
      mug/m(3), 133 +/- 49.5 mug/m(3), and 88.1 +/- 12.6 microg/m(3), respectively. The
      PCDD/Fs level in Hanoi was 92.4 +/- 67.3 fg I-TEQ/m(3,) and in Taipei and Chiang 
      Mai was 5.01 +/- 2.39 fg I-TEQ/m(3) and 14.4 +/- 13.1 fg I-TEQ/m(3),
      respectively, which showed that the higher PM2.5 concentration was not necessary 
      to follow with higher PCDD/Fs level. In all three cities, the effect of traffic
      on ambient PCDD/F level was significant (23-25 %). However, we also observed the 
      specific sources of PCDD/Fs in each city during the sampling periods, namely
      long-range transport (Taipei, 55 %), Biomass/open burning (Chiang Mai, 77 %), and
      industrial activities (Hanoi, 34 %). In the carcinogenic risk estimation, the
      highest median total carcinogenic risk was in Hanoi (5.87 x 10(-6)), followed by 
      Chiang Mai (1.06x10(-6)), and Taipei (2.95 x 10(-7)). Although diet was the major
      absorption pathway, the food contributor of exposure differed among the three
      areas due to the difference in food consumption composition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Different treatment strategies can have varying effects on disability
      and whole brain volume in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the
      association between regional brain volume and treatment efficacy is currently
      unclear. Our objective was to determine whether whole brain volume, as well as
      the regional volume of cortical and subcortical grey matter, differ with the
      administration of high-efficacy therapy (HET) versus low-efficacy therapy (LET). 
      METHODS: We evaluated clinical data and change in regional brain volume in 44
      patients with relapse-onset MS, who underwent HET (n = 19) or LET (n = 25).
      Regional brain volume was determined with three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic 
      resonance imaging using FreeSurfer. The association between volume change and
      treatment type was assessed via generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). RESULTS:
      During the observation period (2.0 +/- 0.16 years), the proportion of patients
      with a "no evidence of disease activity-3'' status was significantly greater in
      those who underwent HET versus LET (p = 0.012). HET was positively associated
      with volume changes in the cortex (beta = 0.64, p = 0.0499), left (beta = 0.98, p
      = 0.0033) and right (beta = 0.77, p = 0.019) caudate and right putamen (beta =
      0.87, p = 0.0077), after adjusting for age, sex, and MS severity scores in the
      GLMMs. Further correction for multiple comparisons by false discovery rate
      revealed that HET was consistently associated with the volume changes of the left
      caudate (p = 0.049) and right putamen (p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: HET can improve
      the mid-term prognosis of Japanese patients with relapse-onset MS by reducing
      disease activity and regional brain volume loss.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Unihemispheric head gunshot wound (HGSW) are associated with
      improved survival; however, specific clinical and radiographic characteristics
      associated with survival have not been clearly defined. To further guide
      prognosis estimates and care discussions, this study aims to identify
      unihemispheric HGSWs injury patterns; comparing them to bihemispheric HGSWs
      characterizing factors associated with improved clinical outcomes and survival.
      METHODS: Patients presenting to our Level 1 trauma center from January 2013
      through May 2019 with HGSW injury were reviewed. Patients were grouped into those
      with unihemispheric versus bihemispheric HGSWs and survivors versus
      non-survivors. Clinical variables and head computed tomography (CT) features were
      compared using comparative statistics. RESULTS: 62 HGSW patients met study
      criteria (unihemispheric = 33, bihemispheric = 29). Regardless of injury type,
      avoidance of injury to multiple lobes, temporal, parietal and basal ganglia brain
      regions and intracranial vascular injury were also associated with survival (p < 
      0.05). Lower admission GCS score and lower motor GCS score was associated with
      reduced survival in unihemispheric HGSW injury (p < 0.05). Unihemispheric HGSW
      survivors demonstrated improved clinical outcomes, with reduced hospital length
      of stay (5 days vs. 47 days, p = 0.014) and intensive care unit length of stay (3
      days vs. 20 days, p = 0.021) and more favorable disposition location. CONCLUSION:
      We found presenting clinical features and CT imaging patterns previously
      associated with improved survival in HGSW patients is similar in unihemispheric
      specific injuries. Importantly, a more favorable admission GCS score may portend 
      survivability in unihemsipheric HGSW. Furthermore, unihemispheric HGSW survivors 
      may have improved clinical outcomes, length of stay and disposition location.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare patient responses to validated satisfaction surveys for
      in-person vs virtual otolaryngology ambulatory evaluation. METHODS: National
      Research Corporation (NRC) Health patient survey answers between April 2020 and
      February 2021 were divided into in-person and virtual visit modalities. Responses
      were compared with two group t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Relationships
      between visit modality by gender, age, race, and sub-specialty visit type and
      satisfaction scores were examined by testing interactions with separate ANOVA
      models. RESULTS: 1242 in-person and 216 virtual patient satisfaction survey
      responses were highly favorable for all themes (communication, comprehension of
      treatment plan, and likelihood of future referral) with both visit modalities.
      Higher satisfaction for in-person evaluation was seen with communication ("care
      providers listened" 3.68 (0.67)-on a scale of 1-no to 4-yes, definitely) vs 3.57 
      (0.78), p = 0.0426; "courtesy/respect" 3.75 (0.62) vs 3.66 (0.69), p = 0.0265)), 
      and comprehension of treatment plan ("enough info about treatment" 3.53 (0.79) vs
      3.37 (0.92), p = 0.0120; "know what to do" 3.62 (0.76) vs 3.46 (0.88), p =
      0.0023)). No differences were detected for future referral of clinic or provider.
      There was no association between visit modality and patient sociodemographic
      factors or sub-specialty visit types. Main effects were observed with respect to 
      race, gender, and sub-specialty visit type. CONCLUSION: Patient satisfaction
      scores for virtual visit evaluation were high and comparable to in-person
      evaluation, with a slight preference for in-person. Future studies are needed to 
      identify which patients and conditions are particularly suited for virtual vs
      in-person delivery of otolaryngology services.

      administered during labour and the risk of requiring an operative delivery
      (caesarean section or operative vaginal delivery). METHODS: This was a
      retrospective, multicentric cohort study. All singleton births of viable foetuses
      in cephalic presentation with a gestational age >/= 37 weeks delivered between
      2016 and2019 were included. A propensity score (PS) matching analysis was used to
      obtain comparable groups, balancing the maternal and pregnancy characteristics
      that required epidural analgesia during labour. The risk of operative delivery in
      women with and without epidural analgesia was estimated following PS-matching
      analysis (1:1 ratio). RESULTS: As per the unmatched analysis, the occurrence of
      Caesarean section (CS) was significantly higher in women administered EA compared
      with the non-EA group (14.0 % vs 5.0 %; p < 0.001). The incidence of operative
      vaginal delivery (OVD) (9.1 % vs 4.0 %; p < 0.001) showed a similar pattern. The 
      PS algorithm matched 16.301 cases who were administered EA with 16.301 cases not 
      administered EA and found a significantly increased risk of CS (OR, 1.6; 95 %CI
      1.5-1.7) and OVD (OR, 1.2; 95 % CI 1.1-1.2) in the former group. CONCLUSION: The 
      risk of operative delivery almost halved in the EA group compared with the non-EA
      group, compared with the baseline risk of the unmatched subjects.

AB  - PURPOSE: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has good clinical guiding value for
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. This study aimed to apply a novel
      genetic analysis approach for therapeutic prediction based on ctDNA alterations. 
      METHOD: This nonrandomized, multicenter study recruited 223 MBC patients
      (NCT05079074). Plasma samples were collected for target-capture deep sequencing
      of ctDNA at baseline, after the 2nd cycle of treatment, and when progressive
      disease (PD) was evaluated. Samples were categorized into four levels according
      to the number of ctDNA alterations: level 1 (no alterations), level 2 (1-2
      alterations), level 3 (3-4 alterations) and level 4 (>/=5 alterations). According
      to ctDNA alteration level and variant allele frequency (VAF), a novel ctDNA-level
      Response Evaluation Criterion in Solid Tumors (ctle-RECIST) was established to
      assess treatment response and predict progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS:
      The median PFS in level 1 (6.63 months) patients was significantly longer than
      that in level 2-4 patients (level 2: 5.70 months; level 3-4: 4.90 months, p <
      0.05). After 2 cycles of treatment, based on ctle-RECIST, the median PFS of
      level-based disease control rate (lev-DCR) patients was significantly longer than
      that of level-based PD (lev-PD) patients [HR 2.42 (1.52-3.85), p < 0.001]. In
      addition, we found that ctDNA level assessment could be a good supplement to
      radiologic assessment. The median PFS in the dual-DCR group tended to be longer
      than that in the single-DCR group [HR 1.41 (0.93-2.13), p = 0.107]. CONCLUSION:
      The ctDNA alteration level and ctle-RECIST could be novel biomarkers of prognosis
      and could complement radiologic assessment in MBC.

TI  - PCDH7 knockdown potentiates colon cancer cells to chemotherapy via inducing
      ferroptosis and changes in autophagy through restraining MEK1/2/ERK/c-Fos axis.
LID - 10.1139/bcb-2021-0513 [doi]
AB  - Chemotherapy is a commonly utilized treatment strategy for colon cancer, a
      prevalent malignancy. The study intends to probe the function and mechanism of
      protocadherin 7 (PCDH7) in colon cancer. Gain- or loss- of functional assays of
      PCDH7 were performed. MTT and colony formation assay monitored cell
      proliferation. Transwell measured migration and invasion. qRT-PCR and western
      blot verified the profiles of PCDH7 and the MEK1/2/ERK/c-FOS pathway. Western
      blot was implemented to confirm the profiles of PP1alpha, MLC2, and p-MLC2 for
      evaluating the impact of PCDH7 on homotypic cells in cell (hocic) structures.
      Further, an in-vivo nude mouse model was engineered to figure out the function
      and mechanism of PCDH7 in tumor cell growth. As indicated by the data, PCDH7
      knockdown boosted the cells' sensitivity to chemotherapy. PCDH7 overexpression
      facilitated their proliferation and invasion, altered autophagy, induced
      ferroptosis, and hocic, and initiated the profile of the MEK1/2/ERK/c-FOS
      pathway. MEK1/2/ERK inhibition impaired the inhibitory impact of PCDH7 on colon
      cancer cells' chemotherapy sensitivity and dampened its pro-cancer function in
      the cells. In-vivo experiments displayed that PCDH7 overexpression stepped up
      tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis in colon cancer cells. All in all, the
      research has discovered that PCDH7 knockdown affects autophagy and induces
      ferroptosis, hence strengthening colon cancer cells' sensitivity to chemotherapy 
      by repressing the MEK1/2/ERK/c-FOS axis.

TI  - Photochemical Alkene Hydrophosphination with Bis(trichlorosilyl)phosphine.
LID - 10.1021/jacs.2c05248 [doi]
AB  - Bis(trichlorosilyl)phosphine (HP(SiCl3)2, 1) was prepared from [TBA][P(SiCl3)2]
      ([TBA]2, TBA = tetra-n-butylammonium) and triflic acid in 36% yield. Phosphine 1 
      is an efficient reagent for hydrophosphination of unactivated terminal olefins
      under UV irradiation (15-60 min) and gives rise to
      bis(trichlorosilyl)alkylphosphines (RP(SiCl3)2, R = (CH2)5CH3, 88%; (CH2)7CH3,
      98%; (CH2)2C(CH3)3, 76%; CH2Cy, 93%; (CH2)2Cy, 95%; CH2CH(CH3)(CH2)2CH3, 82%;
      (CH2)3O(CH2)3CH3, 95%; (CH2)3Cl, 83%; (CH2)2SiMe3, 92%; (CH2)5C(H)CH2, 44%) in
      excellent yields. The products require no further purification beyond filtration 
      and removal of volatile material under reduced pressure. The P-Si bonds of
      prototypical products RP(SiCl3)2 (R = -(CH2)5CH3, -(CH2)7CH3) are readily
      functionalized to give further phosphorus-containing products: H3C(CH2)7PCl2
      (56%), [H3C(CH2)5P(CH2Ph)3]Br (84%), H3C(CH2)7PH2 (61%), H3C(CH2)5P(O)(H)(OH)
      (81%), and H3C(CH2)5P(O)(OH)2 (55%). Experimental mechanistic investigations,
      accompanied by quantum chemical calculations, point toward a radical-chain
      mechanism. Phosphine 1 enables the fast, high-yielding, and atom-efficient
      preparation of compounds that contain phosphorus-carbon bonds in procedures that 
      bypass white phosphorus (P4), a toxic and high-energy intermediate of the
      phosphorus industry.

TI  - Association of Progestogens and Venous Thromboembolism Among Women of
      Reproductive Age.
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000004896 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between use of seven progestogens and
      incident acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) among women of reproductive age.
      METHODS: This nested matched case-control study identified women aged 15-49 years
      from January 1, 2010, through October 8, 2018, in the IBM MarketScan databases, a
      nationwide sample of private insurance claims in the United States. After
      exclusions, 21,405 women with incident acute VTE (case group), identified by
      diagnosis codes, were matched 1:5 by year of birth and index date through risk
      set sampling to 107,025 women without prior VTE (control group). From lowest to
      highest systemic dose based on a modified hierarchy, progestogens studied were
      levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD), oral norethindrone,
      etonogestrel implant, oral progesterone, oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, oral
      norethindrone acetate, and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). Conditional 
      logistic regression models adjusted for 16 VTE risk factors were used to estimate
      odds ratios and 99% CIs for incident acute VTE associated with current
      progestogen use compared with nonuse. The primary analysis treated each
      progestogen as a binary exposure. Dose, which varied for oral formulations, and
      chronicity were explored separately. Significance was set at P<.01 to allow for
      multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Current use of higher-dose progestogens was
      significantly associated with increased odds of VTE compared with nonuse (oral
      norethindrone acetate: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.00, 99% CI 1.96-4.59; DMPA:
      aOR 2.37, 99% CI 1.95-2.88; and oral medroxyprogesterone acetate: aOR 1.98, 99%
      CI 1.41-2.80). Current use of other progestogens was not significantly different 
      from nonuse (LNG-IUD, etonogestrel implant, and oral progesterone) or had reduced
      odds of VTE (oral norethindrone). Sensitivity analyses that assessed
      misclassification bias supported the primary findings. CONCLUSION: Among
      reproductive-aged women using one of seven progestogens, only use of
      norethindrone acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate-considered higher-dose
      progestogens-was significantly associated with increased odds of incident acute
      VTE. The roles of progestogen type, dose, and indication for use warrant further 
      study.

TI  - Cervical Dilators Used Concurrently With Misoprostol to Shorten Labor in
      Second-Trimester Termination of Pregnancy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000004887 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of cervical dilators concurrently with misoprostol
      to shorten labor in second-trimester medical termination of pregnancy. METHODS:
      This multicenter randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of cervical
      dilators inserted concurrently with misoprostol with that of misoprostol, alone, 
      to shorten labor for women undergoing termination of pregnancy between 15 0/7 and
      27 6/7 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome was the proportion of women with a
      duration of labor exceeding 12 hours. Secondary outcomes included median duration
      of labor, time to amniotomy, side effects, complications, NPRS (Numeric Pain
      Rating Scale) score, and women's distress as measured by the IES-R (Impact of
      Event Scale-Revised). These outcomes also were studied separately in the
      nulliparous subgroup. To demonstrate a reduction of 50% of the proportion of
      women with a duration of labor exceeding 12 hours in the dilator group, with a
      power of 80% and a 2-sided 0.05 significance level, a sample of 268 women (134 in
      each group) was required. RESULTS: Between December 2017 and September 2019, this
      study enrolled and analyzed 347 women: 174 in the dilator group and 173 in the
      control group, including 87 and 93 nulliparous patients, respectively.
      Sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between groups. The
      proportion of women with labor exceeding 12 hours was not different between
      groups (49/174 [28.2%] in the dilator group vs 53/173 [30.6%] in the control
      group [P=.61] for the whole population, and 37/87 [42.5%] vs 42/93 [45.2%]
      [P=.72], respectively, among nulliparous patients). Median duration of labor was 
      8.5 hours in the dilator group compared with 9.2 hours in the control group
      (P=.65) for the whole population, and 10.5 hours compared with 11.8 hours,
      respectively, among nulliparous patients (P=.33). Median time to amniotomy was
      3.6 hours in the dilator group compared with 5.0 hours in the control group
      (P=.08) for the whole population, and 3.5 hours compared with 6.7 hours,
      respectively, among nulliparous patients (P=.003). Side effects, complications,
      NPRS score, and IES-R score were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: Cervical
      dilators inserted concurrently with misoprostol did not reduce the proportion of 
      women whose labor exceeded 12 hours compared with misoprostol alone. CLINICAL

TI  - Trial of Labor Compared With Elective Cesarean Delivery for Low-Lying Placenta.
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000004890 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of women with low-lying placenta by planned mode
      of delivery and distance from the internal os distance. METHODS: Six tertiary
      maternity hospitals in France participated in this retrospective multicenter
      study of births from 2007-2012. Women with low-lying placenta, defined as an
      internal os distance of 20 mm or less, who gave birth after 35 weeks of gestation
      were included and classified in the planned trial-of-labor or elective cesarean
      delivery groups. The primary endpoint was severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)
      defined as blood loss exceeding 1,000 mL. Secondary outcomes were composite
      variables of severe maternal and neonatal morbidity. We used multivariable
      logistic regression and propensity scores to compare outcomes by planned mode of 
      delivery. RESULTS: Among 128,233 births during the study period, 171 (0.13%)
      women had low-lying placenta: 70 (40.9%) in the trial-of-labor group and 101
      (59.1%) who underwent elective cesarean delivery. The rate of severe PPH was
      22.9% (16/70, 95% CI 13.7-34.4) for the trial-of-labor group and 23.0% (23/101,
      95% CI 15.2-32.5) for the cesarean delivery group (P=.9); severe maternal and
      neonatal morbidity rates were likewise similar (2.9% vs 2.0% [P=.7] and 12.9% vs 
      9.9% [P=.5], respectively). Trial-of-labor was not significantly associated with 
      a higher rate of severe PPH after multivariable logistic regression and
      propensity score-weighted analysis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.42, 95% CI
      0.62-3.24 [P=.4]; and aOR 1.34, 95% CI 0.53-3.38 [P=.5], respectively). The
      vaginal delivery rate in the trial-of-labor group was 50.0% (19/38) in those with
      an internal os distance of 11-20 mm and 18.5% (5/27) in those with a distance of 
      1-10 mm. CONCLUSION: Our results support a policy of offering a trial of labor to
      women with low-lying placenta after 35 weeks of gestation and an internal os
      distance of 11-20 mm. An internal os distance of 1-10 mm reduces the likelihood
      of vaginal birth considerably, compared with 11-20 mm, but without increasing the
      incidence of severe PPH or severe maternal morbidity.

TI  - Containment Bag Use Among Women Who Undergo Hysterectomy With Laparoscopic Power 
      Morcellation.
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000004886 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate trends in use of laparoscopic power morcellators in women 
      undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy and to examine use of containment
      systems in these patients in relation to safety guidance from the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: We examined data that were recorded in the
      Premier Healthcare Database from patients who underwent laparoscopic
      supracervical hysterectomy from 2010 to 2018. Patients were stratified based on
      use of laparoscopic power morcellators. The cohort was further stratified as
      either pre-FDA guidance (2010 quarter 1-2014 quarter 1) or post-FDA guidance
      (2014 quarter 2-2018 quarter 2). Interrupted time series analyses were performed 
      to determine the effect of FDA guidance on the use of laparoscopic power
      morcellators and containment bags. RESULTS: Among 67,115 patients, laparoscopic
      power morcellator use decreased from 66.7% in 2013 quarter 4 to 13.3% by 2018
      quarter 2. The likelihood of laparoscopic power morcellator use decreased by 9.5%
      for each quarter elapsed in the post-FDA warning period (risk ratio [RR] 0.91,
      95% CI 0.90-0.91). Containment bag use rose from 5.2% in 2013 quarter 4 to 15.2% 
      by 2018 quarter 2. The likelihood of containment bag use increased by 3% for each
      quarter elapsed in the post-FDA warning period (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.05). Among
      women who had laparoscopic power morcellator use, uterine cancers or sarcomas
      were identified in 54 (0.17%) before the FDA guidance compared with seven (0.12%)
      after the guidance (P=.45). Containment bags were used in 11.1% of women with
      uterine cancers or sarcomas before the FDA guidance compared with 14.3% after the
      guidance (P=.12). The perioperative complication rate was 3.3% among women who
      had laparoscopic power morcellator use without a containment bag compared with
      4.5% (P=.001) in those with a containment bag (aRR 1.35, 95% CI 1.12-1.64).
      CONCLUSION: Use of laparoscopic power morcellators has decreased over time.
      Containment bag use increased after the FDA's 2014 guidance; however, most
      procedures employing laparoscopic power morcellators are still performed without 
      a containment bag.

TI  - Addition of External Beam Radiation Therapy to Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Patients
      with Stage IIIC Uterine Endometrioid Carcinoma: Utilization and Outcomes.
LID - 10.1097/COC.0000000000000927 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluate whether the addition of external beam radiation (EBRT) to
      adjuvant chemotherapy with or without vaginal brachytherapy is associated with
      better survival for patients with stage IIIC endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 with apparent
      early-stage endometrioid adenocarcinoma, without a history of another tumor, who 
      underwent hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy and had positive lymph nodes were
      identified in the National Cancer Database. Those who received adjuvant
      chemotherapy (defined as receipt of treatment within 6 mo from surgery) and had
      at least 1 month of follow-up were selected for further analysis. Overall
      survival was compared between patients who did and did not receive EBRT within 6 
      months from surgery with the log-rank test. A Cox model was also constructed to
      control for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 3116 patients were identified; 1458 
      (46.8%) received chemotherapy without and 1658 (53.2%) with EBRT. Pathologic
      characteristics (tumor grade, size, endocervical, and lymph-vascular invasion)
      were comparable between the two groups. Patients who received external beam
      radiation had better survival compared with those who did not, P=0.001; 5-year
      overall survival rates were 83.1% and 77.9%, respectively. After controlling for 
      patient age, race, presence of comorbidities, insurance status, tumor size, grade
      and endocervical invasion, and the presence of lymph-vascular invasion, the
      addition of EBRT was associated with a survival benefit (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62, 
      0.91). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma metastatic to
      the lymph nodes, addition of external beam radiation to adjuvant chemotherapy may
      be associated with a survival benefit.

TI  - Content and Quality of Online Videos About Ostomy Pouch Changes: A Descriptive
      Study.
PG  - 25-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many health-related videos are available online. One type of
      health-related video is related to stoma pouch change. However, a system to
      evaluate the quality and content of these videos is lacking. PURPOSE: To evaluate
      the content and quality of YouTube videos on colostomy pouch change. METHODS: A
      descriptive study was carried out by searching for videos on March 15, 2021,
      using the key words "colostomy care," "colostomy bag/pouch change," and "ostomy
      bag/pouch change." A 5-point Global Quality Scale was used to evaluate the
      quality of the videos, and a 10-point scale was used to evaluate the content. The
      videos were classified as "useful" or "useless" according to their content and
      quality scores. RESULTS: A total of 128 videos were found; 94 videos met the
      criteria and were included in the study. The content of the 94 videos was
      examined by 2 independent researchers. The overall content score of the videos
      was 8.24 +/- 1.56, and the overall quality score was 3.14 +/- 0.97. A total of 66
      (70.21%) videos were useful, and 28 (29.79%) videos were useless. The mean scores
      of useful videos for content (9.09 +/- 0.83) and the average Global Quality Scale
      scores (3.53 +/- 0.76) were significantly higher than those of useless videos
      (6.17 +/- 0.90 and 2.25 +/- 0.75, respectively; (P < .05). The results showed
      that 57.6% of the useful videos were uploaded by universities, professional
      organizations, and health care professionals, and 67.9% of the useless videos
      were uploaded by patients; the difference was statistically significant (P <
      .05). CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that the majority of online videos evaluated
      were accurate. Most of these videos were uploaded by universities, professional
      organizations, health care professionals, or medical advertisers. Although there 
      were many limitations to this study, the authors suggest that health care
      professionals can direct their patients to these sources after hospital
      discharge. However, future studies are needed..

TI  - Safety and Effectiveness of Moxibustion and Abdominal Massage in Hospitalized
      Older Patients With Constipation: A Retrospective Study.
PG  - 16-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence about moxibustion and abdominal massage for treating
      constipation in older hospitalized patients is limited. PURPOSE: To investigate
      the safety and effectiveness of moxibustion and abdominal massage in hospitalized
      older patients with constipation. METHODS: Hospitalized older patients (age >/=60
      years) with constipation were retrospectively categorized as 2 cohorts according 
      to whether the patients received moxibustion and abdominal massage in addition to
      routine nursing care. Gastrointestinal symptoms, Constipation Assessment Scale
      (CAS) scores, and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scores were compared before
      and after treatment between cohorts. RESULTS: The 2 cohorts (n = 100 for each)
      had similar baseline characteristics and gastrointestinal symptoms; the control
      cohort and the additional intervention cohort also had similar CAS scores (7.14
      +/- 3.67 vs 7.48 +/- 2.96, respectively), and GDS scores (>17: 31% vs 29%,
      respectively). Improvement in the 2 scores from baseline was observed after 2
      weeks in both the control cohort and the additional intervention cohort (CAS,
      5.37 +/- 5.34 and 3.80 +/- 4.47, respectively; GDS, >17: 28% and 15%,
      respectively). The cohort with additional interventions had a lower ineffective
      rate (defined as persistent symptoms or absence of decrease in CAS, 49% vs 32%; P
      = .028) but had more diarrhea (9% vs 21%; P = .017). CONCLUSION: Moxibustion and 
      abdominal massage may help relieve constipation in hospitalized elderly patients,
      but attention should be paid to the increased occurrence of diarrhea. More study 
      is needed.

TI  - NTO Degradation by Nitroreductase: A DFT Study.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c04153 [doi]
AB  - NTO (5-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-3-one), an energetic material used in military
      applications, may be released to the environment during manufacturing,
      transportation, storage, training, and disposal. A detailed investigation of the 
      possible mechanism for all steps of reduction of NTO by oxygen-insensitive
      nitroreductase, as one of the pathways for NTO environmental degradation, was
      performed by computational study at the PCM(Pauling)/M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level. 
      Obtained results reveal an overall sequence for NTO transformation into ATO
      (5-amino-1,2,4-triazol-3-one) with the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor of
      nitroreductase. Reduction of the nitro group to the nitroso group and the nitroso
      group to the hydroxylamino group follow a similar mechanism that consists of the 
      sequential electron and proton transfer from the flavin cofactor. The hydride
      transfer mechanism may contribute to reduction of the nitroso group by the
      anionic form of the reduced flavin cofactor. Reduction of
      5-(hydroxylamino)-1,2,4-triazol-3-one by the neutral form of the reduced flavin
      is impossible, whereas reduction of the hydroxylamino group to the amino group
      occurs with the anionic form of the reduced cofactor by a mechanism involving an 
      initial proton transfer from the hydroxonium ion followed by two electrons and
      one proton transfers from the flavin cofactor. Small activation energies and high
      exothermicity support the significant contribution of oxygen-insensitive
      nitroreductase and other enzymes, containing FMN as a cofactor, to NTO
      degradation in the environment.

TI  - Evolution of Clinical Complexity, Treatment Burden, Health Care Use, and
      Diabetes-Related Outcomes Among Commercial and Medicare Advantage Plan
      Beneficiaries With Diabetes in the U.S., 2006-2018.
LID - dc212623 [pii]
LID - 10.2337/dc21-2623 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize trends in clinical complexity, treatment burden,
      health care use, and diabetes-related outcomes among adults with diabetes.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a nationwide claims database to identify
      enrollees in commercial and Medicare Advantage plans who met claims criteria for 
      diabetes between 1 January 2006 and 31 March 2019 and to quantify annual trends
      in clinical complexity (e.g., active health conditions), treatment burden (e.g., 
      medications), health care use (e.g., ambulatory, emergency department [ED], and
      hospital visits), and diabetes-related outcomes (e.g., hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]
      levels) between 2006 and 2018. RESULTS: Among 1,470,799 commercially insured
      patients, the proportion with >/=10 active health conditions increased from 33.3%
      (95% CI 33.1-33.4) in 2006 to 38.9% (38.8-39.1) in 2018 (P = 0.001) and the
      proportion taking three or more glucose-lowering medications increased from 11.6%
      (11.5-11.7) to 23.1% (22.9-23.2) (P = 0.007). The proportion with HbA1c >/=8.0%
      (>/=64 mmol/mol) increased from 28.0% (27.7-28.3) in 2006 to 30.5% (30.2-30.7) in
      2015, decreasing to 27.8% (27.5-28.0) in 2018 (overall trend P = 0.04). Number of
      ambulatory visits per patient per year decreased from 6.86 (6.84-6.88) to 6.19
      (6.17-6.21), (P = 0.001) while ED visits increased from 0.26 (0.257-0.263) to
      0.29 (0.287-0.293) (P = 0.001). Among 1,311,903 Medicare Advantage enrollees, the
      proportion with >/=10 active conditions increased from 51.6% (51.2-52.0) to 65.1%
      (65.0-65.2) (P < 0.001); the proportion taking three or more glucose-lowering
      medications was stable at 16.6% (16.3-16.9) and 18.1% (18.0-18.2) (P = 0.98), and
      the proportion with HbA1c >/=8.0% increased from 17.4% (16.7-18.1) to 18.6%
      (18.4-18.7) (P = 0.008). Ambulatory visits per patient per year remained stable
      at 8.01 (7.96-8.06) and 8.17 (8.16-8.19) (P = 0.23), but ED visits increased from
      0.41 (0.40-0.42) to 0.66 (0.66-0.66) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients
      with diabetes, clinical complexity and treatment burden have increased over time.
      ED utilization has also increased, and patients may be using ED services for low 
      acuity conditions.

TI  - Heterogeneity of Lung Function Phenotypes in Sarcoidosis: Role of Race and Sex
      Differences.
LID - 10.1513/AnnalsATS.202204-328OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Historically sarcoidosis was described as a restrictive lung disease, 
      but several alternative phenotypes of pulmonary function have been observed.
      Pulmonary function phenotypes in sarcoidosis may represent different clinical
      and/or molecular phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the prevalence of
      different pulmonary function phenotypes in a large and diverse sarcoidosis cohort
      from a tertiary care referral center. METHODS: We identified individuals seen
      between 2005-2015 with a confirmed diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Data were collected 
      from the first pulmonary function test (PFT) performed at our institution which
      included spirometry and diffusing capacity (DLCO). Demographics and clinical data
      were collected. Chi-squared analyses and multiple linear regressions were done to
      assess statistical differences and associations. Global Lung Function Initiative 
      equations were used to calculate percent predicted measurements for spirometry
      and DLCO. RESULTS: Of 602 individuals with sarcoidosis, 93% (562) had pulmonary
      involvement, 64% (385) were female, and 57% (341) were Black. Of those with
      pulmonary involvement, 56% had abnormal pulmonary function. Lung function
      impairment phenotypes included: 47% restriction, 22% obstruction, 15% isolated
      reduction in DLCO, and 16% combined obstructive restrictive phenotype.
      Restriction was the most common PFT phenotype among Black individuals (41%),
      while no lung impairment was most common among White individuals (66%) (p<0.001).
      Males more frequently had obstruction (19%) compared to females (9%) p=0.001, and
      females had more restriction (30%) compared to males (21%) p=0.031. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Among individuals with sarcoidosis and pulmonary function impairment, less than
      half demonstrated a restrictive phenotype. There were significant differences in 
      pulmonary function phenotypes by race and sex.

TI  - Panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In: An Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Targeted
      Theranostic for SPECT/CT Imaging and Meitner-Auger Electron Radioimmunotherapy of
      Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.2c00457 [doi]
AB  - Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) are overexpressed in triple-negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) and are an attractive target for the development of
      theranostic radiopharmaceuticals. We studied anti-EGFR panitumumab labeled with
      (111)In (panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In) for SPECT/CT imaging and Meitner-Auger
      electron (MAE) radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of TNBC. Panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In was
      bound, internalized, and routed to the nucleus in MCF7, MDA-MB-231/Luc, and
      MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer (BC) cells dependent on the EGFR expression level 
      (1.5 x 10(4), 1.7 x 10(5), or 1.3 x 10(6) EGFR/cell, respectively). The absorbed 
      dose in the nuclei of MCF7, MDA-MB-231/Luc, and MDA-MB-468 cells incubated with
      4.4 MBq of panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In (20 nM) was 1.20 +/- 0.02, 2.2 +/- 0.1, and
      25 +/- 2 Gy, respectively. The surviving fraction (SF) of MDA-MB-231/Luc cells
      treated with panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In (10-300 nM; 1.5 MBq/mug) was reduced as the
      absorbed dose in the cell increased, with clonogenic survival reduced to an SF = 
      0.12 +/- 0.05 at 300 nM corresponding to 12.7 Gy. The SFs of MDA-MB-468,
      MDA-MB-231/Luc, and MCF7 cells treated with panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In (20 nM; 1.7 
      MBq/mug) were <0.01, 0.56 +/- 0.05, and 0.67 +/- 0.04, respectively. Unlabeled
      panitumumab had no effect on SF, and irrelevant IgG-DOTA-(111)In only modestly
      reduced the SF of MDA-MB-231/Luc cells but not MCF7 or MDA-MB-468 cells. The
      cytotoxicity of panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In was mediated by increased DNA
      double-strand breaks (DSB), cell cycle arrest at G2/M-phase and apoptosis
      measured by immunofluorescence detection by flow cytometry. MDA-MB-231/Luc tumors
      in the mammary fat pad (MFP) of NRG mice were clearly imaged with
      panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In by microSPECT/CT at 4 days postinjection (p.i.), and
      biodistribution studies revealed high tumor uptake [18 +/- 2% injected dose/g (% 
      ID/g] and lower normal tissue uptake (<10% ID/g). Administration of up to 24 MBq 
      (15 mug) of panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In to healthy NRG mice caused no major
      hematological, renal, or hepatic toxicity with no decrease in body weight.
      Treatment of NOD SCID mice with MDA-MB-231 tumors with panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In
      (22 MBq; 15 mug) slowed tumor growth. The mean time for tumors to reach a volume 
      of >/=500 mm(3) was 61 +/- 5 days for RIT with panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In compared 
      to 42 +/- 6 days for mice treated with irrelevant IgG2-DOTA-(111)In (P < 0.0001) 
      and 35 +/- 3 days for mice receiving 0.9% NaCl (P < 0.0001). However, tumors
      regrew at later time points. The median survival of mice treated with
      panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In was 70 days versus 46 days for IgG2-DOTA-(111)In (P <
      0.0001) or 40 days for 0.9% NaCl (P < 0.0001). We conclude that
      panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In is a promising theranostic agent for TNBC. Increasing
      the administered amount of panitumumab-DOTA-(111)In and/or combination with
      radiosensitizing PARP inhibitors used for treatment of patients with TNBC may
      provide a more durable response to RIT.

TI  - The relationship of masseter muscle thickness with face morphology and
      parafunctional habits: AN ultrasound study.
PG  - 20220166
LID - 10.1259/dmfr.20220166 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the normal range of masseter
      muscle thickness by ultrasonographic measurement in individuals over 15 years of 
      age, and to evaluate its relationship with age, gender, facial morphology, body
      mass index and parafunctional habits. METHODS: The study was conducted on 115
      volunteers whose lateral cephalometric radiography was performed within the
      indication in Gazi University Faculty of Dentistry, Department of
      Dentomaxillofacial Radiology. The participants in the study were asked questions 
      about their parafunctional habits, age, height and weight. Individuals were
      grouped as hypodivergent (n = 28), normdivergent (n = 55), or hyperdivergent (n =
      32) according to vertical face morphology by making measurements on lateral
      cephalometric films. Right and left masseter muscle thicknesses of individuals
      were measured by ultrasonography while at rest and in contraction. RESULTS: The
      mean value of masseter muscle thickness was found to be 13.57 +/- 2.57 mm. The
      rest and contracted muscle thicknesses were significantly higher in males than in
      females for the right and left masseter muscles (p < 0.05). When the masseter
      muscle was at rest and contracted, its thickness was higher in individuals with
      hypodivergent facial morphology, than in the other groups. No statistically
      significant difference was found in terms of masseter muscle thickness between
      individuals having parafunctional habits and those who did not have
      parafunctional habits (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although masseter muscle thickness 
      varied according to vertical facial morphology, this was not the case for
      parafunctional habits.

TI  - Middle mesial root canals in mandibular molars: prevalence and correlation to
      anatomical aspects based on CBCT imaging.
PG  - 20220156
LID - 10.1259/dmfr.20220156 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of Middle Mesial Root Canal (MMC) in a
      Brazilian subpopulation, verify whether its presence is related to anatomical
      characteristics of the tooth, and propose a classification using cone-beam
      computed tomography (CBCT). METHODS: CBCT scans of 284 patients were evaluated by
      two radiologists to determine the presence of the MMC in mandibular first and
      second molars. Subsequently, the mesio-distal and buccal-lingual measurements of 
      the mesial roots were obtained; the measurements between the root canals, and
      from MMC to the mesiobuccal canal and to the mesiolingual canal were also
      obtained. The MMC was classified according to its relationship with mesiobuccal
      and mesiolingual canals. The data were analyzed using chi-square and Fisher's
      exact test, Multiple Logistic Regression analysis, Student's t-test, kappa and
      Intraclass correlation coefficient (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The intra examiner
      agreements for the presence of the MMC and the measurements were considered
      almost perfect (0.953 and 0.999, respectively). Of 216 mandibular first molars,
      11.1% had the MMC, and of 228 mandibular second molars, only 1.75% had the MMC.
      The presence was significant higher in the mandibular first molar (p < 0.0001).
      The buccal-lingual measurement and the measurement between mesiobuccal and
      mesiolingual canals were higher in teeth with MMC (p = 0.024 and p = 0.005,
      respectively). It was possible to classify the configuration of MCC into four
      types: Independent (60.7%) Confluent (14.3%), Mesiolingual confluent (14.3%), and
      Mesiobuccal confluent (10.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MMC is more
      pronounced in mandibular first molars and anatomical measurements, such as
      greater measurement between mesiobuccal and mesiolingual canals, may alert
      clinicians to its presence. It was found 4 types of configurations of MMC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of complicated surgical wounds and its
      related factors in hospitalized adults. METHOD: In this cross-sectional study,
      information from 251 patients hospitalized in seven public hospitals in Manaus,
      Brazil, and at risk of suffering surgical site complications after undergoing
      surgery was analyzed. Data were collected via interviews, physical examinations, 
      and a medical record review from March to June 2015. Prevalence rate was
      estimated as the ratio between individuals with complications and patients at
      risk. To explore associated variables, individuals with and without complications
      were compared via 5% significant logistic regression and bivariate analyses. This
      study was approved by a research ethics committee. RESULTS: Overall, 15 patients 
      (6%) showed complicated surgical wounds. General hospitalization (p < 0.003),
      presence of ecchymosis, (p < 0.001), and men (p = 0.047) increased patients'
      probability of developing complications in 13.9, 10.1, and 8.2 times,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Assessing the prevalence of complicated surgical wounds
      and its associated factors in adults contributes to their epidemiological
      understanding, highlighting prevention targets and making data available for
      scientific comparisons.

TI  - Optimized Camera-Based Patient Positioning in CT: Impact on Radiation Exposure.
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000904 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a 3-dimensional (3D)
      camera can outperform highly trained technicians in precision of patient
      positioning and whether this transforms into a reduction in patient exposure.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a single-center study, 3118 patients underwent computer
      tomography (CT) scans of the chest and/or abdomen on a latest generation
      single-source CT scanner supported with an automated patient positioning system
      by 3D camera. One thousand five hundred fifty-seven patients were positioned
      laser-guided by a highly trained radiographer (camera off) and 1561 patients with
      3D camera (camera on) guidance. Radiation parameters such as effective dose,
      organ doses, CT dose index, and dose length product were analyzed and compared.
      Isocenter accuracy and table height were evaluated between the 2 groups. RESULTS:
      Isocenter positioning was significantly improved with the 3D camera (P < 0.001)
      as compared with visual laser-guided positioning. Absolute table height differed 
      significantly (P < 0.001), being higher with camera positioning (165.6 +/- 16.2
      mm) as compared with laser-guided positioning (170.0 +/- 20.4 mm). Radiation
      exposure decreased using the 3D camera as indicated by dose length product (321.1
      +/- 266.6 mGy.cm; camera off: 342.0 +/- 280.7 mGy.cm; P = 0.033), effective dose 
      (3.3 +/- 2.7 mSv; camera off: 3.5 +/- 2.9; P = 0.053), and CT dose index (6.4 +/-
      4.3 mGy; camera off: 6.8 +/- 4.6 mGy; P = 0.011). Exposure of radiation-sensitive
      organs such as colon (P = 0.015) and red bone marrow (P = 0.049) were also lower 
      using the camera. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of a 3D camera improves patient
      positioning in the isocenter of the scanner, which results in a lower and also
      better balanced dose reduction for the patients.

TI  - Single-cell RNA sequencing of Plasmodium vivax sporozoites reveals stage- and
      species-specific transcriptomic signatures.
PG  - e0010633
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax sporozoites reside in the salivary glands of a
      mosquito before infecting a human host and causing malaria. Previous
      transcriptome-wide studies in populations of these parasite forms were limited in
      their ability to elucidate cell-to-cell variation, thereby masking cellular
      states potentially important in understanding malaria transmission outcomes.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we performed transcription
      profiling on 9,947 P. vivax sporozoites to assess the extent to which they differ
      at single-cell resolution. We show that sporozoites residing in the mosquito's
      salivary glands exist in distinct developmental states, as defined by their
      transcriptomic signatures. Additionally, relative to P. falciparum, P. vivax
      displays overlapping and unique gene usage patterns, highlighting conserved and
      species-specific gene programs. Notably, distinguishing P. vivax from P.
      falciparum were a subset of P. vivax sporozoites expressing genes associated with
      translational regulation and repression. Finally, our comparison of single-cell
      transcriptomic data from P. vivax sporozoite and erythrocytic forms reveals gene 
      usage patterns unique to sporozoites. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In defining the
      transcriptomic signatures of individual P. vivax sporozoites, our work provides
      new insights into the factors driving their developmental trajectory and lays the
      groundwork for a more comprehensive P. vivax cell atlas.

AB  - Meiosis, at the transition between diploid and haploid life cycle phases, is
      accompanied by reprograming of cell division machinery and followed by a
      transition back to mitosis. We show that, in Arabidopsis, this transition is
      driven by inhibition of translation, achieved by a mechanism that involves
      processing bodies (P-bodies). During the second meiotic division, the
      meiosis-specific protein THREE-DIVISION MUTANT 1 (TDM1) is incorporated into
      P-bodies through interaction with SUPPRESSOR WITH MORPHOGENETIC EFFECTS ON
      GENITALIA 7 (SMG7). TDM1 attracts eIF4F, the main translation initiation complex,
      temporarily sequestering it in P-bodies and inhibiting translation. The failure
      of tdm1 mutants to terminate meiosis can be overcome by chemical inhibition of
      translation. We propose that TDM1-containing P-bodies down-regulate expression of
      meiotic transcripts to facilitate transition of cell fates to postmeiotic
      gametophyte differentiation.

TI  - Evaluation of serum uric acid and liver function tests among pregnant women with 
      and without preeclampsia at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized
      Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.
PG  - e0272165
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272165 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia can be described as new-onset hypertension (blood
      pressure >/=140/90 mmHg) together with proteinuria (24-hr urinary protein >/= 0.3
      g) or any indication of end-organ damage after 20 weeks of gestation. Liver and
      kidney dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary edema, and neurologic dysfunction
      are common manifestations of end-organ damage due to pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia
      is the most common cause of liver and kidney dysfunction due to hypoxia and
      endothelial dysfunction. Hyperuricemia indicates kidney dysfunction and is
      considered a predictor of the severity of preeclampsia. Therefore, the objective 
      of this study is to evaluate the utility of the levels of serum uric acid and
      liver function tests [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST)] as biomarkers of preeclampsia-related organ damage.
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: An institutional-based comparative cross-sectional study
      design was conducted, and a total of 102 subjects (51 patients with preeclampsia 
      and 51 normotensive pregnant women) were recruited. The parameters measured were 
      levels of serum uric acid and liver function tests. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There
      were statistically significant differences in the mean serum uric acid, ALT, and 
      AST levels between preeclamptic pregnant women and normotensive pregnant women
      (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the mean total
      and direct bilirubin levels. There was also a significant difference in mean
      serum uric acid, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase levels across
      different gestational age categories. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that serum
      uric acid, ALT, and AST levels were higher in pre-eclamptic pregnant women
      compared to those of normotensive pregnant women, and the differences were
      statistically significant. As such, serum uric acid and liver function tests may 
      be considered biomarkers of pre-eclampsia-related end-organ damage.

TI  - A tele-health primary care rehabilitation program improves self-perceived
      exertion in COVID-19 survivors experiencing Post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea: A
      quasi-experimental study.
PG  - e0271802
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271802 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that up to 70% of COVID-19 survivors
      develop post-COVID symptoms during the following months after infection. Fatigue 
      and dyspnea seem to be the most prevalent post-COVID symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To
      analyze whether a tele-rehabilitation exercise program is able to improve
      self-perceived physical exertion in patients with post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea.
      METHODS: Sixty-eight COVID-19 survivors exhibiting post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea
      derived to four Primary Health Care centers located in Madrid were enrolled in
      this quasi-experimental study. A tele-rehabilitation program based on patient
      education, physical activity, airway clearing, and breathing exercise
      interventions was structured on eighteen sessions (3 sessions/week).
      Self-perceived physical exertion during daily living activities, dyspnea
      severity, health-related quality of life and distance walked and changes in
      oxygen saturation and heart rate during the 6-Minute walking test were assessed
      at baseline, after the program and at 1- and 3-months follow-up periods. RESULTS:
      Daily living activities, dyspnea severity and quality of life improved
      significantly at all follow-ups (p<0.001). Additionally, a significant increase
      in oxygen saturation before and after the 6-Minute Walking test was found when
      compared with baseline (P<0.001). Heart rate adaptations at rest were found
      during the follow-up periods (P = 0.012). Lower perceived exertion before and
      after the 6-Minute Walking test were also observed, even if larger distance were 
      walked (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Tele-rehabilitation programs could be an effective 
      strategy to reduce post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea in COVID-19 survivors. In
      addition, it could also reduce the economic burden of acute COVID-19, reaching a 
      greater number of patients and releasing Intensive Unit Care beds for prioritized
      patients with a severe disease. STUDY REGISTRATION: The international OSF

AB  - Nigella sativa is one of the medicinal plant species that gained popularity for a
      wide range of medicinal applications due to its seeds which are rich in
      phytoconstituents. Continuous scientific investigations on N. sativa seeds are
      needed to better understand its many medicinal potentials. This will also form a 
      composition-based foundation that support several old and/or new case beneficial 
      histories of its seeds. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of N. sativa
      seeds was phytochemically characterized and evaluated. Different extracts of N.
      sativa seeds were obtained by maceration and soxhlet extraction methods using
      different extraction solvents. The obtained extracts were tested using UV-Vis,
      FTIR, TLC, and GC-MS techniques. Antimicrobial analysis against pathogenic
      bacterial strains (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis) was carried
      out by disc diffusion method using different preparations of N. sativa seeds. The
      screening analysis revealed the presence of all the tested phytochemicals. FT-IR 
      analysis of N. sativa seeds oil extracted with absolute ethanol revealed
      functional groups that are associated with active ingredients of medicinal value.
      The GC-MS chromatograms revealed different chemical constituents whose known
      bioactivities and/or applications are essential in the management of
      life-threatening infections. Different extracts of N. sativa seeds showed
      antimicrobial activity with different efficacy against the tested pathogenic
      bacterial strains. Therefore, this study shows that extracts of N. sativa seeds
      contain a variety of chemical components and functional groups linked to their
      antimicrobial properties, and they might be natural precursors of nutraceuticals.

      adolescent's health-related quality of life in eastern Ethiopia: A
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - e0272651
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272651 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to examine the association between mental health problems 
      and health-related quality of life (HrQoL) among in-school adolescents 13-19
      years in the Harari region, eastern Ethiopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      cross-sectional study was conducted on 3227 in-school adolescents aged 13 to 19
      using multistage sampling. The KIDSCREEN-10 questionnaire assessed health-related
      quality of life (HrQoL), while a self-administered version of the strength and
      difficulty questionnaire (SDQ) examined mental health issues. Data were double
      entered, validated, and cleaned using EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using
      STATA 14.1. An ordinal logistic regression model investigated the link between
      the outcome variable and the predictors. The results were reported using an odds 
      ratio with a 95% confidence interval (CI), and a p-value of less than 0.05 was
      considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A quarter of the adolescents (23%)
      reported poor health-related quality of life; adolescents with internalizing and 
      externalizing mental health problems had the lowest health-related quality of
      life. After controlling for potential confounders, adolescents with abnormal (AOR
      = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.59) and borderline (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.78)
      levels of internalizing problems had a 52% and 41% lower probability of having
      high HrQoL than those with normal levels. Furthermore, individuals with abnormal 
      (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.77) and borderline (AOR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.92) 
      levels of externalizing difficulties had a 41% and 36% lower chance of having a
      high health-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly a quarter of in-school
      adolescents had poor health-related quality of life. High scores for
      internalizing and externalizing mental health problems significantly impacted the
      adolescents' health-related quality of life. This emphasizes the need to address 
      mental health issues in the school setting to improve adolescents' overall
      quality of life.

AB  - Agricultural practice in adjusting planting density and harvest date are
      important factors for plant development and crop improvement, reaching maximum
      yields and enhancing the production of secondary metabolites. However, it is
      unclear as to the optimal planting densities during mass production that
      encourage consistent, high yield secondary metabolite content. For this,
      controlled environment, crop production facilities such as plant factories with
      artificial lighting (PFAL) offer opportunity to enhance quality and stabilize
      production of herbal plants. This study assessed the effect of plant density and 
      harvest date on physiological responses, yield and andrographolide (AP1) content 
      in Andrographis paniculata (Andrographis) using hydroponic conditions in a PFAL
      system. Andrographis, harvested at vegetative stage (30 days after transplanting;
      30 DAT) and initial stage of flowering (60 DAT) exhibited no significant
      differences in growth parameters or andrographolide accumulation according to
      planting densities. Harvest time at flowering stage (90 DAT) showed the highest
      photosynthetic rates at a planting density of 15 plants m-2. Highest yield,
      number of leaves, and Andrographolide (AP1) content (mg per gram of DW in m2)
      were achieved at a more moderate planting density (30 plants m-2). Finally, five 
      out of seventeen indices of leaf reflectance reveal high correlation (r = 0.8 to 
      1.0 and r = -0.8 to -1.0, P<0.01) with AP1 content. These results suggest that a 
      planting density of 30 plants m-2 and harvest time of 90 DAT provide optimal
      growing condition under the hydroponic PFAL system.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, yet heterogeneous, B-cell 
      lymphoproliferative disorder. Although most FL patients respond well to
      treatment, few with specific traits have a poor prognosis; the latter are
      difficult to define. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 
      143 FL patients treated at the University of Debrecen since 2009 and investigated
      prognostic factors that may influence the survival of FL patients. RESULTS: A
      maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) cut-off of 9.85 at the staging
      positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) (p = 0.0001, hazard
      ratio [HR]: 0.2535, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1118-0.4878) and a
      lymphocyte/monocyte (Ly/Mo) ratio of 3.41 (p = 0.0027, HR: 2.997, 95% CI:
      1.463-6.142), drawn at diagnosis, significantly predicted FL patients'
      progression-free survival (PFS). A staging SUVmax >9.85 with Ly/Mo <3.41 could
      delineate a high-risk group of FL patients (p<0.0001, HR: 0.0957, 95% CI:
      0.03416-0.2685). Similarly, a significant difference was shown with an SUVmax
      cut-off of 3.15 at the interim PET/CT (p<0.0001, HR: 0.1614, 95% CI:
      0.06684-0.3897). A staging SUVmax >9.85 in conjunction with interim SUVmax >3.15 
      predicted poor prognosis (p<0.0001, HR: 0.1037, 95% CI: 0.03811-0.2824). The PFS 
      difference was translated into overall survival (OS) advantage (p = 0.0506, HR:
      0.1187, 95% CI: 0.01401-1.005). CONCLUSION: Biological prognostic factors, such
      as the Ly/Mo ratio, may improve the prognostic assessment of staging PET/CT. The 
      survival advantage observed in PFS is translated into OS when determined using a 
      combination of staging and interim SUVmax. We recommend investigating additional 
      biological prognostic factors while highlighting the role of PET/CT in FL.

      prospective database analysis.
PG  - e0272232
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272232 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The Onodera's prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and the haemoglobin,
      albumin, lymphocyte and platelet (HALP) score are immune-nutritional indices that
      correlate with survival outcomes in several adult solid malignancies. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate whether PNI and HALP are associated with survival
      outcomes in endometrial cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women undergoing management
      for endometrial cancer were recruited to a single centre prospective cohort
      study. Pre-treatment PNI and HALP scores were computed for study participants and
      analysed as continuous variables and by selecting cut-off values based on
      previous publications. Both parameters were analysed in relation to overall,
      endometrial cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival using Kaplan-Meier
      estimation and multivariable Cox proportional regression. RESULTS: A total of 439
      women, with a median age of 67 years (interquartile range (IQR), 58, 74) and BMI 
      of 31kg/m2 (IQR 26, 37) were included in the analysis. Most had low-grade
      (63.3%), early-stage (84.4% stage I/II) endometrial cancer of endometrioid
      histological subtype (72.7%). Primary treatment was surgery in 98.2% of cases.
      Adjusted overall mortality hazard ratios for PNI and HALP as continuous variables
      were 0.97(95%CI 0.94-1.00, p = 0.136) and 0.99(95%CI 0.98-1.01, p = 0.368),
      respectively. Women with pre-treatment PNI >/=45 had a 45% decrease in both
      overall (adjusted HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.92, p = 0.022) and cancer-specific
      mortality risk (adjusted HR = 0.55, 95%CI 0.30-0.99, p = 0.048) compared to those
      with PNI <45. There was no evidence for an effect of PNI on recurrence free
      survival. HALP scores were associated with adverse clinico-pathologic factors,
      but not overall, cancer-specific or recurrence-free survival in the multivariable
      analysis. CONCLUSION: PNI is an independent prognostic factor in endometrial
      cancer and has the potential to refine pre-operative risk assessment.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272279 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vasoactive treatment is a cornerstone in treating hypoperfusion in
      cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction (AMICS). The purpose was 
      to compare the achievement of treatment targets and outcome in relation to
      vasoactive strategy in AMICS patients stratified according to the Society of
      Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) shock classification.
      METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with AMICS admitted to cardiac
      intensive care unit at two tertiary cardiac centers during 2010-2017 with
      retrieval of real-time hemodynamic data and dosages of vasoactive drugs from
      intensive care unit databases. RESULTS: Out of 1,249 AMICS patients classified
      into SCAI class C, D, and E, mortality increased for each shock stage from 34% to
      60%, and 82% (p<0.001). Treatment targets of mean arterial blood pressure >
      65mmHg and venous oxygen saturation > 55% were reached in the majority of
      patients; however, more patients in SCAI class D and E had values below treatment
      targets within 24 hours (p<0.001) despite higher vasoactive load and increased
      use of epinephrine for each severity stage (p<0.001). In univariate analysis no
      significant difference in mortality within SCAI class D and E regarding
      vasoactive strategy was observed, however in SCAI class C, epinephrine was
      associated with higher mortality and a significantly higher vasoactive load to
      reach treatment targets. In multivariate analysis there was no statistically
      association between individually vasoactive choice within each SCAI class and
      30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Hemodynamic treatment targets were achieved in most
      patients at the expense of increased vasoactive load and more frequent use of
      epinephrine for each shock severity stage. Mortality was high regardless of
      vasoactive strategy; only in SCAI class C, epinephrine was associated with a
      significantly higher mortality, but the signal was not significant in adjusted
      analysis.

      who received fixation and non-fixation treatments: A population cohort study.
PG  - e0272068
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) in patients
      with lower leg fracture who underwent fixation procedures is not yet completely
      understood. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the risk of subsequent 
      PAOD in patients with lower leg fracture who received fixation and non-fixation
      treatments. METHODS: We included 6538 patients with lower leg fracture who
      received non-fixation treatment and a matched cohort comprising 26152 patients
      who received fixation treatment from the National Health Insurance Database.
      Patients were frequency matched according to age, sex, and index year. The
      incidence and risk of PAOD in patients with lower leg fracture who received
      fixation and non-fixation treatments were evaluated via the stratification of
      different characteristics and comorbidities. RESULTS: Non-fixation treatment,
      male sex, older age (>/= 50 years old), diabetes mellitus, and gout were
      associated with a significantly higher risk of lower extremity PAOD compare to
      each comparison group, respectively. Moreover, there was a significant
      correlation between fixation treatment and a lower risk of lower extremity PAOD
      in women (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] =
      0.38-0.90), women aged > 50 years (aHR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.38-0.96), and patients 
      with coronary artery disease (aHR = 0.43, 95% CI = (0.23-0.81). Further, patients
      with fixation treatment had a significantly lower risk of lower extremity PAOD
      within 2 years after trauma (aHR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.34-0.97). The Kaplan-Meier
      analysis showed that the cumulative incidence of PAOD was significantly higher in
      the non-fixation treatment group than in the fixation treatment group at the end 
      of the 10-year follow-up period (log-rank test: P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Patients 
      with lower leg fracture who received non-fixation treatment had a significantly
      higher risk of PAOD than those who received fixation treatment. Moreover, the
      risk of PAOD was higher in women aged > 50 years, as well as in coronary artery
      disease patients who received non-fixation treatment than in those who received
      fixation treatment. Therefore, regular assessment of vessel patency are
      recommended for these patients. Nevertheless, further studies must be conducted
      to validate the results of our study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In Botswana, cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for 
      females. With limited resources, Botswana is challenged to ensure equitable
      access to advanced cancer care. Botswana's capital city, Gaborone, houses the
      only gynecologic oncology multi-disciplinary team (MDT) and the one
      chemoradiation facility in the country. We aimed to identify areas where fewer
      women were presenting to the MDT clinic for care. METHODS: This cross-sectional
      study examined cervical cancer patients presenting to the MDT clinic between
      January 2015 and March 2020. Patients were geocoded to residential sub-districts 
      to estimate age-standardized presentation rates. Global Moran's I and Anselin
      Local Moran's I tested the null hypothesis that presentation rates occurred
      randomly in Botswana. Community- and individual-level factors of patients living 
      in sub-districts identified with higher (HH) and lower (LL) clusters of
      presentation rates were examined using ordinary least squares with a spatial
      weights matrix and multivariable logistic regression, respectively, with alpha
      level 0.05. RESULTS: We studied 990 patients aged 22-95 (mean: 50.6).
      Presentation rates were found to be geographically clustered across the country
      (p = 0.01). Five sub-districts were identified as clusters, two high (HH)
      sub-district clusters and three low (LL) sub-district clusters (mean presentation
      rate: 35.5 and 11.3, respectively). Presentation rates decreased with increased
      travel distance (p = 0.033). Patients residing in LL sub-districts more often
      reported abnormal vaginal bleeding (aOR: 5.62, 95% CI: 1.31-24.15) compared to
      patients not residing in LL sub-districts. Patients in HH sub-districts were less
      likely to be living with HIV (aOR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.38-0.90) and more likely to
      present with late-stage cancer (aOR: 1.78; 95%CI: 1.20-2.63) compared to patients
      not in HH sub-districts. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified geographic clustering
      of cervical cancer patients presenting for care in Botswana and highlighted
      sub-districts with disproportionately lower presentation rates. Identified
      community- and individual level-factors associated with low presentation rates
      can inform strategies aimed at improving equitable access to cervical cancer
      care.

      indices: A single-blinded crossover study.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272062 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Measures of Doppler blood flow velocity profiles are an integral part 
      of monitoring fetal well-being during pregnancy. These examinations are performed
      at different times of the day and at different maternal meal states. In
      uncomplicated pregnancies, we assessed the effect of a standardized maternal meal
      on middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) Doppler blood flow
      velocity pulsatility indices (PIs) and MCA peak systolic velocity (PSV). METHODS:
      In this prospective single-blinded crossover study 25 healthy women were examined
      at 36 weeks of pregnancy. The first examination was performed in the morning
      following overnight fast, and repeated after extended fast (state A), and after a
      standard breakfast meal (state B). RESULTS: Irrespective of maternal prandial
      status, the MCA-PI values were lower in the 2nd compared to the 1st examination
      (-0.187; p = 0.071, and -0.113; p = 0.099, state A and B, respectively). Compared
      to the values in the 1st examination, the UA-PI values, were higher after
      extended fast (0.014; p = 0.436), and lower post-prandially (-0.036; p = 0.070). 
      The difference (state B minus state A) between the meal states were not
      significant (0.074; p = 0.487 and -0.050; p = 0.058, for MCA-PI and UA-PI,
      respectively). Adjusting for the possible influence of fetal heart rate on MCA-PI
      and UA-PI, the differences between meal states remained non-significant (p =
      0.179, p = 0.064, respectively). The MCA-PSV values increased after the meal
      (6.812; p = 0.035), whereas no increase was observed following extended fast
      (0.140; p = 0.951). The difference in MCA-PSV values between the two meal states 
      was not significant (6.672; p = 0.055). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate
      possible diurnal variations in MCA-PI and UA-PI, with and without adjustment for 
      fetal heart rate, that seem to be unaffected by maternal meal intake in healthy
      pregnancies.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271898 [doi]
AB  - Although observational studies have explored factors that may be associated with 
      osteoporosis, it is not clear whether they are causal. Osteoporosis in men is
      often underestimated. This study aimed to identify the causal risk factors
      associated with bone mineral density(BMD) in men. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) associated with the exposures at the genome-wide significance (p < 5x10-8)
      level were obtained from corresponding genome-wide association studies (GWASs)
      and were utilized as instrumental variables. Summary-level statistical data for
      BMD were obtained from two large-scale UK Biobank GWASs. A Mendelian
      randomization (MR) analysis was performed to identify causal risk factors for
      BMD. Regarding the BMD of the heel bone, the odds of BMD increased per 1-SD
      increase of free testosterone (FT) (OR = 1.13, P = 9.4 x 10-17), together with
      estradiol (E2) (OR = 2.51, P = 2.3 x 10-4). The odds of BMD also increased with
      the lowering of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (OR = 0.87, P = 7.4 x 10-8)
      and total testosterone (TT) (OR = 0.96, P = 3.2 x 10-2) levels. Regarding the BMD
      of the lumbar spine, the odds of BMD increased per 1-SD increase in FT (OR =
      1.18, P = 4.0 x 10-3). Regarding the BMD of the forearm bone, the odds of BMD
      increased with lowering SHBG (OR = 0.75, P = 3.0 x 10-3) and TT (OR = 0.85, P =
      3.0 x 10-3) levels. Our MR study corroborated certain causal relationships and
      provided genetic evidence among sex hormone traits, lifestyle factors and BMD.
      Furthermore, it is a novel insight that TT was defined as a disadvantage for
      osteoporosis in male European populations.

TI  - Causes of infant deaths and patterns of associated factors in Eastern Ethiopia:
      Results of verbal autopsy (InterVA-4) study.
PG  - e0270245
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270245 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a range of setting, detecting and generate empirical information
      on the cause of infant death and contributing risk factors at population level is
      basically utmost essential to take evidence-based measures in reducing infant
      morbidity and mortality. An electronic verbal autopsy is suitable tool and best
      alternative solution to determine individuals' cause of death in a setting where 
      the majority of deaths occur at home and civil registration systems do not exist.
      The present study was undertaken to find out cause of infant death, applying
      computer-based probabilistic model (InterVA-4) and analyze the patterns of
      association factors of mother's and the deceased infant's characteristics to the 
      leading cause-specific infant mortality in Eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: The study
      employed a community-based prospective longitudinal survey, which was conducted
      with routinely enumeration of reported infant deaths for a period of two years
      (from September 2016 to August 2018) in Eastern part of Ethiopia. Using the
      two-stage cluster sampling technique, the study was undertaken in four randomly
      selected districts of West Hararghe zone and two districts of zone 3 in Oromia
      and Afar regional state, respectively. The study included a total of 362 infants 
      who were deceased during the study period. Data was collected by trained
      enumerators by interviewing the mothers or guardians of the deceased infant using
      a 2014 standardize World Health Organization (WHO) Verbal Autopsy questionnaire. 
      InterVA-4 model were used for processing and interpreting verbal autopsy data in 
      order to arrive at the most likely causes of infant death. SPSS version 23 was
      also used for statistical analysis of frequency distribution and logistic
      regression for the association between covariates and outcomes. FINDINGS: Of the 
      overall (362) deceased infants' during the study period, 53.0% of deaths occurred
      during neonatal time while 47.0% died in the post-neonatal period. Acute
      respiratory infection including neonatal and post-neonatal pneumonia (38.4%),
      birth asphyxia (16.4%), diarrheal diseases (16.3%), prematurity (7.4%) and
      malaria (4.3%) were found to be the leading causes of infant mortality in the
      study area. The independent factors strongly associated with probable ARI,
      including pneumonia related mortality as compared to all-causes of death were
      infants with maternal age lower than 20 years old (p = 0.001, AOR: 4.82, 95% CI: 
      1.88, 12.3) and infant being died outside of heath facilities (P = 0.007, AOR:
      2.85, 95% CI: 1.33, 6.12). The post-neonatal period (P = 0.000, AOR: 15.5, 95%
      CI: 6.35, 37.8) and infant died in the wet season (P = 0.006, AOR: 2.38, 95% CI: 
      1.28, 4.44) had strong relationship with dying from diarrhea-related death than
      those infants died from all non-diarrhea. The death due to malaria robustly
      associated with infants whose mothers age between 20-35 years old (P = 0.024,
      AOR: 4.44, 95% CI: 1.22, 16.2) and infant who was dwelled in the districts of
      Afar region (P = 0.013, AOR: 4.08, 95% CI: 1.35, 12.4). CONCLUSION: The highest
      cause of infant mortality was associated with disease of respiratory system,
      particularly acute respiratory infection, including both neonates and
      post-neonatal pneumonia. Most of the infant deaths existed are as a result of
      diseases and conditions that are readily preventable or treatable cause, similar 
      to those reported in worldwide, which have needs of further attention. The
      patterns of significant associated factors across cause-specific mortality
      against all-cause of death were dissimilar. Therefore, strengthen maternal and
      child health program with effective preventive interventions emphasizing on the
      most common cause of infant deaths and those factors contributing in raising
      mortality risk are required.

      placentome growth, and vascular umbilical development in goats.
LID - 10.1111/rda.14224 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether a high-fat diet (HFD) fed to
      goats for a brief period during peri-conception would optimize reproductive and
      fetal responses. Thirty-four Anglo-Nubian crossbred adult goats were allocated
      into three groups: control (n = 11), fed with a total mixed ration (TMR) based on
      chopped elephant grass and concentrate; HFBM (n = 11), given TMR supplemented
      with soybean oil on a 0.5% dry matter basis for 11 days starting nine days before
      mating (BM); and HFAM (n = 12), fed with soybean oil included in the TMR for 15
      days after mating (AM). The TMR diets differed in their fat content (7.5% vs.
      2.9%). All goats had estrus synchronized for 14 days BM by intravaginal
      administration of 60 mg MPA sponge for 12 days. Forty-eight hours BM, the sponge 
      was removed and 0.075 mg PGF2alpha was applied intramuscularly. After 36 hours, 1
      mL GnRH was administered intramuscularly, and goats were mated after sponge
      removal. The fat groups showed lower feed intake (P < 0.001) and higher
      cholesterol levels (P < 0.001) when HFD was administered. Doppler and B-mode
      ultrasound evaluations revealed a greater (P < 0.05) number of small (< 3 mm, 10 
      +/- 0.6 vs 8 +/- 0.5) and large (>/= 3 mm, 6 +/- 0.4 vs 5.0 +/- 0.2) follicles
      and intraovarian blood area (P < 0.05) in the HFBM group during sponge removal
      (57.6%) and mating (24.2%) than those of the no-fat group. During AM, the fat-fed
      groups exhibited higher glutathione peroxidase levels (P < 0.05) and a reduction 
      (P < 0.001) in corpus luteum size (19%) and vascularized Doppler area (41%). No
      difference (P > 0.05) between groups was found in fetal traits, placentome, and
      umbilical vascular development, except for the embryonic vesicle where HFAM twin 
      pregnancy showed a smaller size than the control (26.1 +/- 3.5 cm vs 33.7 +/- 2.7
      cm; P < 0.01). Thus, HFD applied during peri-conception of goats has no impact on
      later fetal development but improved the follicular growth when given before the 
      mating. Thus the use of HFD in periconception has no impact on fetal development 
      but increases follicular growth before breeding time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shift work has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The
      objective of this study was to evaluate the association between sleep
      disturbances and adverse pregnancy outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a
      secondary analysis of a prospective study of participants enrolled in a
      prospective observational study wherein gravidae were screened for sleep apnea
      (2010-2012). A screening questionnaire with standard sleep apnea questionnaires
      as well as novel items about shift work and nocturnal sleep duration was
      administered at a prenatal care visit. Short sleep duration was defined as less
      than 7 hours. Prolonged sleep duration was defined as greater than 9 hours. In a 
      cohort of 1125 pregnant people, 9.4% reported shift work at the time of
      screening. Gravidae who reported shift work were more likely than gravidae who
      reported no shift work to develop preeclampsia (28.3% versus 13.0%, P<0.001),
      preeclamspsia with severe features (16.0% versus 8.5%, P = 0.010), gestational
      diabetes (28.3% versus 19.9%, P = 0.041), and a composite of adverse obstetric
      outcomes (61.3% versus 47.8%, P = 0.008). After adjusting for potentially
      confounding variables, shift work was associated with an increased risk for
      preeclampsia with (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.70, 95% CI 1.03-2.79, p =
      0.036) and without (aRR 2.03, 95% CI 1.43-2.90, p<0.001) severe features, and
      gestational diabetes mellitus class A1 (aRR 1.47, 95% CI 1.05-2.05, p = 0.023)
      and class A2 (aRR 1.67, 95% CI 1.13-2.44, p = 0.009). Sleep duration was
      associated with gestational diabetes (31.3% among those with short sleep
      duration, 25.2% among those with normal sleep duration and 14.0% among those with
      prolonged sleep duration, P<0.001) and gestational diabetes class A2 (29.5%,
      17.9%, and 10.1%, respectively, P<0.001). Gravidae with prolonged sleep duration 
      experienced less composite adverse pregnancy outcomes at 42.6% compared to 57.4% 
      for those with short sleep duration or 52.5% for those with normal sleep
      duration, P = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS: Shift work and sleep duration are both
      associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Further research on the impact of
      sleep disturbance on pregnancy outcomes is warranted.

PG  - e0272496
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272496 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impostor syndrome is characterized by fraudulent self-doubt and
      correlates with burnout, and adverse mental health. OBJECTIVE: The objective was 
      to investigate correlates of Impostor syndrome in a medical education cohort and 
      determine if an interactive workshop can improve knowledge and perception of
      Impostor syndrome. METHODS: From June 2019 to February 2021 interactive
      educational workshops were conducted for medical education cohorts. Participants 
      completed baseline knowledge and Impostor syndrome self-identification surveys,
      participated in interactive presentations and discussions, followed by
      post-intervention surveys. RESULTS: There were 198 participants including 19%
      residents, 10% medical students, 30% faculty and 41% Graduate Medical Education
      (GME) administrators. Overall, 57% were positive for Impostor syndrome.
      Participants classified as the following Impostor syndrome competence subtypes:
      Expert = 42%; Soloist = 34%; Super-person = 31%; Perfectionist = 25%; and Natural
      Genius = 21%. Self-identified contributors of IS included: parent expectations = 
      72%, female gender = 58%, and academic rat race = 37%. GME administrators
      compared to physicians/medical students had significantly higher number of
      self-identified contributors to Impostor syndrome. Knowledge survey scores
      increased from 4.94 (SD = 2.8) to 5.78 (2.48) post intervention (p = 0.045).
      Participants with Impostor syndrome competence subtypes had increased perceptions
      of Impostor syndrome as a cause of stress, failure to reach full potential, and
      negative relationships/teamwork (p = 0.032 -<0.001). CONCLUSION: Impostor
      syndrome was common in this medical education cohort, and those with Impostor
      syndrome significantly attributed negative personal and professional outcomes to 
      Impostor syndrome. An interactive workshop on Impostor syndrome can be used to
      increase perceptions and knowledge regarding Impostor syndrome. The materials can
      be adapted for relevance to various audiences.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is alarmingly a global health catastrophe that has created 
      an unprecedented mental health decline especially in young adults, who have been 
      noted to be a vulnerable population. In this study, we investigated the
      prevalence of depression and anxiety in university students in China and Africa
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, the significant factors contributing to the
      prevalence of anxiety and depression, the differences in factors affecting the
      different groups being investigated and to emphasize that psychological
      intervention are as important as the physical interventions during and after the 
      pandemic. The study was conducted through online surveys, with 684 participants
      using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7
      standardized scales. Comparing all groups combined, of the 636 participants, 361 
      (56.8%) had depression and 227 (35.7%) had anxiety. Chi squared tests at
      significance level (P<0.05) showed that country of citizenship, religion,
      parents' educational background, household monthly income and, having family
      members with COVID-19 variables were strongly associated with depression and
      anxiety. In contrast, age, gender, educational background, and major showed no
      significant association. Comparing the individual groups separately using chi
      square (P<0.05), the Chinese students in China group had 35.6% with depression
      and 13.1% with anxiety. The variable associated with both depression and anxiety 
      was education major, with depression only was parent's educational background and
      with anxiety only was gender. The African students in China group had 70.3% with 
      depression and 45.0% with anxiety. Gender was strongly associated with both
      depression and anxiety, and religion and having family members with COVID-19 with
      anxiety only. Africans in Africa had 66.0% with depression and 50.5% with
      anxiety. Educational background was strongly associated with depression. There
      was no statistically significant variable for anxiety. Chi square test showed a
      statistically significant difference in depression and anxiety levels with the
      Chinese group compared to both African groups, and no significant difference
      between both African groups. Our findings demonstrated that COVID-19 had a
      negative psychological impact on university students. Therefore, more attention
      should be put on youth's mental health during this pandemic.

      symptoms from COVID-19: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - e0269065
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269065 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether anakinra, an interleukin-1receptor
      inhibitor, could improve outcome in moderate COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this 
      controlled, open-label trial, we enrolled adults with COVID-19 requiring oxygen. 
      We randomly assigned patients to receive intravenous anakinra plus optimized
      standard of care (oSOC) vs. oSOC alone. The primary outcome was treatment success
      at day 14 defined as patient alive and not requiring mechanical ventilation or
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: Between 27th April and 6th October 
      2020, we enrolled 71 patients (240 patients planned to been enrolled): 37 were
      assigned to the anakinra group and 34 to oSOC group. The study ended prematurely 
      by recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board due to safety concerns.
      On day 14, the proportion of treatment success was significantly lower in the
      anakinra group 70% (n = 26) vs. 91% (n = 31) in the oSOC group: risk
      difference-21 percentage points (95% CI, -39 to -2), odds ratio 0.23 (95% CI,
      0.06 to 0.91), p = 0.027. After a 28-day follow-up, 9 patients in the anakinra
      group and 3 in the oSOC group had died. Overall survival at day 28 was 75% (95%
      CI, 62% to 91%) in the anakinra group versus 91% (95% CI, 82% to 100%) (p = 0.06)
      in the oSOC group. Serious adverse events occurred in 19 (51%) patients in the
      anakinra group and 18 (53%) in the oSOC group (p = 0.89). CONCLUSION: This trial 
      did not show efficacy of anakinra in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore,
      contrary to our hypothesis, we found that anakinra was inferior to oSOC in
      patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 can cause some individuals to experience chronic symptoms.
      Rates and predictors of chronic COVID-19 symptoms are not fully elucidated.
      OBJECTIVE: To examine occurrence and patterns of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV2
      infection (PASC) symptomatology and their relationship with demographics, acute
      COVID-19 symptoms and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses. METHODS: A
      multi-stage observational study was performed of adults (>/=18 years) from 5 US
      states. Participants completed two rounds of electronic surveys (May-July 2020;
      April-May 2021) and underwent testing to anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein IgG
      antibody testing. Latent Class Analysis was used to identify clusters of chronic 
      COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: Overall, 390 adults (median [25%ile, 75%ile] age: 42 
      [31, 54] years) with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies completed the follow-up
      survey; 92 (24.7%) had >/=1 chronic COVID-19 symptom, with 11-month median
      duration of persistent symptoms (range: 1-12 months). The most common chronic
      COVID-19 symptoms were fatigue (11.3%), change in smell (9.5%) or taste (5.6%),
      muscle or joint aches (5.4%) and weakness (4.6%). There were significantly higher
      proportions of >/=1 persistent COVID-19 symptom (31.5% vs. 18.6%; Chi-square, P =
      0.004), and particularly fatigue (15.8% vs. 7.3%, P = 0.008) and headaches (5.4% 
      vs. 1.0%, P = 0.011) in females compared to males. Chronic COVID-19 symptoms were
      also increased in individuals with >/=6 acute COVID-19 symptoms, Latent class
      analysis revealed 4 classes of symptoms. Latent class-1 (change of smell and
      taste) was associated with lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels; class-2 and 3
      (multiple chronic symptoms) were associated with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody 
      levels and more severe acute COVID-19 infection. LIMITATIONS: Ambulatory cohort
      with less severe acute disease. CONCLUSION: Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection
      commonly experience chronic symptoms, most commonly fatigue, changes in smell or 
      taste and muscle/joint aches. Female sex, severity of acute COVID-19 infection,
      and higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were associated with the highest risk of
      having chronic COVID-19 symptoms.

TI  - A genome-wide association study for rheumatoid arthritis replicates previous HLA 
      and non-HLA associations in a cohort from South Africa.

AB  - The complex pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not fully understood,
      with few studies exploring the genomic contribution to RA in patients from
      Africa. We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of South-Eastern
      Bantu-Speaking South Africans (SEBSSAs) with seropositive RA (n = 531) and
      population controls (n = 2653). Association testing was performed using PLINK
      (logistic regression assuming an additive model) with sex, age, smoking and the
      first three principal components as covariates. The strong association with the
      HLA region, indexed by rs602457 (near HLA-DRB1), was replicated. An additional
      independent signal in the HLA region represented by the lead SNP rs2523593 (near 
      the HLA-B gene; Conditional P-value = 6.4x10-10) was detected. Although none of
      the non-HLA signals reached genome-wide significance (P < 5x10-8), 17 genomic
      regions showed suggestive association (P < 5x10-6). The GWAS replicated two known
      non-HLA associations with MMEL1 (rs2843401) and ANKRD55 (rs7731626) at a
      threshold of P < 5x10-3 providing, for the first time, evidence for replication
      of non-HLA signals for RA in sub-Saharan African populations. Meta-analysis with 
      summary statistics from an African-American cohort (CLEAR study) replicated three
      additional non-HLA signals (rs11571302, rs2558210 and rs2422345 around
      KRT18P39-NPM1P33, CTLA4-ICOS and AL645568.1, respectively). Analysis based on
      genomic regions (200Kb windows) further replicated previously reported non-HLA
      signals around PADI4, CD28 and LIMK1. Although allele frequencies were overall
      strongly correlated between the SEBSSA and the CLEAR cohort, we observed some
      differences in effect size estimates for associated loci. The study highlights
      the need for conducting larger association studies across diverse African
      populations to inform precision medicine-based approaches for RA in Africa.

TI  - Cognitive decline detection for Alzheimer's disease patients through an activity

LID - 10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3196435 [doi]
AB  - There are conventional screening instruments for the detection of cognitive
      impairment, but they have a reduced ecological validity and the information they 
      present could be biased. This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness and
      usefulness of a task based on an activity of daily living (ADL) for the detection
      of cognitive impairment for an Alzheimer's disease (AD) population. Twenty-four
      participants were included in the study. The AD group (ADG) included twelve older
      adults (12 female) with AD (81.75+/-7.8 years). The Healthy group (HG) included
      twelve older adults (5 males, 77.7 +/- 6.4 years). Both groups received a
      ADL-based intervention at two time frames separated 3 weeks. Cognitive functions 
      were assessed before the interventions by using the MEC-35. The test-retest
      method was used to evaluate the reliability of the task, as well as the
      Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). The analysis of the test-retest
      reliability of the scores in the task indicated an excellent clinical relevance
      for both groups. The hypothesis of equality of the means of the scores in the two
      applications of the task was accepted for both the ADG and HG, respectively. The 
      task also showed a significant high degree of association with the MEC-35 test
      (rho = 0.710, p = 0.010) for the ADG. Our results showed that it is possible to
      use an ADL-based task to assess everyday memory intended for cognitive
      impairments detection. In the same way, the task could be used to promote
      cognitive function and prevent dementia.

TI  - Safety of Antifibrinolytics in 6583 Pediatric Patients Having Craniosynostosis
      Surgery: A Decade of Data Reported from the Multicenter Pediatric Craniofacial
      Collaborative Group.
LID - 10.1111/pan.14540 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid (TXA) and
      epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) are effective at reducing blood loss and
      transfusion in pediatric patients having craniofacial surgery. The Pediatric
      Craniofacial Collaborative Group (PCCG) has previously reported low rates of
      seizures and thromboembolic events (equal to no antifibrinolytic given) in open
      craniofacial surgery. AIMS: To query the PCCG database to provide an updated
      antifibrinolytic safety profile in children given that antifibrinolytics have
      become recommended standard of care in this surgical population. Additionally, we
      include the population of younger infants having minimally invasive procedures.
      METHODS: Patients in the PCCG registry between June 2012 and March 2021 having
      open craniofacial surgery (fronto-orbital advancement, mid and posterior vault,
      total cranial vault remodeling, intracranial LeFort III monobloc), endoscopic
      cranial suture release, and spring mediated cranioplasty were included. The
      primary outcome is the rate of postoperative complications possibly attributable 
      to antifibrinolytic use (seizures, seizure-like activity, and thromboembolic
      events) in infants and children undergoing craniosynostosis surgery who did or
      did not receive antifibrinolytics. RESULTS: Forty-five institutions reporting
      6583 patients were included. The overall seizure rate was 0.24% (95% CI: 0.14,
      0.39%), with 0.20% in the No Antifibrinolytic group and 0.26% in the combined
      Antifibrinolytic group, with no statistically reported difference. Comparing
      seizure rates between TXA (0.22%) and EACA (0.44%), there was no statistically
      significant difference (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI: 0.6, 6.7; P=0.257). Seizure
      rate was higher in patients greater than 6 months (0.30% vs 0.18%; P=0.327),
      patients undergoing open procedures (0.30% vs 0.06%; P=0.141), and syndromic
      patients (0.70% vs 0.19%; P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter international
      experience of pediatric craniofacial surgery reports no increase in seizures or
      thromboembolic events in those that received antifibrinolytics (TXA and EACA)
      versus those that did not. This report provides further evidence of
      antifibrinolytic safety. We recommend following pharmacokinetic-based dosing
      guidelines for administration.

TI  - Lifting the midface using a hyaluronic acid filler with lidocaine: a randomized
      multi-center study in a Chinese population.
LID - 10.1111/jocd.15286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soft-tissue augmentation of the midface is increasingly requested by 
      patients, and hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are frequently used in treatment.
      AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment of midface volume/contour 
      deficit with a firm HA filler including lidocaine (HARL ). PATIENTS/METHODS: This
      was a 12-month, randomized, evaluator-blinded, controlled study. Chinese adults
      with mild to substantial volume loss were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to
      treatment or untreated control groups. RESULTS: A total of 148 subjects were
      enrolled. The primary objective was met; results of the midface volume scale
      (MMVS) rated by a blinded evaluator were in favor of HARL at Month 6 (p< 0.0001
      vs. the untreated control group). Similar to the MMVS improvement, improved
      midface fullness and aesthetic appearance was observed based on the Global
      Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) up to 12 months by both treating investigators
      and subjects (at least 96% at Week 4 and 65% at Month 12). Subject satisfaction
      was high, and the majority of subjects considered the results to look natural
      (>97%). The study product was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Midfacial treatment
      using HARL was effective, well tolerated, and led to high levels of satisfaction 
      in a Chinese population for up to 12 months.

TI  - Short- and Long-Term Risk of Lead Dislodgement Events: Real-World Experience From
      Product Surveillance Registry.
PG  - 101161CIRCEP122011029
LID - 10.1161/CIRCEP.122.011029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lead dislodgement (LD) has been one of the most common early
      complications after cardiovascular implantable electronic device implant.
      However, limited data are available on the clinical characteristics and long-term
      outcomes of LD events. The aim of this study was to examine the risk factors,
      clinical significance, and management strategies of LD events after
      cardiovascular implantable electronic device implant. METHODS: This study was a
      retrospective cohort analysis of 20 683 patients who underwent cardiovascular
      implantable electronic device implant between January 1, 2010 and January 31,
      2020 in Medtronic's Product Surveillance Registry, with a mean follow-up time of 
      3.3+/-2.5 SD years. The study population was divided into 2 groups: group A with 
      LD events (N=350) and group B without LD events (N=20 333). RESULTS: During this 
      period, 350 patients (1.69%) had LD events involving 371 leads (0.95%), among a
      total of 39 060 leads implanted. Passive fixation type (right atrium pacing lead,
      P=0.041), lower sensing amplitude (right ventricle defibrillating lead, P=0.020),
      and lower lead impedance at implant (right atrium pacing lead, P=0.009) were
      associated with increased LD risk. Multivariate analysis showed female sex
      (hazard ratio, 1.520, P=0.008) and higher body mass index (hazard ratio, 1.012,
      P=0.001) were independently associated with increased risk of LD events. LD
      events were not associated with significant changes in the long-term risks of
      cardiac and overall mortality. In group A, repositioning the dislodged leads
      increased the risk of a second LD event compared with implanting new leads
      (P=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Female sex and higher body mass index were associated
      with higher risk of LD events in the Product Surveillance Registry. Among
      patients with dislodged leads, implanting new leads was associated with lower
      risk of future LD events. Further studies on how to reduce LD risk and to improve
      management of these events are needed. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.

TI  - The Effect of Pulse Shape and Interphase Gaps on Speech Perception and Perceived 
      Sound Quality in Electrical Hearing.
LID - 10.1097/AUD.0000000000001262 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stimulation with triphasic pulses has been shown to reduce the
      occurrence of unwanted facial nerve stimulation (FNS) with cochlear implants
      (CIs). However, there is little data available on how different pulse shapes
      affect the hearing outcome with electrical hearing in general. The aim of the
      study was to evaluate the effects of different stimulation pulse shapes on speech
      perception in noise, as well as loudness perception and subjective sound quality.
      METHODS: Twenty experienced cochlear-implant users not suffering from FNS
      participated in a prospective single-visit study. Based on the subjects' current 
      clinical fitting, six fitting maps with different pulse shapes (biphasic and
      triphasic) and different interphase gap (IPG) durations (2.1 micros, 10 micros,
      and 20 micros) were created. First, the loudness was balanced for each
      configuration by adjusting the stimulation charge amount. Then, speech perception
      in noise was measured with a German matrix sentence test (Oldenburg Sentence
      test). The perception of particular sound attributes of speech and music, as well
      as overall preference, was evaluated with visual analog scales. RESULTS: Similar 
      levels of speech perception were obtained with triphasic stimulation (P = 0.891) 
      and longer IPGs (P = 0.361) compared to the subjects' clinical map settings. The 
      stimulation amplitudes for equal loudness were significantly higher with
      triphasic stimulation compared to biphasic stimulation when keeping the IPG
      constant. Increasing the IPG had a significantly larger effect on perceived
      loudness (P < 0.0001) and charge reduction for equal loudness with triphasic
      pulses compared to biphasic pulses. Triphasic configuration showed lower overall 
      subjective sound quality ratings than biphasic for speech intelligibility,
      clarity, naturalness, and overall preference, as well as for music naturalness,
      and overall preference in the acute setting without adaptation time. Post-hoc
      pairwise comparisons against the clinical map revealed significantly lower speech
      naturalness ratings for triphasic with 2.1 micros IPG and for triphasic with 20
      micros IPG only. CONCLUSION: Although some sound quality attributes were rated
      lower compared to the clinical map in the acute test setting, stimulation with
      triphasic pulses does not affect speech perception in noise and can be considered
      as a valuable option in CI fitting.

TI  - Chromosomal-level assembly of Bactericera cockerelli reveals rampant gene family 
      expansions impacting genome structure, function and
      insect-microbe-plant-interactions.
LID - 10.1111/1755-0998.13693 [doi]
AB  - Lineage specific expansions and gene duplications are some of the most important 
      sources of evolutionary novelty in eukaryotes. Although not as prevalent in
      eukaryotes compared to bacteria, horizontal gene transfer events can also result 
      in key adaptations for insects, especially for those involved in insect-microbe
      interactions. In this study we assemble the first chromosomal assembly of the
      psyllid Bactericera cockerelli and reveal that the B. cockerelli genome has
      experienced significantly more gene expansion events compared to other Hemipteran
      representatives with fully sequenced genomes. We also reveal that B. cockerelli's
      genome is the largest psyllid genome (567 Mb) sequenced to date and is ~15%
      larger than the other two psyllid species genomes sequenced (Pachypsylla venusta 
      and Diaphorina citri). Structurally, B. cockerelli appears to have an additional 
      chromosome compared to the distantly related psyllid species P. venusta due to a 
      previous chromosomal fission or fusion event. The increase in genome size and
      dynamic nature of the B. cockerelli genome may largely be contributed to the
      widespread expansion of type I and type II repeat elements that are rampant
      across all of B. cockerelli's. chromosomes. These repeat elements are distributed
      near equally in both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions. Furthermore,
      significant gene family expansions and gene duplications were uncovered for genes
      that are expected to be important in its adaptation to insect-plant and microbe
      interactions, which include transcription factors, proteases, odorant receptors, 
      and horizontally transferred genes that are involved in the nutritional symbioses
      with their long-term nutritional endosymbiont Carsonella.

TI  - Narrow-band reflectance spectrophotometry and infrared thermography for
      assessment of skin lesions in localized scleroderma.
LID - 10.1111/jdv.18483 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infrared thermography (IRT) is a useful method to detect
      activity/inflammation in localized scleroderma (LoS), however inactive skin
      lesions with a severe degree of dermal and subcutaneous atrophy may show false
      positive results. Narrow-band reflectance spectrophotometry (NBRS) is an
      objective, noninvasive technique of measuring erythema and hyperpigmentation
      severity, yet has not been extensively studied in LoS. OBJECTIVES: The aim of
      this research was to compare the spectrophotometric results with thermographic
      examination of LoS lesions. METHODS: The lesions were assessed using the
      Localized Scleroderma Assessment Tool (LoSCAT), Dyspigmentation, Induration,
      Erythema, and Telangiectasias (DIET) score, NBRS and IRT. The difference of the
      erythema index (DeltaEI), melanin index (DeltaMI) and average temperature Tavg
      (DeltaTavg) were calculated between each lesion and its normal control. RESULTS: 
      Fifty-five patients with 49 active and 64 inactive LoS lesions were examined. The
      DeltaEI strongly correlated with the erythema (rs =0.62, p <0.0000002) and DIET
      score (rs = 0.66, p <0.0000001) and moderately correlated with the
      telangiectasias score (rs =0.58, p <0.00001). DeltaMI showed strong correlation
      with the dyspigmentation score (rs =0.65, p <0.0000001). There was a strong
      correlation between the DeltaTavg and the erythema score (rs =0.7, p <0.000001). 
      A moderate correlation between the Delta EI and DeltaTavg was found in active LoS
      lesions (rs =0.53 p <0.0001). CONCLUSION: NBRS may be a complementary method for 
      determining erythema in LoS active lesions, although this technique remains
      inferior to IRT, because is unable to distinct between active and inactive
      lesions. However, NBRS enables to evaluate the severity of hyperpigmentation and 
      telangiectasias, and it can be useful for the assessment of disease severity
      which is poorly evaluated by IRT.

TI  - Outbreaks of Acute Gastrointestinal Illness Associated with a Splash Pad in a
      Wildlife Park - Kansas, June 2021.
PG  - 981-987
LID - 10.15585/mmwr.mm7131a1 [doi]
AB  - In June 2021, Kansas state and county public health officials identified and
      investigated three cases of shigellosis (a bacterial diarrheal illness caused by 
      Shigella spp.) associated with visiting a wildlife park. The park has animal
      exhibits and a splash pad. Two affected persons visited animal exhibits, and all 
      three entered the splash pad. Nonhuman primates are the only known animal
      reservoir of Shigella. The splash pad, which sprays water on users and is
      designed so that water does not collect in the user area, was closed on June 19. 
      The state and county public health codes do not include regulations for splash
      pads. Thus, these venues are not typically inspected, and environmental health
      expertise is limited. A case-control study identified two distinct outbreaks
      associated with the park (a shigellosis outbreak involving 21 cases and a
      subsequent norovirus infection outbreak involving six cases). Shigella and
      norovirus can be transmitted by contaminated water; in both outbreaks, illness
      was associated with getting splash pad water in the mouth (multiply imputed
      adjusted odds ratio [aORMI] = 6.4, p = 0.036; and 28.6, p = 0.006, respectively).
      Maintaining adequate water disinfection and environmental health expertise and
      targeting prevention efforts to caregivers of splash pad users help prevent
      splash pad-associated outbreaks. Outbreak incidence might be further reduced when
      U.S. jurisdicitons voluntarily adopt CDC's Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC)
      recommendations and through the prevention messages: "Don't get in the water if
      sick with diarrhea," "Don't stand or sit above the jets," and "Don't swallow the 
      water."(dagger).

TI  - Achieving a Highly Stable Electrode/Electrolyte Interface for a Nickel-Rich
      Cathode via an Additive-Containing Gel Polymer Electrolyte.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c09103 [doi]
AB  - The nickel-rich cathode LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) is deemed as a prospective
      material for high-voltage lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its merits of
      high discharge capacity and low cobalt content. However, the unsatisfactory
      cyclic stability and thermostability that originate from the unstable
      electrode/electrolyte interface restrict its commercial application. Herein, a
      novel electrolyte composed of a polyethylene (PE) supported poly(vinylidene
      fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VdF-HFP)) based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE)
      strengthened by a film-forming additive of 3-(trimethylsilyl)phenylboronic acid
      (TMSPB) is proposed. The porous structure and good oxidative stability of the
      P(VdF-HFP)/PE membrane help to expand the oxidative potential of GPE to 5.5 V
      compared with 5.1 V for the liquid electrolyte. The developed GPE also has better
      thermal stability, contributing to improving the safety performance of LIBs.
      Furthermore, the TMSPB additive constructs a low-impedance and stable cathode
      electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the NCM811 cathode surface, compensating for
      GPE's drawbacks of sluggish kinetics. Consequently, the NCM811 cathode matched
      with 3% TMSPB-containing GPE exhibits remarkable cyclicity and rate capability,
      maintaining 94% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles at a high voltage range 
      of 3.0-4.35 V and delivering a capacity of 133.5 mAh g(-1) under 15 C high
      current rate compared with 68% and 75.8 mAh g(-1) for the one with an
      additive-free liquid electrolyte. By virtue of the enhanced stability of the
      NCM811cathode, the cyclability of graphite||NCM811 full cell also increases from 
      48 to 81% after 100 cycles. The incorporation of P(VdF-HFP)-based GPE and TMSPB
      electrolyte additive points out a viable and convenient pathway to unlock the
      properties of high energy density and satisfactory safety for next-generation
      LIBs.

TI  - Multicenter Study to Evaluate Endovascular Repair of Extent I-III
      Thoracoabdominal Aneurysms Without Prophylactic Cerebrospinal Fluid Drainage.
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005653 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes of fenestrated-branched endovascular aortic repair 
      (FB-EVAR) of Extent I-III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) without
      prophylactic cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CSFD). BACKGROUND: Prophylactic CSFD
      has been routinely used during endovascular TAAA repair, but concerns about major
      drain-related complications gave led to revising this paradigm. METHODS: We
      reviewed a multicenter cohort of 541 patients treated for Extent I-III TAAAs by
      FB-EVAR without prophylactic CSFD. Spinal cord injury (SCI) was graded as
      ambulatory (paraparesis) or non-ambulatory (paraplegia). Endpoints were any SCI, 
      permanent paraplegia, response to rescue treatment, major drain-related
      complications, mortality, and patient survival. RESULTS: There were 22 Extent I, 
      240 Extent II and 279 Extent III TAAAs. Thirty-day mortality was 3%. SCI occurred
      in 45 patients (8%), paraparesis occurring in 23 (4%) and paraplegia in 22
      patients (4%). SCI was more common in patients with Extent I-II compared to
      Extent III TAAAs (12% vs. 5%, P=0.01). Rescue treatment included permissive
      hypertension in all patients, with CSFD in 22 (4%). Symptom improvement was noted
      in 73%. Twelve patients (2%) had permanent paraplegia. Two patients (0.4%) had
      major drain-related complications. Independent predictors for SCI by multivariate
      logistic regression were sustained peri-operative hypotension (OR 4.4, 95% CI
      1.7-11.1), patent collateral network (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.6), and total length
      of aortic coverage (OR 1.05, CI 95% 1.01-1.10). Patient survival at 3-years was
      72+/-3%. CONCLUSION: FB-EVAR of Extent I-III TAAAs without CSFD has low mortality
      and low rates of permanent paraplegia (2%). SCI occurred in 8% of patients, and
      rescue treatment improved symptoms in 73% of them.

TI  - The Diagnostic Efficacy of an App-based Diagnostic Health Care Application in the
      Emergency Room: eRadaR-Trial. A prospective, Double-blinded, Observational Study.
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005614 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the app-based diagnostic tool
      Ada and the impact on patient outcome in the emergency room (ER). BACKGROUND:
      Artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic tools can improve targeted
      processes in healthcare delivery by integrating patient information with a
      medical knowledge base and a machine learning system, providing clinicians with
      differential diagnoses and recommendations. METHODS: Patients presenting to the
      ER with abdominal pain self-assessed their symptoms using the Ada-App under
      supervision and were subsequently assessed by the ER physician. Diagnostic
      accuracy was evaluated by comparing the App-diagnoses with the final discharge
      diagnoses. Timing of diagnosis and time to treatment were correlated with
      complications, overall survival, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: In this
      prospective, double-blinded study, 450 patients were enrolled and followed up
      until day 90. Ada suggested the final discharge diagnosis in 52.0% (95% CI [0.47,
      0.57]) of patients compared to the classical doctor-patient interaction, which
      was significantly superior with 80.9% (95% CI [0.77, 0.84], P<0.001). However,
      when diagnostic accuracy of both were assessed together, Ada significantly
      increased the accuracy rate (87.3%, P<0.001), when compared to the ER physician
      alone. Patients with an early time point of diagnosis and rapid treatment
      allocation exhibited significantly reduced complications (P<0.001) and length of 
      hospital stay (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Currently, the classical patient-physician
      interaction is superior to an AI-based diagnostic tool applied by patients.
      However, AI tools have the potential to additionally benefit the diagnostic
      efficacy of clinicians and improve quality of care.

TI  - Effect of 5:2 Fasting Diet on Liver Fat Content in Patients with Type 2 Diabetic 
      with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.
LID - 10.1089/met.2022.0014 [doi]
AB  - Background: The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly
      growing in China, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Weight loss strategies have been shown to treat NAFLD effectively. We conducted a
      24-week, prospective, randomized study in T2DM patients with NAFLD to evaluate
      the effects of a 5:2 fasting diet on liver fat content. Methods: Sixty-one T2DM
      patients with NAFLD were enrolled and randomly divided into a 5:2 fasting diet
      intervention group (5:2 diet group, n = 31) and 1.8 mg/day liraglutide
      intervention group (Lira group, n = 30). The study was performed for 24 weeks.
      Data of the body weight, waist circumference, plasma lipids and glucose profile, 
      fasting plasma insulin, and liver function parameters were collected. Controlled 
      attenuation parameter (CAP) was measured to assess the liver fat content.
      Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured to evaluate
      oxidative stress status. Results: At 24 weeks after intervention, compared with
      those at baseline, CAP was significantly decreased in both the 5:2 diet group and
      Lira group, which was 7.4% and 5.5%, respectively. Body weight, plasma lipids and
      glucose profile, and liver function parameters improved significantly, while
      homeostasis model assessment-beta (HOMA-beta) was significantly increased in both
      groups (all P < 0.05). Stepwise linear regression showed that increased HOMA-beta
      and SOD, as well as reduced body mass index (BMI), were the independent
      predictors of CAP decrease in the Lira group (P = 0.000, 0.000, 0.015). In
      contrast, reduced BMI and MDA were the independent influencing factors of CAP
      decrease in the 5:2 diet group (P = 0.011, 0.043). The common side effects in the
      5:2 diet group were hunger (60%), weakness (10%), and constipation (0.3%).
      Conclusions: A 5:2 fasting diet achieved comparable effects with liraglutide on
      liver fat content in patients with T2DM with NAFLD by reducing BMI and oxidative 
      stress. Both treatment strategies were safe and effective for glucose control.

TI  - The impact of borderline personality disorder symptoms on onset and course of
      anxiety disorders: Results of a general population study.
LID - 10.1037/per0000598 [doi]
AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has a negative impact on the onset and
      course of anxiety disorders. However, even though many people with anxiety
      disorders only have some BPD symptoms, little is known about the impact of BPD
      symptoms on anxiety disorders. This study examines the impact of BPD symptoms on 
      the onset and persistence of anxiety disorders over a 3-year follow-up in the
      general population. Longitudinal data from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey
      and Incidence study were used (N = 4,618). BPD symptoms were assessed using the
      International Personality Examination, and anxiety disorders and other mental
      disorders were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
      Logistic regression analyses were performed, adjusting for a wide range of
      potential confounders such as childhood abuse and mood disorders. In all, 72.1%
      of the participants reported no BPD symptoms, 24.0% reported one to two symptoms,
      3.1% reported three to four symptoms, and 0.8% reported >/= 5 symptoms. There was
      a clear dose-response relation, with more BPD symptoms being associated with a
      higher risk for onset and persistence of anxiety disorders (both p for trend <
      .001). Even one to two BPD symptoms significantly impacted the onset (odds ratio 
      = 3.32, 95% confidence interval [1.68, 6.54]) and persistence (odds ratio = 3.12,
      95% confidence interval [1.01, 9.64]). Results appeared to be independent of
      multiple potential confounders. Even a low number of BPD symptoms impact the
      onset and persistence of anxiety disorders. Targeting these symptoms may improve 
      the outcome of anxiety disorders. Future research should study the effect of
      various interventions for people with anxiety disorders and BPD symptoms.

TI  - Childhood trauma, stressful life events, and depression: Exploring the mediating 
      effect of cognitive flexibility.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001337 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Childhood trauma and stressful life events have been identified as
      risk factors for the development of depression. However, little is known about
      the potential cognitive mechanisms underlying these associations. This study aims
      to investigate the associations among childhood trauma, stressful life events,
      and depression and to test a mediating model to examine the roles of cognitive
      flexibility in these associations. METHOD: First-year university students (n =
      2627; Mage = 18.29, SDage = .86) were recruited from a medical university in
      Guangzhou, China. A total of 1,600 (60.9%) females and 1,027 (39.1%) males
      participated in the survey. Participants were administered self-report measures
      assessing childhood trauma, stressful life events, cognitive flexibility, and
      depression. RESULTS: Childhood trauma and stressful life events were both
      negative predictors of cognitive flexibility (beta = -.32, beta = -.19,
      respectively; ps < .01), which in turn was a negative predictor of depression
      (beta = -.50, p < .01). Cognitive flexibility partially mediated the relationship
      between childhood trauma and depression (with the indirect effect = .161, 95%
      confidence interval, CI [.139, .185]) as well as the relationship between
      stressful life events and depression (with the indirect effect = .097, 95% CI
      [.078, .118]). CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that childhood trauma and
      stressful life events not only have a direct effect on depression but also
      increase individuals' risk of depression by decreasing their cognitive
      flexibility. These findings shed light on the possible potential mechanism
      underlying the suicide process and highlight the important role of cognitive
      flexibility in suicide prevention and intervention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)

TI  - Short-term psychological outcomes of Australia's 2019/20 bushfire season.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001323 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated how Australian community members (N = 318) indirectly 
      and/or directly exposed to Australia's 2019/20 bushfire season differed in terms 
      of psychological distress, posttraumatic growth, coping, physical health, and
      COVID-19 anxiety. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study with a nonequivalent
      groups design. Participants were over 18 years old, English proficient, and
      Australian permanent residents or citizens living in Australia at some point
      between June 2019 and February 2020. Participants completed a 10-minute anonymous
      online survey 5 to 8 weeks following the bushfires. RESULTS: A descriptive
      discriminant analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between
      bushfire exposure groups when considering our dependent variables of interest
      simultaneously and adjusting for prior mental health assistance and prior
      exposure to natural disasters: F(10, 624) = 2.83, p = .002; V = .087, partial
      eta(2) = .043. The group centroid for the indirect-only exposure group (-.374)
      was substantially lower than that for the other 2 groups (direct only: .137;
      direct + indirect: .224), indicating that the indirect-only exposure group could 
      be differentiated by the fact that they more frequently reported avoidant coping 
      strategies and endorsed lower posttraumatic growth scores than the direct-only
      and direct + indirect exposure groups. The variance accounted for by these
      discriminant variables was 8.4%, indicating a very small effect. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results point to a need to tailor and/or expand disaster preparedness, response, 
      and recovery efforts such that they might benefit community members both directly
      and indirectly exposed to bushfire events in Australia. (PsycInfo Database Record

TI  - Not how often but when: Self-efficacy to control cannabis use and PTSS.
LID - 10.1037/tra0001347 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cannabis use is prevalent with trauma survivors. Yet, the effects of
      cannabis use on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have been equivocal with
      some studies showing a positive association and some showing a negative
      association. Integrating the self-medication hypothesis and social cognitive
      theory (SCT), the present study aimed to elucidate differential outcomes by
      considering frequency of cannabis use and self-efficacy to control cannabis use
      in different contexts (i.e., social facilitation, opportunistic, and emotional
      relief) in relation to PTSS. METHOD: Undergraduate students (N = 314) who
      endorsed lifetime trauma exposure and past-month cannabis use completed
      self-report measures assessing cannabis use behaviors, self-efficacy to control
      use, and PTSS. RESULTS: Parallel mediation revealed that initially, greater
      frequency of cannabis use was associated with PTSS severity (beta = .16, SE =
      .09, p = .004). With the inclusion of emotional relief self-efficacy,
      opportunistic self-efficacy, and social facilitation self-efficacy to control
      cannabis use as parallel mediators, frequency of cannabis use no longer predicted
      PTSS severity. There was also a significant indirect effect of emotional relief
      self-efficacy to control cannabis use on frequency of use and PTSS (95% CI [.14, 
      .31]). CONCLUSIONS: Self-efficacy to control cannabis use during moments of
      emotional distress could serve a critical role in the relationship between
      cannabis use and PTSS. These results may inform clinical intervention and provide
      survivors with a better understanding of how use impacts recovery. (PsycInfo

TI  - The RESCUE problem solving intervention for stroke caregivers: A mixed-methods
      pilot study.
LID - 10.1037/rep0000460 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: Stroke caregivers face many challenges after a family member
      experiences stroke. Because caregivers play such a crucial role in health care,
      there is a need for more interventions in web-based formats that focus on
      caregiver psycho-education and skills building. A pilot study was devised to
      determine the feasibility, acceptability, and value of an active, 4-week
      telephone and web-based intervention for stroke caregivers. METHOD/DESIGN: A
      one-group, pretest-posttest design with a mixed-methods approach was used.
      Qualitative data supplemented the quantitative findings. Community-dwelling
      caregivers of stroke patients were recruited from the Veterans Health
      Administration. Quantitative data were collected pre and postintervention.
      Semistructured interviews were completed with a subsample of caregivers to
      capture more detail about the acceptability and value of the intervention.
      RESULTS: Ninety-three caregivers were recruited; 72 caregivers completed the
      intervention and 21 withdrew (77% completion rate). From pre- to posttest,
      caregiver depression (p = .008) and caregiver burden (p = .013) decreased.
      Problem-solving abilities and health-related quality of life showed no change.
      Seventy-eight percent of caregivers rated the intervention sessions with the
      nurses as very helpful or extremely helpful, and 76% reported using the
      problem-solving strategies a moderate amount to extremely often. Interviews
      suggest that the intervention was valuable and led to new strategies to relieve
      stress and prioritize health. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The intervention was
      feasible to implement and acceptable to caregivers. This intervention shows
      promise for fulfilling a need for more web-based interventions that focus on
      skills building and psycho-education, but more rigorous testing is needed to
      determine effectiveness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights

TI  - Significance of low ferritin without anaemia in screen-detected, adult coeliac
      disease patients.
LID - 10.1111/joim.13548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low ferritin without anaemia has been linked to adverse health
      effects. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of
      low ferritin in screen-detected coeliac disease. METHODS: Seventy-six
      screen-detected coeliac disease patients were enrolled in the prospective
      collection of comprehensive clinical, laboratory and histological data at
      diagnosis and after 1-2 years on a gluten-free diet (GFD). All variables were
      compared between patients with different ferritin levels. RESULTS: At coeliac
      disease diagnosis, six patients had anaemia. Of the 70 nonanaemic patients,
      ferritin levels were <15 mug/L in 21%, 15-29 mug/L in 19%, 30-99 mug/L in 36% and
      >/=100 mug/L in 24%. Those with lower ferritin were more often females, had lower
      body mass index, haemoglobin and villous height-crypt depth ratio and also had
      higher intra-epithelial lymphocyte CD3+ levels in duodenal biopsies. The groups
      did not differ in neurological or gastrointestinal symptoms, health-related
      quality of life, bone mineral density, liver values, vitamin, albumin or coeliac 
      autoantibody levels or the prevalence of comorbidities. Median ferritin levels
      increased from 41.5 mug/L to 86.0 mug/L on GFD (p < 0.001). Ferritin remained <30
      mug/L in 21% of patients but was not associated with dietary compliance, nor was 
      any correlation between changes in ferritin and quality of life, gastrointestinal
      symptoms, autoantibody levels or degree of histological damage detected.
      CONCLUSION: Decreased ferritin is a frequent finding in screen-detected coeliac
      disease and may not be fully restored on a GFD. However, low ferritin levels are 
      not associated with more severe symptoms or poorer quality of life.

      testing, myocardial infarction diagnoses, and long-term prognosis.
LID - zuac090 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ehjacc/zuac090 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain
      require evaluation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Atrial fibrillation (AF)
      can lead to troponin (cTn) elevation in the absence of ACS. There is limited
      evidence informing the impact of AF on the diagnostic performance of cTn testing 
      for the diagnosis of Type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI), or the association
      between AF and long-term outcomes in this context. METHODS AND RESULTS: This
      study used the IMPACT and ADAPT study databases to compile a combined cohort of
      3496 adults presenting to ED with chest pain between 2007 and 2014, with early
      cTn testing during ED workup. The mean age was 56.6 years, and 40.2% were female.
      Outcomes included adjudicated diagnoses for the index admission and mortality to 
      1-year after presentation. The specificity of initial cTn testing for T1MI
      diagnosis was lower for patients in AF compared with those not in AF (79.2% vs.
      95.4%, P < 0.001), largely due to a relative increase in Type 2 myocardial
      infarction diagnoses. Sensitivity for T1MI did not differ between patients with
      or without AF (88.5% vs. 91.5%, P = 0.485). AF was associated with increased
      1-year mortality (10.4% vs. 2.3%, P < 0.001), although this was not significant
      on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: The specificity of serial cTn testing for 
      the diagnosis of T1MI in patients presenting to ED with chest pain is reduced in 
      the presence of AF. Further studies are needed to establish whether optimised cTn
      thresholds for patients with AF can improve workup and outcomes.

TI  - Comparing Web-Based Venues to Recruit Gay, Bisexual, and Other Cisgender Men Who 
      Have Sex With Men to a Large HIV Prevention Service in Brazil: Evaluation Study.
PG  - e33309
LID - 10.2196/33309 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Internet and mobile phones, widely available in Brazil, could be used
      to disseminate information about HIV prevention and to recruit gay, bisexual, and
      other cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) to HIV prevention services. Data 
      evaluating the characteristics of MSM recruited through different web-based
      strategies and estimating their cost and yield in the country are not available. 
      OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe a web-based recruitment cascade, compare the
      characteristics of MSM recruited to a large HIV prevention service in Rio de
      Janeiro according to web-based venues, and estimate the cost per participant for 
      each strategy. METHODS: We promoted advertisements on geosocial networking (GSN) 
      apps (Hornet and Grindr) and social media (Facebook and Instagram) from March
      2018 to October 2019. The advertisements invited viewers to contact a peer
      educator to schedule a visit at the HIV prevention service. Performance of
      web-based recruitment cascade was based on how many MSM (1) were reached by the
      advertisement, (2) contacted the peer educator, and (3) attended the service. We 
      used chi-square tests to compare MSM recruited through GSN apps and social media.
      The estimated advertisement cost to recruit a participant was calculated by
      dividing total advertisement costs by number of participants who attended the
      service or initiated preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). RESULTS: Advertisement
      reached 1,477,344 individuals; 1270 MSM contacted the peer educator (86 contacts 
      per 100,000 views)-564 (44.4%), 401 (31.6%) and 305 (24.0%)-through social media,
      Grindr, and Hornet. Among the 1270 individuals who contacted the peer educator,
      36.3% (n=461) attended the service with similar proportion for each web-based
      strategy (social media: 203/564, 36.0%; Grindr: 152/401, 37.9%; and Hornet:
      107/305, 35.1%). MSM recruited through GSN apps were older (mean age 30 years vs 
      26 years; P<.001), more frequently self-reported as White (111/247, 44.9% vs
      62/191, 32.5%; P=.03), and had higher schooling level (postsecondary: 157/254,
      61.8% vs 94/194, 48.5%; P=.007) than MSM recruited through social media. GSN apps
      recruited MSM with higher HIV risk as measured by PrEP eligibility (207/239,
      86.6% vs 133/185, 71.9%; P<.001) compared with social media, but there was no
      difference in PrEP uptake between the two strategies (P=.22). The estimated
      advertisement costs per participant attending the HIV prevention service were US 
      $28.36 for GSN apps and US $12.17 for social media. The estimated advertisement
      costs per participant engaging on PrEP were US $58.77 for GSN apps and US $27.75 
      for social media. CONCLUSIONS: Social media and GSN app advertisements were
      useful to disseminate information on HIV prevention strategies and to recruit MSM
      to a large HIV prevention service in Brazil. Compared to GSN apps, social media
      advertisements were less expensive and reached more vulnerable and younger MSM.
      Digital marketing campaigns should use different and complementary web-based
      venues to reach a plurality of MSM.

TI  - A Web-Based Platform (CareVirtue) to Support Caregivers of People Living With
      Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias: Mixed Methods Feasibility Study.
PG  - e36975
LID - 10.2196/36975 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People living with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD)
      require prolonged and complex care that is primarily managed by informal
      caregivers who face significant unmet needs regarding support for communicating
      and coordinating across their informal care network. To address this unmet need, 
      we developed CareVirtue, which provides (1) the ability to invite care network
      members; (2) a care guide detailing the care plan; (3) a journal where care
      network members can document, communicate, and coordinate; (4) a shared calendar;
      and (5) vetted geolocated caregiver resources. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to
      evaluate CareVirtue's feasibility based on: (1) Who used CareVirtue? (2) How did 
      caregivers use CareVirtue? (3) How did caregivers perceive the acceptability of
      CareVirtue? (4) What factors were associated with CareVirtue use? METHODS: We
      conducted a feasibility study with 51 care networks over a period of 8 weeks and 
      used a mixed methods approach that included both quantitative CareVirtue usage
      data and semistructured interviews. RESULTS: Care networks ranged from 1 to 8
      members. Primary caregivers were predominantly female (38/51, 75%), White (44/51,
      86%), married (37/51, 73%), college educated (36/51, 71%), and were, on average, 
      60.3 (SD 9.8) years of age, with 18% (9/51) living in a rural area. CareVirtue
      usage varied along 2 axes (total usage and type of usage), with heterogeneity in 
      how the most engaged care networks interacted with CareVirtue. Interviews
      identified a range of ways CareVirtue was useful, including practically,
      organizationally, and emotionally. On the Behavioral Intention Scale, 72% (26/36)
      of primary caregivers reported an average score of at least 3, indicating an
      above average intention to use. The average was 81.8 (SD 12.8) for the System
      Usability Scale score, indicating "good" usability, and 3.4 (SD 1.0) for
      perceived usefulness, suggesting above average usefulness. The average confidence
      score increased significantly over the study duration from 7.8 in week 2 to 8.9
      in week 7 (P=.005; r=0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.95). The following sociodemographic
      characteristics were associated with posting in the journal: retired (mean 59.5
      posts for retired caregivers and mean 16.9 for nonretired caregivers), income
      (mean 13 posts for those reporting >US $100K and mean 55.4 for those reporting
      <US $100K), relationship to care recipient (mean 18.7 posts for child and mean
      56.4 for partners/spouses), and living situation (mean 44.7 for those who live
      with the care recipient and mean 13.1 for those who do not). Older care
      recipients were associated with fewer posts (r=-0.33, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.06).
      CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes the acceptability and feasibility of
      CareVirtue among ADRD care networks and highlights the importance of designing
      flexible, multicomponent interventions that allow care networks to tailor their
      engagement according to their needs. The results will be used to improve
      CareVirtue feasibility and acceptability in preparation for a subsequent
      randomized trial to test CareVirtue's effectiveness in improving caregiver
      outcomes.

TI  - Prediction of VO2max From Submaximal Exercise Using the Smartphone Application
      Myworkout GO: Validation Study of a Digital Health Method.
PG  - e38570
LID - 10.2196/38570 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity remains the largest risk factor for the
      development of cardiovascular disease worldwide. Wearable devices have become a
      popular method of measuring activity-based outcomes and facilitating behavior
      change to increase cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) or maximal oxygen consumption 
      (VO2max) and reduce weight. However, it is critical to determine their accuracy
      in measuring these variables. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the
      accuracy of using a smartphone and the application Myworkout GO for submaximal
      prediction of VO2max. METHODS: Participants included 162 healthy volunteers: 58
      women and 104 men (17-73 years old). The study consisted of 3 experimental tests 
      randomized to 3 separate days. One-day VO2max was assessed with Metamax II, with 
      the participant walking or running on the treadmill. On the 2 other days, the
      application Myworkout GO used standardized high aerobic intensity interval
      training (HIIT) on the treadmill to predict VO2max. RESULTS: There were no
      significant differences between directly measured VO2max (mean 49, SD 14
      mL/kg/min) compared with the VO2max predicted by Myworkout GO (mean 50, SD 14
      mL/kg/min). The direct and predicted VO2max values were highly correlated, with
      an R(2) of 0.97 (P<.001) and standard error of the estimate (SEE) of 2.2
      mL/kg/min, with no sex differences. CONCLUSIONS: Myworkout GO accurately
      calculated VO2max, with an SEE of 4.5% in the total group. The submaximal HIIT
      session (4 x 4 minutes) incorporated in the application was tolerated well by the
      participants. We present health care providers and their patients with a more
      accurate and practical version of health risk estimation. This might increase
      physical activity and improve exercise habits in the general population.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitude, Practices, and Vaccine Hesitancy Among the Latinx Community 
      in Southern California Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey.
PG  - e38351
LID - 10.2196/38351 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Latinx population in the United States has experienced high rates
      of infection, hospitalization, and death since the beginning of the COVID-19
      pandemic. There is little data on the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP)
      specifically in Latinx communities in the United States. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to
      assess COVID-19 KAP and vaccine hesitancy among a Latinx cohort in the early
      stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (from July 2020 to October 2020), at a unique
      time when a vaccine was not available. METHODS: Participants aged >/=18 years
      were recruited at a primary care clinic in Southern California and asked to
      self-report sociodemographic characteristics, KAP, and vaccine hesitancy. A
      subset of the participants answered the vaccine hesitancy assessment as it was
      added after the start of data collection. KAP items were summed to create
      composite scores, with higher scores reflecting increased COVID-19 knowledge,
      positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, and disease prevention
      practices. Bivariate and multivariable regression models were fitted to test
      associations between sociodemographic characteristics and KAP scores. For our
      analysis, we only included patients who self-identified as Latinx. RESULTS: Our
      final data set included 265 participants. The participants had a mean age of 49
      (IQR 38.5-59) years, and 72.1% (n=191) were female, 77% (n=204) had at most a
      high school degree, 34.7% (n=92) had an annual income <US $25,000, and 11.7%
      (n=31) had previously tested positive for COVID-19. We found high knowledge
      regarding transmission and spread; moderate knowledge regarding symptoms
      awareness; overall negative attitudes, which included high pessimism in
      government public health efforts and high amounts of fear, anxiety, and
      frustration due to COVID-19 pandemic; and moderate participation in preventive
      practices. A college education was positively associated with a higher knowledge 
      score than those without a college education (beta=0.14, 95% CI 0.01-1.60; P=.04)
      when adjusted for covariates. Male gender had a positive association with
      COVID-19 attitude scores compared to female gender (beta=1.61, 95% CI 0.50-2.72; 
      P=.05), and male gender was negatively associated with the COVID-19 practices
      score compared to female gender (beta=-0.16, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.06; P=.03), when 
      both were adjusted for covariates. Among a subset of 203 patients, 26.6% (n=54)
      indicated that if the vaccine was available, they would not take a COVID-19
      vaccine, and 18.7% (n=38) were unsure. CONCLUSIONS: Good knowledge and
      preventative practices in the population may have reflected effective public
      health messaging and the implementation of public health laws during the first
      wave of the pandemic; however, the overall fear and anxiety may have reflected
      the negative impact that the pandemic had on vulnerable populations such as the
      Latinx community. Although our data are a reflection of a previous time in the
      pandemic, we believe it captures a critical time that can be used to provide
      unique insights regarding potential avenues to better protect the Latinx
      communities against future vaccine-resistant COVID-19 strains. INTERNATIONAL

TI  - Echocardiographic predictors of presence of cardiac amyloidosis in aortic
      stenosis.
LID - jeac146 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ehjci/jeac146 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Aortic stenosis (AS) and cardiac amyloidosis (CA) frequently coexist but
      the diagnosis of CA in AS patients remains a diagnostic challenge. We aim to
      evaluate the echocardiographic parameters that may aid in the detection of the
      presence of CA in AS patients. METHOD AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic
      literature search of electronic databases for peer-reviewed articles from
      inception until 10 January 2022. Of the 1449 patients included, 160 patients had 
      both AS-CA whereas the remaining 1289 patients had AS-only. The result of our
      meta-analyses showed that interventricular septal thickness [standardized mean
      difference (SMD): 0.74, 95% CI: 0.36-1.12, P = 0.0001), relative wall thickness
      (SMD: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.17-1.30, P < 0.0001), posterior wall thickness (SMD: 0.74, 
      95% CI 0.51 to 0.97, P = 0.0011), LV mass index (SMD: 1.62, 95% CI: 0.63-2.62, P 
      = 0.0014), E/A ratio (SMD: 4.18, 95% CI: 1.91-6.46, P = 0.0003), and LA dimension
      (SMD: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.43-1.02, P < 0.0001)] were found to be significantly higher
      in patients with AS-CA as compared with AS-only patients. In contrast, myocardial
      contraction fraction (SMD: -2.88, 95% CI: -5.70 to -0.06, P = 0.045), average
      mitral annular S' (SMD: -1.14, 95% CI: -1.86 to -0.43, P = 0.0017), tricuspid
      annular plane systolic excursion (SMD: -0.36, 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.09, P =
      0.0081), and tricuspid annular S' (SMD: -0.77, 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.42, P <
      0.0001) were found to be significantly lower in AS-CA patients. CONCLUSION:
      Parameters based on echocardiography showed great promise in detecting CA in
      patients with AS. Further studies should explore the optimal cut-offs for these
      echocardiographic variables for better diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - Evaluation of type 2 diabetes care management in nine primary care practices
      before and after implementation of the Criteria of Good Disease Management of
      Diabetes established by the Swiss Society of Endocrinology and Diabetology.

AB  - AIMS OF THE STUDY: Little is known about the quality of diabetes management of
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Swiss primary care. Based on the
      recommendations of the National Council Quality Assurance Programme, an
      interprofessional working group of the Swiss Society of Endocrinology and
      Diabetology (SSED) established population-based national criteria for good
      disease management of T2DM in primary health care (the diabetes score). The
      objective of this study was to assess whether the implementation of these
      criteria improve diabetes management in primary care. METHODS: The diabetes score
      comprises eight criteria including three biometric measurements, two
      lifestyle-specific items and screening of three diabetes-associated
      complications. Practices can evaluate adherence to the criteria based on a point 
      system, with the recommended aim to achieve >/=70/100 points. Group practices and
      single practices were included in this study and started implementing the SSED
      criteria in January 2018. The resulting score was compared with data
      retrospectively obtained for 2017. The primary endpoint was the overall change in
      Diabetes Score between 2017 and 2018 at each practice, further stratified by
      practice type. The absolute effect on individual diabetes score criteria was
      assessed by pooling all patient-level data. RESULTS: Nine practices (six single
      and three group) participated in the study. In 2017 and 2018, the primary care
      practices treated 727 and 704 patients with T2DM, respectively, of whom 676 were 
      treated both years. Around half of the patients were cared for in group practices
      and half in single practices. Between 2017 and 2018 the median (interquartile
      range) diabetes score improved from 40 (35, 65) to 55 (45, 70; p = 0.078). One
      practice (single) obtained a score >/=70 in 2017, three practices (all single)
      achieved this target in 2018. Pooling patient-level data, we observed a
      significant absolute improvement in the following criteria: number of regular
      diabetes check ups, body mass index, glycated haemoglobin, blood pressure, low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol and screenings for diabetes-associated
      complications (all p <0.05). However, the extent of the improvements were often
      insufficient to reach the prefixed targets of the diabetes score criteria on the 
      practice level. CONCLUSION: Overall, the implementation of the SSED criteria in
      the current setting led to a modest, nonsignificant improvement of the diabetes
      score. Only three (all single practices) out of the nine practices reached the
      recommended 70-point target, indicating that further strategies are needed to
      improve diabetes care in primary care practice. Trial registration:
      ClinicalTrials.gov (ID NCT04216875).

TI  - Zinc supplementation improves antioxidant status, and organic zinc is more
      efficient than inorganic zinc in improving the bone strength of aged laying hens.
LID - 10.1002/vms3.896 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been some reports indicating that supplementation of zinc 
      could alleviate the negative effects of age on egg quality in laying hens.
      However, information regarding these positive effects on health and zinc
      deposition in the body is limited. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was
      to investigate the effect of organic and inorganic sources of zinc on the
      antioxidant activity, bone strength, and zinc deposition in the tissues of older 
      laying hens. METHODS: In a completely randomized design, 175 Leghorn laying hens 
      (w36) aged 80 weeks were allocated into seven treatment groups and five
      replications: control (without zinc supplementation), zinc sulphate treatments
      (15, 30, and 45 mg/kg), and organic zinc treatments (15, 30, and 45 mg/kg).
      RESULTS: There was a significant increase in feed intake in the zinc sulphate and
      organic zinc treatments compared to the control treatment (p < 0.05). The egg
      mass in organic and sulphate zinc showed a significant increase. The feed
      conversion ratio was decreased significantly in the organic zinc treatments (p < 
      0.05). Both organic and sulphate zinc supplements enhanced serum superoxide
      dismutase activity as an antioxidant index (p < 0.05). The cortical thickness of 
      the tibia was improved in laying hens receiving 30 mg/kg organic zinc.
      Supplementation of zinc could lead to an increase in zinc deposition in tissues, 
      and organic zinc boosts bone strength. CONCLUSION: Zinc supplementation can
      improve antioxidant activity, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio and enhance 
      egg mass and optimal absorption of zinc in tissues. The use of 30 mg/kg organic
      zinc is recommended for improving the cortical thickness of the tibia in aged
      laying hens.

TI  - Immunotherapy After Chemotherapy and Radiation for Clinical Stage III Lung
      Cancer.
PG  - e2224478
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.24478 [doi]
AB  - Importance: The 2017 international PACIFIC trial established a role for
      immunotherapy after chemoradiation for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). However, in the US, patients with NSCLC commonly differ from
      clinical trial populations in terms of age, health, access to care, and treatment
      course, which may all factor into the efficacy of immunotherapy. Objective: To
      determine the outcomes of immunotherapy use in unresectable stage III NSCLC in
      the general US population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study
      analyzed the National Cancer Database for patients diagnosed with clinical stage 
      III NSCLC between 2015 and 2017 with follow-up through the end of 2018 who were
      treated with chemotherapy and radiation. Data were analyzed January 2022. Main
      Outcomes and Measures: Mortality hazard in a multivariable Cox proportional
      hazards model and survival among a propensity-matched sample treated with
      chemotherapy and radiation, with and without immunotherapy. Results: A total of
      23811 patients with clinical stage III NSCLC with median (IQR) age 66 (59-72)
      years met inclusion criteria (10454 [43.9%] women; 564 [2.4%] Asian, 2930 [12.3%]
      Black, 20077 [84.3%] White patients), including 209 (16.1%) patients with
      multiple comorbidities and 1297 (5.4%) immunotherapy recipients. Immunotherapy
      after chemotherapy and radiation was associated with reduced mortality (hazard
      ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67-0.82; P < .001). Among a propensity-matched
      sample, immunotherapy was associated with superior 3-year survival (52% [1297
      patients at 0 months, 56 patients at 36 months] vs 44% [2594 patients at 0
      months, 173 patients at 36 months]; P < .001). The treatment of 833 patients who 
      received immunotherapy (64.2%) differed from the PACIFIC trial protocol,
      including 221 patients (17.0%) who received radiation doses outside of the
      protocol range and 731 patients (56.4%) who started immunotherapy more than 6
      weeks after radiation was completed. The survival advantage of immunotherapy
      persisted when initiated up to 12 weeks after radiation was completed (HR, 0.75; 
      95% CI, 0.61-0.92). Among patients who received radiation outside the PACIFIC
      protocol range, the survival advantage of immunotherapy was not significant (HR, 
      0.87; 95% CI, 0.69-1.01). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study,
      immunotherapy after chemotherapy and radiation for stage III NSCLC was associated
      with a survival advantage in the general US population despite two-thirds of
      patients treated differently than the PACIFIC protocol. The findings suggest
      there may be flexibility in the timing of immunotherapy initiation after
      radiation; further study is warranted to clarify the clinical benefits of
      immunotherapy.

TI  - Analysis of Pregnancy-Related Attacks in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder: 
      A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e2225438
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25438 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Risk of relapse may be increased in the postpartum period of
      neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Information regarding factors
      associated with pregnancy-related attacks is still lacking. Objectives: To
      identify factors associated with pregnancy-related NMOSD attacks, investigate the
      integrated annualized relapse rate (ARR) and Expanded Disability Status Scale
      (EDSS) score in each phase of pregnancy, and summarize pregnancy outcomes and
      complications in patients with NMOSD. Data Sources: An electronic search was
      performed in the MEDLINE, PubMed in-process and non-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of
      Science, and Cochrane databases using the OvidSP search platform, updated through
      December 30, 2021. Study Selection: All published and unpublished studies in
      English were considered, covering all patients with NMOSD with an informative
      pregnancy. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers extracted the
      published data with a standardized procedure following MOOSE and PRISMA
      guidelines. The end points were calculated with the DerSimonian and Laird inverse
      variance (for random effects) method. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary
      outcome was the rate of pregnancies with pregnancy-related NMOSD attacks,
      measured by risk ratios (RRs). The mean differences (MDs) in ARR and EDSS scores 
      between each phase of pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and complications were
      defined as the secondary outcomes. Results: A total of 15 studies were analyzed, 
      including 443 patients with NMOSD with 639 informative pregnancies. Patients
      receiving immunosuppressive treatment during pregnancy (RR, 0.43; 95% CI,
      0.32-0.57; P < .001) and with older age at conception (RR, 0.67; 95% CI,
      0.47-0.95; P = .02) had lower rates of pregnancy with pregnancy-related attacks. 
      The increase in the ARR was highest in the first trimester after delivery
      compared with before pregnancy (MD, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.94-1.62; P < .001). The EDSS 
      scores increased significantly both during pregnancy (MD, 0.44; 95% CI,
      0.20-0.69; P < .001) and in the postpartum period (MD, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.51-1.26; P
      < .001) compared with before pregnancy. Conclusions and Relevance: This
      systematic review and meta-analysis found that receiving immunosuppressive
      treatment during pregnancy and older age at conception were associated with
      reduced risk of pregnancy-related NMOSD attacks, which mostly occurred in the
      first trimester of the postpartum period, although more high-quality prospective 
      studies are needed.

TI  - Venetoclax and Hypomethylating Agents as First-line Treatment in Newly Diagnosed 
      Patients with AML in a Predominately Community Setting in the US.
LID - oyac135 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyac135 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment with venetoclax + hypomethylating agents (HMAs) is
      standard-of-care for newly diagnosed (ND) patients with acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) aged >/=75 years, or with comorbidities precluding intensive chemotherapy. 
      We describe real-world venetoclax + HMA treatment practices and outcomes in
      patients with ND AML in the US. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort
      study used an electronic health record-derived, US nationwide, de-identified
      database, and included adults with ND AML, initiating venetoclax + HMA treatment 
      </=30 days from diagnosis (June 1, 2018-January 31, 2020). Venetoclax treatment
      variables included dosing information, schedule modifications, and drug-drug
      interactions. The median venetoclax + HMA treatment duration and overall survival
      (OS) from venetoclax initiation to discontinuation, death, or end of follow-up
      (August 31, 2020) were examined by Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 169
      patients were included. The median age at diagnosis was 77 years; 85.2% of
      patients were treated in community practice. Ninety-five of 169 patients (56.2%) 
      had evaluable bone marrow response data following the start of treatment; 53.7%
      were assessed approximately at the end of cycle 1. Following the first treatment 
      cycle, treatment schedule modifications were recorded in 101 patients and dose
      changes in 56, primarily due to toxicity. The median treatment duration was 5.2
      months; the median OS was 8.6 months (median follow-up was 7.2 months).
      Venetoclax dose changes did not modify efficacy outcomes, but longer median OS
      was associated with venetoclax treatment schedule modifications (P = .02).
      CONCLUSIONS: This study reflects early real-world experience with venetoclax +
      HMAs in a predominantly community setting and emphasizes the importance of
      appropriate venetoclax management in optimizing patient outcomes.

TI  - Phenotypic Expression of CFH Rare Variants in Age-Related Macular Degeneration
      Patients in the Coimbra Eye Study.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1167/iovs.63.9.5 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To determine the association between rare genetic variants in complement
      factor H (CFH) and phenotypic features in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 
      patients from the Coimbra Eye Study (CES). Methods: AMD patients from the
      Incidence CES (NCT02748824) underwent ophthalmologic examination and color fundus
      photography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), fundus
      autofluorescence, and near-infrared imaging. Multimodal phenotypic
      characterization was carried out in a centralized reading center. The coding and 
      splice-site regions of the CFH gene were sequenced through single-molecule
      molecular inversion probe-based next-generation sequencing in association with
      the EYE-RISK consortium. Variants with minor allele frequency <0.05 resulting in 
      splice-site or protein change were selected. Differences in phenotypic features
      between carriers and noncarriers were analyzed using generalized estimated
      equations logistic regression models, considering intereye correlations. Results:
      We included 39 eyes of 23 patients carrying rare CFH variants and 284 eyes of 188
      noncarriers. Carrier status was associated with having higher drusen burden in
      the macula in the inner Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study circle (odds
      ratio [OR], 5.44 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.61-18.37]; P = 0.006), outer
      circle (OR, 4.37 [95% CI, 1.07-17.77]; P = 0.04), and full grid (OR, 4.82 [95%
      CI, 1.13-20.52]; P = 0.033). In SD-OCT, a lower total macular volume and lower
      inner retinal layers' volume (OR, 0.449 [95% CI, 0.226-0.894]; P = 0.023; OR,
      0.496 [95% CI, 0.252-0.979]; P = 0.043) and pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs)
      (OR, 5.24 [95% CI, 1.08-25.44]; P = 0.04) were associated with carrying a rare
      CFH variant. Carriers with subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) had the rare
      variant P258L in all cases except one. Conclusions: We identified in our cohort
      phenotypic differences between carriers and noncarriers of rare variants in the
      CFH gene. Carriers had more severe disease, namely superior drusen burden, PEDs, 
      and thinner retinas. The rare variant P258L may be associated with SDD. Carriers 
      are probably at increased risk of progression.

TI  - Effect of Modified Vertical Rectus Belly Transposition vs Augmented Superior
      Rectus Transposition Plus Medial Rectus Recession for Chronic Sixth Nerve Palsy: 
      A Randomized Clinical Trial.
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2022.2856 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Both vertical rectus belly transposition (VRBT) and superior rectus
      transposition (SRT) can be performed simultaneously with ipsilateral medial
      rectus recession (MRc) and have been shown to be effective for chronic sixth
      nerve palsy. However, it is unclear whether VRBT is superior to SRT in correcting
      esotropia. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of modified VRBT plus MRc
      (mVRBT-MRc) vs augmented SRT plus MRc (aSRT-MRc) in Chinese patients with chronic
      sixth nerve palsy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This parallel-design,
      double-masked, single-center, randomized clinical trial was conducted from
      January 15, 2018, to May 24, 2021. The follow-up visits were scheduled at 1 month
      and 6 months. Eligible Chinese participants with unilateral chronic sixth nerve
      palsy were randomly assigned to receive either mVRBT-MRc (VRBT group) or aSRT-MRc
      (SRT group). Interventions: mVRBT-MRc or aSRT-MRc. Main Outcomes and Measures:
      Change of horizontal deviation in primary position from baseline to 6 months.
      Results: Of the total 25 eligible participants, the mean (SD) age was 45.4 (12.6)
      years, with 10 male participants (40%) and 15 female participants (60%). Thirteen
      participants (52%) were randomly assigned to the VRBT group, and 12 (48%) were
      randomly assigned to the SRT group. At baseline, the mean (SD) horizontal
      deviation was 65.7 (10.8) prism diopters (Delta) in the VRBT group and
      60.5Delta(14.1Delta) in the SRT group. Similar amounts of MRc were performed in
      both groups. At 6 months, the horizontal deviation changed from baseline by
      66.3Delta in the VRBT group and by 51.5Delta in the SRT group. The adjusted group
      difference was 10.9Delta (95% CI, 5.3Delta-16.6Delta), favoring the VRBT group (P
      = .001). Four times as many participants corrected more than 60Delta with
      mVRBT-MRc compared with aSRT-MRc. The group difference of the improvement of
      abduction limitation was -0.2 (95% CI, -0.8 to 0.5; P = .64). Although there was 
      a higher proportion of undercorrection in the SRT group (difference, 45%; 95% CI,
      16%-75%; P = .01), no differences were identified for other suboptimal outcomes
      between groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with aSRT-MRc, mVRBT-MRc
      showed better effect in correcting esotropia with no differences detected for
      other suboptimal outcomes. mVRBT-MRc may be a promising alternative surgical
      procedure for chronic sixth nerve palsy, particularly for large esotropia of more
      than 60Delta, if these results are confirmed in larger, diverse cohorts with
      longer follow-up. Trial Registration: ChiCTR Identifier: ChiCTR-INR-17013705.

TI  - Association Between Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening and Prostate Cancer
      Mortality Among Non-Hispanic Black and Non-Hispanic White US Veterans.
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2022.2970 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Black men have higher prostate cancer incidence and mortality than
      non-Hispanic White men. However, Black men have been underrepresented in clinical
      trials of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening; thus, there is a lack of
      data to guide screening recommendations for this population. Objective: To assess
      whether PSA screening is associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer-specific
      mortality (PCSM) among non-Hispanic Black men. Design, Setting, and Participants:
      This retrospective cohort study used data from the US Veterans Health
      Administration Informatics and Computing Infrastructure for men aged 55 to 69
      years who self-identified as non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White and were
      diagnosed with intermediate-, high-, or very high-risk prostate cancer from
      January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from August 2021 to
      March 2022. Exposures: Prostate-specific antigen screening rate, defined as the
      percentage of years in which PSA screening was conducted during the 5 years
      before diagnosis of prostate cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary
      outcome was risk of PCSM among Black men and White men. The association between
      PSA screening and risk of PCSM was assessed using Fine-Gray regression analysis. 
      Risk of PCSM was also assessed categorically among patients classified as having 
      no prior PSA screening, some screening (less than annual), or annual screening in
      the 5 years before diagnosis. Results: The study included 45834 veterans (mean
      [SD] age, 62.7 [3.8] years), of whom 14310 (31%) were non-Hispanic Black men and 
      31524 (69%) were non-Hispanic White men. The PSA screening rate was associated
      with a lower risk of PCSM among Black men (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR],
      0.56; 95% CI, 0.41-0.76; P = .001) and White men (sHR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46-0.75; P
      = .001). On subset analysis, annual screening (vs some screening) was associated 
      with a significant reduction in risk of PCSM among Black men (sHR, 0.65; 95% CI, 
      0.46-0.92; P = .02) but not among White men (sHR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74-1.11; P =
      .35). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, PSA screening was
      associated with reduced risk of PCSM among non-Hispanic Black men and
      non-Hispanic White men. Annual screening was associated with reduced risk of PCSM
      among Black men but not among White men, suggesting that annual screening may be 
      particularly important for Black men. Further research is needed to identify
      appropriate populations and protocols to maximize the benefits of PSA screening.

      oral fexinidazole in adults with chronic indeterminate Chagas disease.
LID - ciac579 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac579 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chagas disease (CD) has significant global health impact, but safe
      and effective treatments remain elusive. The nitroimidazole fexinidazole is a
      potential treatment. METHODS: This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
      dose-finding, proof-of-concept study was conducted in Bolivia. Adults with
      serologically-confirmed chronic indeterminate CD and positive PCR were randomly
      assigned to one of six fexinidazole regimens (1200 or 1800 mg/day for 2, 4, or 8 
      weeks) or placebo. Target recruitment was 20 patients/arm. The primary endpoint
      was sustained parasitological clearance by serial negative qPCR from end of
      treatment (EOT) until 6 months follow-up in the intention-to-treat population
      (ITT). Follow-up was extended to 12 months. RESULTS: Enrollment was interrupted
      after 4/47 patients presented with transient asymptomatic grade-3 and 4
      neutropenia. Treatment of ongoing patients was stopped in all patients
      administered >2 weeks. A total of 40 patients received from 3 days to 8 weeks of 
      treatment with fexinidazole. Delayed onset neutropenia (n = 8) and increased
      liver enzymes (n = 8) were found in fexinidazole patients, versus none in the
      placebo arm. In the ITT analysis, sustained parasitological clearance from EOT to
      12 months follow-up varied between 66.7% ("1200mg-2week") and 100.0%
      ("1800mg-2week"). Rapid, sustained clearance of parasitemia was observed in all
      treated patients with available data, but not in any patients in the placebo
      group, at 12 months (p = 0.0056). Further exploratory exposure-response analysis 
      suggested low dosages of fexinidazole may be safe and effective. CONCLUSIONS:
      Further evaluation is needed to establish fexinidazole's minimum effective dosage
      and risk-benefit relationship. Results suggest potential for effective treatment 
      regimens of <10 days.

TI  - The prevalence and risk factors of screen-based disordered eating among
      university students: a global systematic review, meta-analysis, and
      meta-regression.
LID - 10.1007/s40519-022-01452-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to estimate the prevalence of
      screen-based disordered eating (SBDE) and several potential risk factors in
      university undergraduate students around the world. METHODS: An electronic search
      of nine data bases was conducted from the inception of the databases until 1st
      October 2021. Disordered eating was defined as the percentage of students scoring
      at or above established cut-offs on validated screening measures. Global data
      were also analyzed by country, research measure, and culture. Other confounders
      in this review were age, BMI, and sex. RESULTS: Using random-effects
      meta-analysis, the mean estimate of the distribution of effects for the
      prevalence of SBDE among university students (K = 105, N = 145,629) was [95% CI] 
      = 19.7% [17.9%; 21.6%], I(2) = 98.2%, Cochran's Q p value = 0.001. Bayesian
      meta-analysis produced an estimate of 0.24, 95% credible intervals [0.20, 0.30], 
      tau = 92%. Whether the country in which the students were studying was Western or
      non-Western did not moderate these effects, but as either the mean BMI of the
      sample or the percentage of the sample that was female increased, the prevalence 
      of SBDE increased. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support previous studies
      indicating that many undergraduate students are struggling with disordered eating
      or a diagnosable eating disorder, but are neither receiver effective prevention
      nor accessing accurate diagnosis and available treatment. It is particularly
      important to develop ever more valid ways of identifying students with high
      levels of disordered eating and offering them original or culturally appropriate 
      and effective prevention or early treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I, systematic
      review and meta-analysis.

TI  - Cognitive impairment in people with epilepsy: Montreal Cognitive Assessment
      (MoCA) as a screening tool.
LID - 10.1007/s13760-022-02046-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although cognitive impairment is common in people with epilepsy, it
      is often neglected in outpatient clinics. MoCA is a simple and reliable test,
      which was validated for the cognitive screening of Alzheimer's and vascular
      dementia. The aim of our study was to evaluate MoCA as a tool for a cognitive
      screening of people with epilepsy. METHODS: Our study included 50 people with
      epilepsy and 46 healthy individuals. All participants took the Slovenian version 
      of the MoCA. Mean age, education and MoCA scores were compared between the two
      groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between people with epilepsy
      and the controls in age (47.6, SD 18.1 vs 50.9, SD 14.0 years) or education
      (12.8, SD 2.8 vs 13.4, SD 2.8 years). People with epilepsy had significantly
      lower total MoCA scores than did the controls (23.3, SD 4.5 vs 27.5, SD 1.9
      points; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: People with epilepsy achieved a lower score in
      several cognitive domains compared to the control group. MoCA can be used as an
      appropriate screening tool for cognitive impairment in people with epilepsy in
      the outpatient clinic. For a more accurate evaluation, neuropsychological
      assessments should be used.

TI  - Alpinumisoflavone against cancer pro-angiogenic targets: In silico, In vitro, and
      In ovo evaluation.
LID - 10.1007/s40199-022-00445-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is currently the world's most predominant malignancy.
      In cancer progression, angiogenesis is a requirement for tumor growth and
      metastasis.Alpinumisoflavone (AIF), a bioactive isoflavonoid, exhibited good
      binding affinity with the angiogenesis pathway's druggable target through
      molecular docking. OBJECTIVES: To confirm AIF's angiogenesis inhibitory activity,
      cytotoxic potential toward breast cancer cells, and druggability. METHODS:
      Antiangiogenic activity was evaluated in six pro-angiogenic proteins in vitro,
      duck chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in ovo, molecular docking and druggability in
      silico. RESULTS: Findings showed that AIF significantly inhibited (p = < 0.001)
      the HER2(IC50 = 2.96 microM), VEGFR-2(IC50 = 4.80 microM), MMP-9(IC50 = 23.00
      microM), FGFR4(IC50 = 57.65 microM), EGFR(IC50 = 92.06 microM) and RET(IC50 = >
      200 microM) activity in vitro.AIF at 25 microM-200 microM significantly inhibited
      (p = < 0.001) the total number of branch points (IC50 = 14.25 muM) and mean
      length of tubule complexes (IC50 = 3.52 muM) of duck CAM comparable (p = > 0.001)
      with the positive control 200 microM celecoxib on both parameters.AIF inhibited
      the growth of the estrogen-receptor-positive (ER +) human breast cancer cells
      (MCF-7) by 44.92 +/- 1.79% at 100 microM while presenting less toxicity to human 
      dermal fibroblast neonatal (HDFn) normal cells.The positive control 100 microM
      doxorubicin showed 86.66 +/- 0.93% and 92.97 +/- 1.27% inhibition with MCF-7
      (IC50 = 3.62 muM) and HDFn, (IC50 = 27.16 muM) respectively.In docking, AIF has
      the greatest in silico binding affinity on HER2 (-10.9 kcal/mol) among the key
      angiogenic molecules tested. In silico rat oral LD50 calculation indicates that
      AIF is moderate to slightly toxic at 146.4 mg/kg with 1.1 g/kg and 20.1 mg/kg
      upper and lower 95% confidence limits. Lastly, it sufficiently complies with
      Lipinski's, Veber's, Egan's, Ghose's, and Muegge's Rule, supporting its oral
      drug-like property. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that AIF possesses
      characteristics of a phytoestrogen compound with significant binding affinity,
      inhibitory activity against pro-angiogenic proteins, and cytotoxic potential
      against ER + breast cancer cells.The acceptable and considerable safety and
      drug-likeness profiles of AIF are worthy of further confirmation in vivo and
      advanced pre-clinical studies so that AIF can be elevated as a promising molecule
      for breast cancer therapy.

TI  - Are ovarian responses and the number of transferable embryos different in females
      and partners of male balanced translocation carriers?
LID - 10.1007/s10815-022-02563-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare ovarian response and the number of transferable embryos
      between women with balanced autosomal translocations and women whose partners
      carry the translocation (control group). To investigate the predictive value of
      metaphase II (MII) oocyte number and biopsied embryo number for gaining at lowest
      one transferable embryo. DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed 1942 preimplantation
      genetic testing for structural rearrangements (PGT-SR) cycles of 1505 balanced
      autosomal translocation couples over 8 years. All cycles were divided into two
      subgroups: Robertsonian and reciprocal translocations (ROBT and ReBT). Receiver
      operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to ascertain a cutoff of MII
      oocytes and biopsied embryos as predictors of gaining at lowest one transferable 
      embryo. RESULT: There were no statistical differences in baseline features or
      ovarian response indicators regarding the number of retrieved/MII oocytes, E2
      level on the day of HCG, and ovarian sensitivity index (OSI) between women with
      balanced autosomal translocations and control group (P > 0.05). A decreased
      number of transferable embryos were found in women with balanced autosomal
      translocations regardless of the type of translocation. The cutoff values for
      gaining at lowest one transferable embryo are 12.5 MII oocytes and 4.5 biopsied
      embryos, respectively. CONCLUSION: Women with balanced autosomal translocations
      have a normal ovarian response, but fewer transferable embryos, meaning that
      higher gonadotropin (Gn) doses may be required to increase transferable embryos. 
      When fewer than 12.5 MII oocytes or 4.5 blastocysts are obtained in a PGT-SR
      cycle, couples should be notified that the likelihood of gaining a transferable
      embryo is low.

TI  - Neoadjuvant Therapy Versus Upfront Resection for Nonpancreatic Periampullary
      Adenocarcinoma.
LID - 10.1245/s10434-022-12257-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In contrast to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), neoadjuvant
      therapy (NAT) for periampullary adenocarcinomas is not well studied, with data
      limited to single-institution retrospective reviews with small cohorts. We sought
      to compare outcomes of NAT versus upfront resection (UR) for non-PDAC
      periampullary adenocarcinomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the National Cancer
      Database (NCDB), we identified patients who underwent surgery for extrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma, ampullary adenocarcinoma, or duodenal adenocarcinoma from
      2006 to 2016. We compared outcomes between NAT versus UR groups for each tumor
      subtype with 1:3 propensity score matching. Cox regression was used to identify
      predictors of survival. RESULTS: Among 7656 patients who underwent resection for 
      non-PDAC periampullary adenocarcinoma, the proportion of patients who received
      NAT increased from 6 to 11% for cholangiocarcinoma (p < 0.01), 1 to 4% for
      ampullary adenocarcinoma (p = 0.01), and 5 to 8% for duodenal adenocarcinoma (p =
      0.08). Length of stay, readmission, and 30-day mortality were comparable between 
      NAT and UR. All tumor subtypes were downstaged following NAT (p < 0.01). The R0
      resection rate was significantly higher in patients with extrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma who received NAT, and these patients had improved median
      overall survival (38 vs 26 months, p < 0.001). After adjustment for
      clinicopathologic factors and adjuvant chemotherapy, use of NAT was associated
      with improved survival in patients with cholangiocarcinoma [hazard ratio (HR)
      0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.89, p = 0.004] but not duodenal or
      ampullary adenocarcinoma. The survival advantage for cholangiocarcinoma persisted
      after propensity matching. CONCLUSION: This national cohort analysis suggests,
      for the first time, that neoadjuvant therapy is associated with improved survival
      in patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

TI  - Preservation of endocrine function after Ommaya reservoir insertion in children
      with cystic craniopharyngioma.
LID - 10.1007/s11060-022-04099-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Children with craniopharyngiomas (CP) can experience significant
      morbidities caused by extensive surgery and/or radiation. Ommaya reservoir
      insertion (ORI) into cystic CP represents a minimally invasive approach allowing 
      immediate decompression and aims to avoid additional injuries. The purpose of
      this study was to determine the surgical outcome and relevance of upfront ORI
      (+/- intracystic treatment) for preservation of endocrine function. METHODS: We
      performed a retrospective chart review of children with CP treated at the
      Hospital for Sick Children between 01/01/2000 and 15/01/2020. Endocrine function 
      was reviewed at the time of initial surgery and throughout follow-up. New
      endocrinological deficits related to the index procedure were defined as
      immediate failure (IF), whereas postoperative duration of endocrinological
      stability (ES) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The rate of IF and ES 
      was compared between the treatment groups. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were
      included and had a median age of 8.3 years (range 2.1-18.0 years); 31 were males.
      Fifty-three patients with upfront surgical treatment, including 29 ORI and 24
      gross total or partial resections had sufficient endocrinological follow-up data.
      Endocrine dysfunction occurring immediately after the index procedure (IF) was
      observed in 15 patients (62.5%) in the resection group compared to two patients
      (6.8%) in the ORI group, odds ratio: 0.05 (CI: 0.01-0.26, p < 0.0001). Excluding 
      those with immediate endocrinological deficits, mean ES after ORI was 19.4 months
      (CI: 11.6-34.2), compared to 13.4 months (CI:10.6-NA) after surgical resection.
      CONCLUSIONS: Endocrine function was preserved in patients with upfront ORI (+/-
      intracystic treatment), which was confirmed as a minimally invasive procedure
      with an overall low morbidity profile.

TI  - Outcomes of bidirectional Glenn surgery done without prior cardiac
      catheterization.

LID - 10.1186/s43044-022-00296-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac catheterization is usually done routinely in patients with
      univentricular hearts before palliative Bidirectional Glenn (BDG) surgery. The
      objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients with
      physiological univentricular hearts and restrictive pulmonary flow that did not
      undergo routine cardiac catheterization before BDG with the patients that did
      have cardiac catheterization done. We retrospectively reviewed the data of all
      patients with single ventricle physiology and restrictive pulmonary blood flow
      who underwent BDG surgery from January 2016 till December 2020. Patients were
      divided into two groups: the catheterization and the non-catheterization groups. 
      RESULTS: Out of 93 patients, 25 (27%) underwent BDG surgery without prior cardiac
      catheterization. The median age of patients was ten months, interquartile range
      (IQR) was 5-18 months. Tricuspid atresia represented 36% of the
      non-catheterization group, while unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect and
      hypoplastic left heart syndrome represented 19% and 17.6% of the catheterization 
      group. No patients in the catheterization group were excluded from further BDG
      surgery based on the catheterization data. Moreover, no significant differences
      were found between the patients' groups regarding the length of hospital stay,
      length of intensive care unit stay, postoperative oxygen saturation, or survival 
      (P = 0.266, P = 0.763, P = 0.543, P = 0456). CONCLUSIONS: Although pre-BDG
      cardiac catheterization is the routine and standard practice, in certain
      situations, some patients with single ventricle physiology and restrictive
      pulmonary blood flow may go directly to BDG without cardiac catheterization if
      noninvasive imaging is satisfactory on a case-by-case basis and according to
      center experience. Pre-BDG catheterization could be reserved for patients with
      limited echocardiographic studies, high-risk patients, or those indicated for
      catheter intervention before BDG surgery.

TI  - Perioperative administration of methylprednisolone was associated with
      postoperative pulmonary complications in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture
      surgery.
LID - 10.1007/s40520-022-02166-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) seriously affect the
      postoperative prognosis of elderly patients underwent hip fracture surgery.
      Although methylprednisolone is increasingly used, the association between
      perioperative methylprednisolone and PPCs is still controversial. The study aims 
      to determine whether perioperative administration of methylprednisolone is
      associated with PPCs in elderly patients during hip fracture surgery. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, records of 584 patients (>/= 65 
      years) who underwent hip fracture surgery between January 2013 and October 2020
      were extracted. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis were performed to
      identify the risk factors for PPCs. To further explore the association between
      administration of methylprednisolone and PPCs, 53 patients received
      methylprednisolone and 53 patients without methylprednisolone were matched for
      the confounding factors using propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. The odds 
      ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the above variables were
      analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of PPCs during postoperative hospitalization was
      6.83% (38/556) among the elderly patients following hip fracture surgery.
      Patients with PPCs had higher postoperative mortality rate, longer hospital stay,
      more hospitalization cost, and higher incidence of cardiac arrest (all P < 0.05).
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, hypertension,
      hypoglycemia, hypoproteinemia and perioperative methylprednisolone were
      independent risk factors for PPCs. Moreover, administration of methylprednisolone
      was significantly correlated with PPCs both before PSM adjustment (OR = 3.25; 95%
      CI, 1.67 to 6.33; P = 0.001) and after PSM adjustment (OR = 6.68; 95% CI, 1.40 to
      31.82; P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Perioperative administration of methylprednisolone
      is a risk factor for PPCs in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.

TI  - Primordial germ cell identification and traceability during the initial
      development of the Siluriformes fish Pseudopimelodus mangurus.
LID - 10.1007/s10695-022-01106-z [doi]
AB  - Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are responsible for generating all germ cells.
      Therefore, they are essential targets to be used as a tool for the production of 
      germline chimeras. The labeling and route of PGCs were evaluated during the
      initial embryonic development of Pseudopimelodus mangurus, using whole-mount in
      situ hybridization (WISH) and mRNA microinjection in zygotes. A specific
      antisense RNA probe constituted by a partial coding region from P. mangurus
      nanos3 mRNA was synthesized for the WISH method. RNA microinjection was performed
      using the GFP gene reporter regulated by translation regulatory P. mangurus buc
      and nanos3 3'UTR sequences, germline-specific markers used to describe in vivo
      migration of PGCs. Nanos3 and buc gene expression was evaluated in tissues for
      male and female adults and initial development phases and larvae from the first
      to seventh days post-hatching. The results from the WISH technique indicated the 
      origin of PGCs in P. mangurus from the aggregations of nanos3 mRNA in the
      cleavage grooves and the signals obtained from nanos3 probes corresponded
      topographically to the migratory patterns of the PGCs reported for other fish
      species. Diffuse signals were observed in all blastomeres until the 16-cell
      stage, which could be related to the two sequences of the nanos3 3'UTR observed
      in the P. mangurus unfertilized egg transcriptome. Microinjection was not
      successful using GFP-Dr-nanos1 3'UTR mRNA and GFP-Pm-buc 3'UTR mRNA and allowed
      the identification of potential PGCs with less than 2% efficiency only and after 
      hatching using GFP-Pm-nanos3 3'UTR. Nanos3 and buc gene expression was reported
      in the female gonads and from fertilized eggs until the blastula phase. These
      results provide information about the PGC migration of P. mangurus and the
      possible use of PGCs for the future generation of germline chimeras to be applied
      in the conservation efforts of Neotropical Siluriformes species. This study can
      contribute to establishing genetic banks, manipulating organisms, and assisting
      in biotechnologies such as transplanting germ cells in fish.

TI  - Assessing the effect of environmental and socio-economic factors on skin melanoma
      incidence: an island-wide spatial study in Gran Canaria (Spain), 2007-2018.
LID - 10.1007/s10552-022-01614-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Skin melanoma incidence has risen in the last decades becoming a
      major public health problem in many regions of the world. Geographic variation of
      rates is not well understood. PURPOSE: To assess the spatial distribution of skin
      melanoma in Gran Canaria Island (Canary Islands, Spain) and to evaluate the role 
      of environmental, socio-economic, and demographic factors in this distribution.
      METHODS: We performed a small-area study with disease mapping at the census-tract
      level (CT) in Gran Canaria between 2007 and 2018. After testing for spatial
      autocorrelation, we integrated individual-level health data with census-based
      demographic and socio-economic indicators, and satellite-based environmental
      data. Finally, we assessed the role of demographic, socio-economic and
      environmental factors on skin melanoma incidence using a Bayesian analytical
      framework, with options for non-spatial and spatial random effects. RESULTS: 1058
      patients were diagnosed with invasive skin melanoma in the study period and
      geolocated to a CT (number of CT in Gran Canaria = 565). We found evidence of
      global spatial autocorrelation in skin melanoma incidence (Moran's I = 0.09,
      pseudo p-value = 0.001). A few hotspots were detected, fundamentally in urban
      northern tracts. A radial pattern of high values was also observed in selected
      ravines with historical isolation. Multivariable conditional autoregressive
      models identified urbanicity, percent of females, and a high socio-economic
      status as risk factors for disease. Solar radiation did not show a significant
      role. CONCLUSION: Urbanicity and a high socio-economic status were identified as 
      the main risk factors for skin melanoma. These associations might reflect
      differential melanoma susceptibilities or be explained by health inequalities in 
      detection. This study also uncovered high-risk areas in particular ravines.
      Future targeted research in these regions might help better understand the role
      of genetic and toxic factors in melanoma pathogenesis.

AB  - This study aims to produce, characterize, and assess the antimicrobial activity
      and cytotoxicity of polymer blends based on chitosan (CT) and fish collagen (COL)
      produced by different precipitation methods. Polymer blends were obtained in
      alkaline (NaOH), saline (NaCl), and alkaline/saline (NaOH/NaCl) solutions with
      different CT:COL concentration ratios (20:80, 50:50, and 80:20). The polymer
      blends were characterized by various physicochemical methods and subsequently
      evaluated in terms of their in vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxicity activity. In 
      this study, the degree of chitosan deacetylation was 82%. The total
      hydroxyproline and collagen content in the fish matrix was 47.56 mg. g(-1) and
      394.75 mg. g(-1), respectively. The highest yield was 44% and was obtained for a 
      CT:COL (80:20) blend prepared by precipitation in NaOH. High concentrations of
      hydroxyproline and collagen in the blends were observed when NaOH precipitation
      was used. Microbiological analysis revealed that the strains used in this work
      were sensitive to the biomaterial; this sensitivity was dose-dependent and
      increased with increasing chitosan concentration in the products. The
      biocompatibility test showed that the blends did not reduce the viability of
      fibroblast cells after 48 h of culture. An analysis of the microbiological
      activity of the all-polymer blends showed a decrease in the values of minimal
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) for 
      S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The blends showed biocompatibility with NIH-3T3
      murine fibroblast cells and demonstrated their potential for use in biomedical
      applications such as wound healing, implants, and scaffolds.

TI  - Analysis of fibrinogen concentrate pharmacokinetics and dosing for bleeds and
      surgery in adults, adolescents, and children with congenital afibrinogenaemia and
      hypofibrinogenaemia.
LID - 10.1111/hae.14619 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Congenital afibrinogenaemia and hypofibrinogenaemia are rare
      coagulation disorders where clotting is impaired due to a lack of fibrinogen.
      Consequent bleeding episodes (BEs) are treated using human fibrinogen concentrate
      (HFC). AIM: This post-hoc analysis compared HFC pharmacokinetics (PK) and dosing 
      between patient age groups and defined the in vivo recovery (IVR) for children
      with a- and hypofibrinogenaemia. METHODS: The analysis used data from the
      FORMA-01 (Phase 2), FORMA-02 and FORMA-04 (Phase 3) multinational, prospective,
      open-label studies in patients with a- and hypofibrinogenaemia. HFC PK in
      adults/adolescents (>/=12 years; FORMA-01) and children (<12 years; FORMA-04) was
      examined. Haemostatic efficacy in BE treatment and perioperative prophylaxis was 
      examined in FORMA-02 and FORMA-04 using an objective 4-point scale, with success 
      defined as excellent/good. RESULTS: Median (range) age was 23 years for FORMA-01 
      (12-53; n = 22), 26.5 years for FORMA-02 (12-54; n = 25), and 6 years for
      FORMA-04 (1-10; n = 13). Mean PK parameters were lower for children (AUC, Cmax , 
      IVR; p = .02), while clearance was higher. Median (range) total dose of HFC for
      all BEs was 59.41 mg/kg (32.12-273.80) in adults/adolescents and was 24% higher
      (ns) in children at 73.91 mg/kg (47.45-262.50). Treatment was successful in 98.9%
      of the 89 BEs in adults/adolescents and in 100% of the 10 BEs in children, with
      comparable results for perioperative prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: As expected, HFC PK
      differed between adults/adolescents and children. However, with the higher doses 
      given to children, HFC showed similar efficacy across age groups. Dose adaptation
      based on age groups appears recommendable.

TI  - Immunoglobulin Use for the Management of Painful Peripheral Neuropathy: A
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s40122-022-00416-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulins (IG) are widely used for the treatment of a variety
      of immune-mediated diseases. The exact mechanism of action remains unknown, but
      IG modulate the expression and function of Fc receptors, interfere with
      complement activation and production of cytokines, neutralize pathogenic
      autoantibodies, and affect the activation and effector functions of B and T
      lymphocytes. Immunoglobulins are usually delivered intravenously, and are
      effective in ameliorating motor symptoms, and/or preventing disease progression
      in immune-mediated neuropathies, including Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic
      inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic 
      review and meta-analysis was to study the potential of IG for the treatment of
      painful peripheral neuropathy (PPN). The outcome of interest was the percentage
      of patients with PPN who achieved pain relief following IG administration.
      METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on March 17, 2022, in the
      PubMed database without any publication date restrictions. We also looked for
      unpublished or ongoing trials in clinicaltrials.org. Pain reduction following IG 
      treatment had to be within the aims (primary or secondary). RESULTS: The
      aforementioned literature search strategy revealed five studies (two open-label, 
      three randomized placebo-controlled) eligible to be included. The pooled estimate
      of the percentage of patients with PPN who received immunoglobulins and reported 
      pain relief was found to be 65% (95% CI 58-71%). The likelihood of achieving pain
      relief with immunoglobulin treatment was 2.9 times higher (95% CI 1.6-5.2)
      compared to placebo (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: The use of IG for the treatment of 
      pain due to peripheral neuropathy has a potential therapeutic benefit. Further
      studies across patients with different types of painful peripheral neuropathy are
      needed to better characterize this effect. Registration number on PROSPERO:

TI  - Evaluation of Apelin-13 levels in patients with diabetic nephropathy.
LID - 10.1007/s11255-022-03323-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There is no clear information about the level of Apelin-13 in patients
      with diabetic nephropathy (DN). In this study, we investigated whether there is a
      relationship between Apelin-13 level and the severity of the disease in patients 
      with DN. METHODS: In our case-control study, we included patients who applied to 
      the endocrinology outpatient clinic in 2019. Patients without a history of
      diabetes were determined as the healthy group (group 1). The patients were
      divided into 4 groups according to their microalbumin and creatinine levels.
      Venous blood samples were obtained from all patients for routine laboratory
      parameters and Apelin-13 levels. Homeostatic Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance 
      (HOMA-IR) for insulin resistance was calculated using the formula: plasma glucose
      X insulin level/405. RESULTS: Albumin was found to be significantly lower in
      group 5 (p = 0.032), hemoglobin A1c, microalbumin/creatinine and HOMA-IR values
      were found to be significantly lower in group 1 (p < 0.001 for each). Apelin-13
      level was found to be significantly higher in group 4 and group 5 (p < 0.001). A 
      negative correlation was found between Apelin-13 and GFR (r = - 0.286, p =
      0.003). A positive correlation was found between Apelin-13 and HOMA-IR (r =
      0.309, p = 0.009) and microalbumin/creatinine (r = 0.296, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION:
      In patients with DN, Apelin-13 level increases with the severity of the disease
      and can be used as a biomarker for staging of DN.

TI  - Clinical and Immunological Defects and Outcomes in Patients with Chromosome
      22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.
LID - 10.1007/s10875-022-01340-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common
      microdeletion syndrome in humans and can present with highly variable clinical
      manifestations. Immune deficiencies occur because of thymic hypoplasia or
      aplasia. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with
      22q11.2DS at a medical center between 2000 and 2021. We analyzed the association 
      between clinical phenotypes, immunological abnormalities, age, and outcomes.
      RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with 22q11.2DS had a median diagnostic age of 1.78
      months. Patients presented with congenital heart disease (CHD; 86.2%), major
      infections (75.9%), and failure to thrive (FTT; 58.6%). Autoimmunity,
      neuropsychiatric disorders, and hypoparathyroidism were significantly associated.
      Neonatal seizures were associated with early diagnosis before 2 months (OR 8.56, 
      95% CI 1.21-60.58, P = 0.032). Immunological abnormalities included lymphopenia
      (93.1%), T lymphopenia (71.9%), CD4(+) T lymphopenia (64.1%), a lack of hepatitis
      B vaccine antibodies (46.2%), and complete DiGeorge syndrome (cDGS) (2.3%).
      Severe lymphopenia and T lymphopenia improved at 3 years of age. Two patients
      with cDGS were treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and one
      survived. The mortality rate was 12.8% and the estimated 35-year survival
      probability was 77.5%. Major infections experienced > four times were
      significantly associated with a decreased survival rate of 60%. Patients with CHD
      without FTT or recurrent infections had a better 20-year survival rate (96.2%).
      CONCLUSIONS: CHD, major infection, and FTT were common manifestations and poor
      prognostic factors. Autoimmunity, neuropsychiatric disorders, and
      hypoparathyroidism were significantly associated. Although T lymphopenia may

TI  - A noninvasive scoring model for the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent
      Cushing's syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 311 patients based on easy-to-use
      parameters.
LID - 10.1007/s12020-022-03081-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's disease (CS)
      is challenging. The gold standard approach bilateral inferior petrosal sinus
      sampling (BIPSS) is expensive and invasive, while other noninvasive tests, like
      the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST), provide unsatisfactory
      diagnostic accuracy. This study aimed to find a new noninvasive practical
      approach with higher diagnostic accuracy to differently diagnose ACTH-dependent
      CS, which can be used in centers where BIPSS cannot be applied. METHODS: 264
      Cushing's disease (CD) patients and 47 ectopic ACTH secretion syndrome (EAS)
      patients were analyzed in this single-center retrospective study (2011-2021). The
      multivariate logistic model was used to construct the scoring model. RESULTS:
      Female (adjusted OR 3.030, 95%CI 1.229-7.471), hypokalemia (0.209, 0.076-0.576), 
      ACTH (0.988, 0.982-0.994), MRI pituitary lesion positive (8.671, 3.521-21.352),
      and HDDST positive (2.768, 1.139-6.726) have a strong association with the
      differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent CS and were included in the final
      multivariable logistic regression model. A -14-to-14-point noninvasive scoring
      model was built on the model. The AUC of the noninvasive scoring model was 0.915 
      (95% CI 0.869-0.960), significantly higher than the AUC of HDDST (0.756, 95% CI
      0.685-0.825, P = 0.004). The optimal cutoff of the model was >/=0 to diagnose CD.
      The sensitivity of the noninvasive scoring model was 91.3% (95% CI 87.3%-94.1%), 
      and the specificity was 80.9% (95% CI 67.5%-89.6%). When the model's sensitivity 
      was 100.0%, the cutoff was >/= -10 with a specificity of 19.2%; when the model's 
      specificity was 100.0%, the cutoff was >/= 13 with a sensitivity of 22.7%.
      CONCLUSIONS: We developed a noninvasive scoring model to distinguish CD and EAS
      in ACTH-dependent CS patients with higher diagnostic utility than HDDST in the
      same cohort. The noninvasive scoring model might be applied in areas where BIPSS 
      is unavailable, the CRH is hard to obtain, or the desmopressin stimulation is not
      widely applied. It also provided a triage tool for selecting patients that might 
      benefit the most from a further BIPSS test.

TI  - Research for correlation between heart rate variability parameters and bone
      mineral density in patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
LID - 10.1007/s40618-022-01886-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The relationship of CAN and BMD, fracture risk is still unclear in T2DM.
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the correlation between heart rate
      variability (HRV) and BMD in T2DM. METHODS: The study included 276 patients with 
      T2DM aged >/= 50 years, and Cardiovascular Autonomic Reflex Tests (CARTs) were
      applied to divide patients into two groups: CAN ( +/-). 24 h Ambulatory ECG was
      assessed for HRV, BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray bone densitometry, and
      FRAX scores were calculated for 10-year hip fracture risk (HF(1)) and major
      osteoporotic fracture risk (MOF). Adjusted regression analysis was performed to
      investigate influence factors for BMD and fracture risk. ROC curve was used to
      analyze the optimal cut-off point of LF/HF for screening osteoporosis. RESULTS:
      Baseline data showed significant differences in the duration of T2DM, insulin
      resistance index (HOMA-IR), 25-hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D], femoral neck BMD, hip
      BMD, lumbar BMD, HF(1), and MOF between the CAN ( +) and CAN (-) groups. The
      proportion of patients with osteoporosis increased as the degree of CAN lesion
      increased. Correlation analysis showed that LF/HF was significantly correlated
      with BMD, especially with hip (r = - 0.534, p < 0.001). Regression analysis
      showed that LF/HF was a risk factor for reduced BMD and increased fracture risk. 
      The optimal cut-point value for LF/HF to predict osteoporosis by ROC curve
      analysis was 3.17. CONCLUSIONS: CAN is associated with reduced BMD and increased 
      fracture risk in patients with T2DM, and LF/HF may have the potential to be a
      predictor of diabetic osteoporosis and have some clinical value in early
      diagnosis of diabetic osteoporosis and non-traumatic fractures in T2DM.

TI  - Natural history of subclinical hypothyroidism and prognostic factors for the
      development of overt hypothyroidism: Tehran Thyroid Study (TTS).
LID - 10.1007/s40618-022-01876-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The significance of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is largely due to
      its potential risk for developing overt hypothyroidism (OH). Investigations are
      still exploring predictive factors contributing to the progression of SCH to OH, 
      particularly in patients with mildly elevated serum thyrotropin (TSH). We aimed
      to clarify the natural history of SCH and the predictive factors of its
      progression, based on the grade of SCH severity. METHODS: This study was
      conducted within the framework of the Tehran Thyroid Study (TTS), in which 5783
      individuals aged >/= 20 years were followed. After applying exclusion criteria,
      data of 270 SCH subjects remained for the analysis. Thyroid function tests were
      assessed at baseline and every 3 years. RESULTS: Of 270 participants with SCH,
      239 (88.5%) had TSH level between 5.06 and 10 mU/L, and 31 (11.4%) had TSH >/= 10
      mU/L. During a median follow-up of 10 years, 40% had TSH within the reference
      range, 44% maintained elevated TSH, and 16% had added low T4 to the elevated TSH.
      The annual incidence rate of progression to OH was 22.3 (16.5-101.9) per 1000
      person-years [18 (12.6-25.6) for those with TSH 5.07-9.9 mU/L and 57.8
      (22.8-101.9) for patients with TSH >/= 10 mU/L per 1000 person-years (P =
      0.001)]. After adjusting age, sex, body mass index (BMI), thyroid peroxidase
      antibody (TPOAb), and serum TSH, only TPOAb positivity (HR: 2.31; 95% CI
      1.10-4.83, P = 0.026) and baseline TSH level >/= 10 mU/L (HR: 5.14; 95% CI
      2.14-12.3, P < 0.001) remained as predictors for development of OH. In patients
      with TSH 5.07-9.9 mU/L, TPOAb positivity was associated with an increased risk of
      OH (HR: 2.41; 95% CI 1.10-5.30, P = 0.027). However, in patients with TSH >/= 10 
      mU/L, TPOAb positivity was not a predictor (P = 0.49). CONCLUSION: TPOAb and not 
      TSH are associated with the development of OH in individuals with serum TSH below
      10 mU/L, and follow-up at regular intervals is recommended in TPOAb-positive
      individuals with TSH between 5 and 10 mU/L.

TI  - Distribution of microbial communities in seasonally frozen soil layers on the
      Tibetan Plateau and the driving environmental factors.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22283-7 [doi]
AB  - Large stocks of carbon and nitrogen stored in permafrost regions can potentially 
      feed back to global biogeochemical cycles under climate warming. To understand
      the response of microbial communities to environmental changes, this study
      investigated the spatial distribution of bacterial communities in the upper
      layers (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) of seasonally frozen soil on the Tibetan
      Plateau and their relationships with the environmental factors. A total of 135
      soil samples were collected from the soils at depths of 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm
      in the Lhasa River and Nyang River basins, and the diversity and composition of
      bacterial communities in them were identified by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene
      sequencing. Bacterial diversity changed significantly with soil depth in the
      Nyang River basin (p < 0.001), while no obvious change was found in the Lhasa
      River basin. The whole bacterial composition exhibited small variations across
      different soil layers (p > 0.05). The relative abundance of aerobic bacteria,
      Sphingomonas and Arthrobacter, decreased with soil depth, while that of the other
      aerobic, facultative anaerobic, and anaerobic bacteria did not exhibit this
      trend. Soil pH was the key driving edaphic factor of the whole bacterial
      composition in all three depth layers, while vegetation also had an important
      influence on bacterial composition. Arthrobacter, Bradyrhizobium, and Bacillus
      had obvious correlations with soil nutrients or vegetation, while the other
      species were not significantly correlated with any environmental factors.
      Structural equation modeling revealed that vegetation and mean annual temperature
      had a key direct impact on the bacterial diversity and composition, respectively.
      Climate also indirectly affected bacterial communities, mainly through shaping
      soil pH and vegetation. These results indicate that the soil depth has a
      different impact on the bacterial alpha-diversity, whole bacterial composition,
      and specific taxa in the 0-30-cm surface layers of seasonally frozen soil, which 
      were mainly determined by various environmental factors.

TI  - Insomnia in primary care: a survey conducted on Italian patients older than 50
      years-results from the "Sonno e Salute" study.
LID - 10.1007/s10072-022-06309-z [doi]
AB  - Insomnia affects one-third of the adult population and is associated with
      multiple medical conditions. We conducted an observational epidemiological survey
      to assess (1) the prevalence of insomnia in an Italian group of patients aged
      over 50 years, presenting directly to the general physician (GP); (2) the
      association of insomnia with sleepiness and comorbidities; and (3) the
      pharmacological treatment. The study was carried out by GPs. Each GP was asked to
      enroll the first patient over 50 years old spontaneously presenting for any
      medical problems for 5 consecutive days. The Italian version of the Sleep
      Condition Indicator (SCI) was administered; daytime sleepiness was evaluated by a
      visual analogic scale (VAS). For every patient, GPs collected information
      regarding comorbidities and pharmacological treatment for insomnia and evaluated 
      the severity of insomnia using the Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S)
      scale. A total of 748 patients (mean age 65.12 +/- 9.45 years) were enrolled by
      149 GPs. Prevalence of insomnia was 55.3%. SCI, VAS, and CGI-S scores were highly
      correlated between each other (p < 0.0001). At general linear model analysis, the
      comorbidities more associated with the presence of insomnia were
      anxiety-depressive disorder (p < 0.001), other psychiatric disorders (p = 0.017),
      cardiovascular disorders (p = 0.006), and dementia (p = 0.027). A statistically
      significant correlation was found between SCI score and the use of
      benzodiazepines (p < 0.001), z-drugs (p = 0.012), antidepressants (p < 0.001),
      and melatonin-prolonged release (p < 0.001). Insomnia affects half of Italian
      primary care patients over 50 years and is frequently associated with different
      medical conditions, sleepiness, and use of multiple-often off-label-drugs.

TI  - GM2 gangliosidosis AB variant: first case of late onset and review of the
      literature.
LID - 10.1007/s10072-022-06270-x [doi]
AB  - AB variant is the rarest form of GM2 gangliosidosis, neurodegenerative diseases
      caused by lysosomal accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. Less than thirty cases are 
      referenced in the literature, and to date, no late-onset form has been described.
      Our proband is a 22-year-old male with spinocerebellar ataxia and lower limbs
      motor deficiency. His symptoms started at the age of 10. A genetic analysis
      revealed two mutations in the GM2A gene encoding the GM2 activator protein
      (GM2-AP), an essential co-factor of hexosaminidase A. Both mutations, GM2A:c.79A 
      > T:p.Lys27* and GM2A:c.415C > T:p.Pro139Ser, were inherited respectively from
      his father and his mother. The nonsense mutation was predicted to be likely
      pathogenic, but the missense mutation was of unknown significance. To establish
      the pathogenicity of this variant, we studied GM2 accumulation and GM2A gene
      expression. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence performed on patient's
      fibroblasts did not reveal any lysosomal accumulation of GM2. There was also no
      difference in GM2A gene expression using RT-qPCR, and both mutations were found
      on cDNA Sanger sequencing. Measurement of plasma gangliosides by liquid-phase
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry showed an accumulation of GM2 in our
      patient's plasma at 83.5 nmol/L, and a GM2/GM3 ratio at 0.066 (median of negative
      control at 30.2 nmol/L [19.7-46.8] and 0.019 respectively). Therefore, the
      association of both p.Lys27* and p.Pro169Ser mutations leads to a GM2-AP
      functional deficiency. Whereas the first mutation is more likely to be linked
      with infantile form of GM2 gangliosidosis, the hypomorphic p.Pro169Ser variant
      may be the first associated with a late-onset form of AB variant.

LID - 10.1007/s11626-022-00708-4 [doi]
AB  - Elevated environmental temperatures can induce heat stress which could reduce
      fertility and early embryonic development. Fatty acids can initiate an endergonic
      reaction that absorbs cellular heat and decreases intracellular temperature. This
      study's objective was to minimize heat stress-induced damage to in vitro matured 
      oocytes by supplementing maturation media with either 50 muM linoleic or
      linolenic acid or both (25 or 50 muM) during maturation at either 38.5 or 41.5
      degrees C. Oocytes were evaluated for intracellular antioxidative pathways,
      fertilization characteristics, or early embryonic development. Elevated
      maturation temperatures increased (p < 0.05) reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      formation and supplementation with linoleic or linolenic acid decreased (p <
      0.05) ROS in oocytes matured at 41.5 degrees C. Maturation temperature had an
      effect (p < 0.05) on the intracellular antioxidative pathways of the oocyte
      except for glutathione peroxidase activity. Regardless of maturation temperature,
      supplementation with linoleic or linolenic acid increased (p < 0.05) the enzyme
      activities and glutathione concentrations in the oocytes compared to no fatty
      acid supplementation. Supplementation of both linoleic and linolenic acid
      decreased (p < 0.05) polyspermic fertilization rates. Supplementing either 25 or 
      50 muM linoleic and linolenic acid to maturing oocytes at 41.5 degrees C
      increased (p < 0.05) cleavage rates by 48 h after IVF and the blastocyst
      formation rates by 144 h after IVF compared to other treatments. Oocytes matured 
      at 38.5 degrees C had greater (p < 0.05) embryonic development than those matured
      at 41.5 degrees C except for those supplemented with 50 muM linoleic and
      linolenic acid. Supplementing 50 muM linoleic and linolenic acid to the
      maturation medium of pig oocytes reduces the effects of heat stress-induced
      damage.

TI  - CT perfusion with increased temporal sampling interval to predict target mismatch
      status in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
LID - 10.1007/s00234-022-03026-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of using CT perfusion (CTP) with increased
      temporal sampling interval to predict the target mismatch status in acute
      ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with anterior circular large-vessel occlusion
      (LVO). METHODS: CTP with a sampling interval of 1.7 s (CTP1.7 s) was scanned in
      77 AIS patients for pre-treatment evaluation. Simulated CTP data with sampling
      interval of 3.4 s (CTP3.4 s) or 5.1 s (CTP5.1 s) were reconstructed,
      respectively. Target mismatch was defined according to the EXTEND-IA (Extending
      the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological Deficits-Intra-Arterial) and 
      DEFUSE 3 (Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation for Ischemic Stroke) 
      trial criteria, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, 
      Bland-Altman analysis, and chi-square test were used for statistical analysis as 
      appropriate. RESULTS: Significant correlations were found on the volume of
      ischemic core, hypo-perfused area, mismatch area, and ratio between CTP1.7 s and 
      CTP3.4 s or CTP5.1 s (all p < 0.001). There was no significant difference on the 
      volume of ischemic core, hypo-perfused area, mismatch area, and mismatch ratio
      between CTP1.7 s and CTP3.4 s or CTP5.1 s (all p > 0.05). Compared with CTP1.7 s,
      CTP3.4 s or CTP5.1 s showed comparable performance in predicting the target
      mismatch status in the AIS patients with LVO (both p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CTPs
      with increased temporal sampling intervals that lead to reduced radiation doses
      are feasible and may provide comparable performance in predicting target mismatch
      status in AIS patients with LVO.

TI  - Research interests, experience, and training of Community Health Workers: a mixed
      Method Approach.
LID - 10.1007/s10900-022-01122-3 [doi]
AB  - The Affordable Care Act includes a call for community health care workers (CHWs) 
      to be integrated into health care delivery systems to improve health care
      quality. In recent years, there have been increasing calls for community-based
      participatory research (CBPR) and patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR), as
      such types of research hold much potential for identifying interventions to
      reduce health and health care disparities. Yet, little is known about the
      research training, knowledge, experience, and even interest of CHWs in these
      types of research or in health research in general (HR). Thus, the purposes of
      this study include determining if there are differences between participating
      CHWs (N = 202) in their levels of training, knowledge, experience, and interest
      in relation to CBPR, PCOR and HR. Findings suggest that certified CHWs, as
      compared to non-certified CHWs, have significantly higher knowledge levels across
      all three types of research (beta = 1.3, p = .007). Additionally, participants
      had significantly higher knowledge of HR compared to CBPR (beta = 0.5, p = .015),
      but not higher than their knowledge of PCOR (p > .5). Qualitative data analyses
      performed to determine research areas of interest among the participating CHWs
      resulted in eighteen major research interest themes. Examples of these major
      themes are chronic illness (n = 95), health promotion (n = 39), healthcare
      services and administration (n = 30), mental health (n = 29), and research
      evaluation and methodology (n = 26). Together, the findings suggest that though
      CHWs have an interest in a wide range of health research areas, they could
      benefit from research trainings tailored to their responsibilities and interests.

TI  - Prediction of acute postoperative pain based on intraoperative nociception level 
      (NOL) index values: the impact of machine learning-based analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s10877-022-00897-z [doi]
AB  - The relationship between intraoperative nociception and acute postoperative pain 
      is still not well established. The nociception level (NOL) Index (Medasense,
      Ramat Gan, Israel) uses a multiparametric approach to provide a 0-100 nociception
      score. The objective of the ancillary analysis of the NOLGYN study was to
      evaluate the ability of a machine-learning aglorithm to predict moderate to
      severe acute postoperative pain based on intraoperative NOL values. Our study
      uses the data from the NOLGYN study, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated
      the impact of NOL-guided intraoperative administration of fentanyl on overall
      fentanyl consumption compared to standard of care. Seventy patients (ASA class
      I-III, aged 18-75 years) scheduled for gynecological laparoscopic surgery were
      enrolled. Variables included baseline demographics, NOL reaction to incision or
      intubation, median NOL during surgery, NOL time-weighted average (TWA) above or
      under manufacturers' recommended thresholds (10-25), and percentage of surgical
      time spent with NOL > 25 or < 10. We evaluated different machine learning
      algorithms to predict postoperative pain. Performance was assessed using
      cross-validated area under the ROC curve (CV-AUC). Of the 66 patients analyzed,
      42 (63.6%) experienced moderate to severe pain. NOL post-intubation (42.8
      (31.8-50.6) vs. 34.8 (25.6-41.3), p = 0.05), median NOL during surgery (13
      (11-15) vs. 11 (8-13), p = 0.027), percentage of surgical time spent with NOL >
      25 (23% (18-18) vs. 20% (15-24), p = 0.036), NOL TWA < 10 (2.54 (2.1-3.0) vs.
      2.86 (2.48-3.62), p = 0.044) and percentage of surgical time spent with NOL < 10 
      (41% (36-47) vs. 47% (40-55), p = 0.022) were associated with moderate to severe 
      PACU pain. Corresponding ROC AUC for the prediction of moderate to severe PACU
      pain were 0.65 [0.51-0.79], 0.66 [0.52-0.81], 0.66 [0.52-0.79], 0.65 [0.51-0.79] 
      and 0.67 [0.53-0.81]. Penalized logistic regression achieved the best performance
      with a 0.753 (0.718-0.788) CV-AUC. Our results, even if limited by the small
      number of patients, suggest that acute postoperative pain is better predicted by 
      a multivariate machine-learning algorithm rather than individual intraoperative
      nociception variables. Further larger multicentric trials are highly recommended 
      to better understand the relationship between intraoperative nociception and
      acute postoperative pain.Trial registration Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov in
      October 2018 (NCT03776838).

TI  - Improving acute peritoneal dialysis outcome with use of soft peritoneal dialysis 
      catheter (Cook Mac-Loc Multipurpose Drainage catheter(R)) among infants < 1500 g 
      in a low resource setting.
LID - 10.1007/s00467-022-05700-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite its utility, uncertainty exists on the feasibility of acute
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) and optimal PD catheter type for very low birth weight
      (VLBW < 1500 g) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW < 1000 g) infants. We hereby
      report our experience of acute PD among these high-risk infants and compare the
      outcome between stylet-based rigid catheter (SRC) and Cook Mac-Loc Multipurpose
      Drainage catheters(R) (CMMDC). METHODS: Case notes of infants < 1500 g undergoing
      PD between 2012 and 2021 in a network of five participating neonatal units
      supported by a tertiary paediatric nephrology centre in Kolkata, India, were
      retrospectively reviewed. PD was conducted either with SRC or after 2018 with
      CMMDC. Outcome parameters included complications, survival during PD, and
      survival to discharge. RESULTS: 24 infants (VLBW: n = 13 and ELBW: n = 11)
      underwent PD at median age 4.5 days (IQR 3-6) with either CMMDC (n = 14) or SRC
      (n = 10). Significant improvement in biochemical parameters and fluid removal was
      seen in both ELBW and VLBW infants. CMMDC was associated with significantly fewer
      PD-related complications 7/14 (50%) vs. 9/10 (90%) (p = 0.04) and higher survival
      during PD 13/14 (93%) vs. 5/10 (50%) (p = 0.02), without significant difference
      in survival to hospital discharge 8/14 (57%) vs. 3/10 (30%) (p = 0.25). CMMDC
      also enabled longer duration of PD, higher ultrafiltration, and better control of
      acidosis. Consumable cost was higher for CMMDC (USD$60) than SRC (USD$14).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a low resource setting, CMMDC had lower PD complications and
      superior short-term survival among ELBW/VLBW infants. A higher resolution version
      of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information.

TI  - Activation of necroptosis pathway in podocyte contributes to the pathogenesis of 
      focal segmental glomerular sclerosis.
LID - 10.1007/s10157-022-02258-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is characterized by
      podocyte damage and severe proteinuria. The exact mechanism of podocyte damage
      and loss remains unclear. Necroptosis, a lytic form of programmed cell death
      mediated by RIP3 and MLKL, has emerged as an important cell death pattern in
      multiple tissues and cell types. Necroptosis in FSGS has not been investigated.
      METHODS: Public GEO data regarding podocyte treated with vehicle or adriamycin
      (ADR) was identified and analyzed. Cultured human podocytes were used to explore 
      the activation of necroptosis upon ADR stimulation. The expression of necroptosis
      pathway molecules, p-RIP3 and p-MLKL, was examined in the glomeruli and
      defoliated urinary podocytes of patients with FSGS. The effect of necroptosis
      inhibition was assessed in ADR-induced glomerulopathy mice using GSK872. RESULTS:
      Publicly available RNA-sequencing data analysis showed that both necroptosis and 
      NLRP3 inflammasome pathway were up-regulated in ADR-injured podocyte.
      Immunofluorescent staining showed increased expression of p-RIP3 and p-MLKL, the 
      active forms of RIP3 and MLKL, in podocytes of FSGS patients and ADR-induced
      glomerulopathy mice but not in the normal control. GSK872, an RIP3 kinase
      inhibitor, significantly inhibited the expression of p-RIP3, p-MLKL and
      activation of NLRP3 in cultured podocytes treated with ADR. GSK872 treatment of
      mice with ADR-induced nephropathy resulted in the reduced expression of p-RIP3,
      p-MLKL, NLRP3 and caspase-1 p20. GSK872 also significantly inhibited the
      expression of p-MLKL in the podocytes of ADR-induced nephropathy, resulting in
      the attenuation of proteinuria and renal histological lesions. CONCLUSION:
      Necroptosis pathway might be a valuable target for the treatment of FSGS.

TI  - Reactivation of Bone Lining Cells are Attenuated Over Repeated Anti-sclerostin
      Antibody Administration.
LID - 10.1007/s00223-022-01013-8 [doi]
AB  - Reactivation of bone lining cells (BLCs) is a crucial mechanism governing the
      anabolic action of anti-sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) via modeling-based bone
      formation; however, it remains unclear whether this reactivation can be
      attenuated after persistent administration of Scl-Ab. Here, we aimed to
      investigate the reproducibility of persistent Scl-Ab administration for the
      reactivation of BLCs, and to elucidate the relationship between the activity of
      BLCs and serum levels of N-terminal procollagen type I (P1NP) during chronic
      Scl-Ab administration. We conducted an osteoblast lineage tracing study. Briefly,
      Dmp1-CreERt2(+):Rosa26R mice were injected with 1 mg of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen
      weekly from postnatal weeks four to eight. Mice were treated twice with either
      vehicle or Scl-Ab (25 mg/kg) at weeks 12, 16, and 20, and were euthanized at
      weeks 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, and 21 (4-6 mice in each group). After
      euthanization, the number and thickness of X-gal (+) cells on the periosteum of
      the femoral bones and the serum levels of P1NP were quantified at each time
      point. Scl-Ab induced a significant increase in the thickness of X-gal (+) cells 
      on periosteal bone surfaces at postnatal weeks 13 (after 1st dose), 17 (after 2nd
      dose), and 21 (after 3rd dose) compared to that in vehicle-treated mice (all P < 
      0.001). In the Scl-Ab group, significant increases in the thickness of labeled
      cells were observed between weeks 16 and 17 and weeks 20 and 21 (both P < 0.001).
      The percentage increase in X-gal (+) cell thickness was 108.9% from week 12 to
      week 13, 54.6% from week 16 to week 17, and 49.2% from week 20 to week 21 in the 
      Scl-Ab group. Although Scl-Ab treatment increased the serum levels of P1NP at
      postnatal weeks 13 and 17 compared with those at week 12 (P = 0.017 and P =
      0.038, respectively), the same was not observed at week 21 (P = 0.296). A
      significant increase in P1NP levels was observed between weeks 16 and 17 and
      weeks 20 and 21 in the Scl-Ab group (P = 0.005 and P = 0.007, respectively). The 
      percentage increase in P1NP levels was 141.7% from weeks 12 to 13, 114.8% from
      weeks 16 to 17, and 99.4% from weeks 20 to 21. Serum P1NP levels were positively 
      correlated with X-gal (+) cell thickness (R(2) = 0.732, P < 0.001). Reactivation 
      of BLCs is modestly attenuated, but reproducible, during persistent Scl-Ab
      administration. Serum P1NP levels appear to be an indicator of the impact of
      Scl-Ab on the conversion of BLCs into mature osteoblasts on periosteal bone
      surfaces, thus contributing to modeling-based bone formation.

TI  - Effects of protease inhibitors on dentin erosion: an in situ study.
LID - 10.1007/s00784-022-04657-w [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This in situ study aimed to evaluate the effects of the inhibitors of 
      matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cysteine cathepsins on dentin erosion.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten volunteers participated in this study. Each volunteer 
      wore an intraoral appliance containing 4 dentin specimens subjected to different 
      treatments: deionized water as a control, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline (an MMP
      inhibitor), 50 microM E-64 (a cysteine cathepsin inhibitor), and 1 mM
      1,10-phenanthroline + 50 microM E-64. The specimens were dipped in 5 ml of the
      respective solutions for 30 min at room temperature and then exposed to in vivo
      erosive challenges by rinsing with 150 ml of a cola drink (4 x 5 min/day) for 7
      days. The substance loss of the specimens was measured by profilometry. The
      transverse sections of the specimens were examined using scanning electron
      microscopy. Thereafter, the demineralized organic matrix (DOM) of the specimens
      was removed using type I collagen enzyme and assessed by performing profilometry.
      The differences in substance loss and DOM thickness among the groups were
      analyzed by one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
      Bonferroni's test at a level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: Protease inhibitors
      significantly reduced substance loss in comparison to that of the control group
      (all P < 0.05). A significantly thicker DOM was observed for the specimens
      treated with protease inhibitors than for the control specimens (all P < 0.05).
      No significant differences in substance loss or DOM thickness were found among
      the MMP inhibitor, cysteine cathepsin inhibitor, and MMP + cysteine cathepsin
      inhibitor groups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of MMP and cysteine cathepsin inhibitors
      was shown to increase the acid resistance of human dentin, which may be due to
      the preservation of the DOM. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The application of protease
      inhibitors could be considered an appropriate preventive strategy for dentin
      erosion.

TI  - Facial canal dehiscence, dural exposure, and labyrinthine fistula in middle ear
      cholesteatoma and mastoiditis.
LID - 10.1007/s00405-022-07579-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the prevalence and associations of facial canal dehiscence
      (FCD), dural exposure, and labyrinthine fistula in chronic otitis media (COM)
      with and without cholesteatoma. METHODS: This was a retrospective study performed
      in an academic medical center. Patients who received tympanoplasty with
      mastoidectomy for COM with and without cholesteatoma were included. The
      prevalence of FCD, dural exposure, and labyrinthine fistula in COM with and
      without cholesteatoma (mastoiditis) and their relationships were analyzed.
      RESULTS: A total of 189 patients, including 107 (56.6%) females and 82 (43.4%)
      males, with 191 ears were included. There were 149 cases (78.0%) of cholesteatoma
      and 42 patients (22.0%) with mastoiditis. FCD was noted in 27.5% of patients with
      cholesteatoma and 9.5% of patients with mastoiditis. Dural exposure was found in 
      21 patients (14.1%) with cholesteatoma and 4 patients (9.5%) with mastoiditis.
      Eleven patients (7.4%) with cholesteatoma and 1 patient (2.4%) with mastoiditis
      had labyrinthine fistula. Patients with a labyrinthine fistula had nearly a
      fivefold greater chance (OR = 4.924, 95% CI = 1.355-17.896, p = 0.015) of having 
      FCD than those without a fistula. There was a positive correlation between dural 
      exposure and labyrinthine fistula (P = 0.011, Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSION:
      FCD, dural exposure, and labyrinthine fistula are common complications in COM.
      These complications are more frequently observed in patients with cholesteatoma
      than in patients with mastoiditis. Surgeons should pay more attention to the
      treatment of COM.

TI  - Outcomes of biologic versus synthetic mesh in CDC class 3 and 4 open abdominal
      wall reconstruction.
LID - 10.1007/s00464-022-09486-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR) in a contaminated field is
      associated with an increased risk of wound complications, infection, and
      reoperation. The best method of repair and mesh choice in these operations have
      generated marked controversy. Our aim was to compare outcomes of patients who
      underwent AWR with biologic versus synthetic mesh in CDC class 3 and 4 wounds.
      METHODS: A prospective, single-institution database was queried for AWR using
      biologic or synthetic mesh in CDC Class 3 and 4 wounds. Hernia recurrence and
      complications were measured. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to
      identify factors predicting both. RESULTS: In total, 386 patients with
      contaminated wounds underwent AWR, 335 with biologic and 51 with synthetic mesh. 
      Groups were similar in age, sex, BMI, and rate of diabetes. Biologic mesh
      patients had larger hernia defects (298 +/- 233cm(2) vs. 208 +/- 155cm(2); p =
      0.004) and a higher rate of recurrent hernias (72.2% vs 47.1%; p < 0.001),
      comorbidities(5.8 +/- 2.7 vs. 4.2 +/- 2.4, p < 0.01), and a nearly fivefold
      increase in Class 4 wounds (47.8% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.001), while fascial closure
      trended to being less common (90.7% vs 96.1%; p = 0.078). Hernia recurrence was
      comparable between biologic and synthetic mesh (10.4% vs. 17.6%, p = 0.132).
      Wound complication rates were similar (36.1% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.699), but synthetic
      mesh had higher rates of mesh infection (1.2% vs 11.8%; p < 0.001) and
      infection-related resection (0% vs 7.8%, p < 0.001), with 66% of those synthetic 
      mesh infections requiring excision. On logistic regression, wound complications
      (OR 5.96 [CI 1.60-22.17]; p = 0.008) and bridging mesh (OR 13.10 [CI
      2.71-63.42];p = 0.030) predicted of hernia recurrence (p < 0.05), while synthetic
      mesh (OR 18.6 [CI 2.35-260.4] p = 0.012) and wound complications (OR 20.6 [CI
      3.15-417.7] p = 0.008) predicted mesh infection. CONCLUSIONS: Wound complications
      in AWR with CDC class 3 and 4 wounds significantly increased mesh infection and
      hernia recurrence; failure to achieve fascial closure also increased hernia
      recurrence. Use of synthetic versus biologic mesh increased the mesh infection
      rate by 18.6 times.

TI  - A score to predict the stroke recurrence of patients with embolic stroke of
      undetermined source.
LID - 10.1007/s00415-022-11277-7 [doi]
AB  - AIM: We aimed to develop a score and validate it in a prospective cohort to
      identify the patients with ESUS at high risk for stroke recurrence. METHODS: We
      assessed the stroke recurrence in ESUS patients of the Third China National
      Stroke Registry. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to
      identify predictors of stroke recurrence in the derivation cohort. Based on the
      coefficient of each covariate of the fitted multivariable model, we generated an 
      integer-based point scoring system. We validated the score in the validation
      cohort assessing its discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: 2415 patients were 
      included: 1611 in the derivation and 804 in the validation sample. We developed a
      scoring system (0-15 points) by assigning 2 points for hypertension, 3 points for
      diabetes mellitus, 4 points for multiple stage infarction, 2 points for watershed
      involved infarction, 1 points for left atrial diameter index (per increasing 2.5 
      mm/m2) and 3 points for without statin at discharge. The rate of stroke
      recurrence was 5.9% per year (95% CI 4.2-7.6%) in patients with low risk(a score 
      of 0-5), 9.4% (7.3-11.5%) in patients with intermediate risk (6-10), and 26.8%
      (16.5-37.1%) in patients with high risk (11-15). The AUC (area under curve of
      receiver operator characteristic curve) of the score in the derivation cohort and
      validation cohort was, respectively, 0.60 (0.55-0.65) and 0.63 (0.56-0.70). The
      score was well calibrated both in the derivation cohort (p = 0.36) and validation
      cohort (p = 0.26) with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. CONCLUSION: The developed score 
      can improve risk stratification after ESUS in secondary care settings.

TI  - Molecular subtyping of gastroesophageal dysplasia heterogeneity according to
      TCGA/ACRG classes.
LID - 10.1007/s00428-022-03392-7 [doi]
AB  - Gastric adenocarcinoma has recently been classified into several subtypes on the 
      basis of molecular profiling, which has been successfully reproduced by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). A series of 73
      gastroesophageal dysplastic lesions (37 gastric dysplasia and 36 Barrett
      dysplasia; 44 low-grade dysplasia and 29 high-grade dysplasia) was investigated
      for mismatch repair proteins, E-cadherin, p53, and EBER status, to reproduce The 
      Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) molecular
      clustering. Overall, the dysplastic lesions were classified as follows: according
      to TCGA classification, EBV, 0/73 (0%), MSI, 6/73 (8.2%), GS, 4/73 (5.5%), CIN,
      63/73 (86.3%); according to ACRG molecular subtyping, MSI, 6/73 (8.2%), MSS/EMT, 
      4/73 (5.5%), MSS/TP53(-), 33/73 (45.2%), MSS/TP53(+), 30/73 (41.1%). A positive
      association was found between MSS/TP53(-) and Barrett dysplasia (p = 0.0004),
      between MSS/TP53(+) and LG dysplasia (p = 0.001) and between MSS/TP53(+) and
      gastric dysplasia (p = 0.0018). Gastroesophageal dysplastic lesions proved to be 
      heterogenous in terms of TCGA/ACRG classes, but with a different distribution
      from that of cancers, with no EBV-positive cases, an increasing presence of
      mismatch repair deficiency from low grade to high grade lesions, and a prevalence
      of p53 aberrations in Barrett dysplasia. The present study further demonstrated
      that gastroesophageal dysplastic lesions may be characterized by alterations in
      predictive/prognostic biomarkers, and this should be considered in routine
      diagnostic.

TI  - Clinical validation of Wave-CAIPI susceptibility-weighted imaging for routine
      brain MRI at 1.5 T.
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-08871-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Wave-CAIPI (Controlled Aliasing in Parallel Imaging) enables dramatic
      reduction in acquisition time of 3D MRI sequences such as 3D
      susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) but has not been clinically evaluated at
      1.5 T. We sought to compare highly accelerated Wave-CAIPI SWI (Wave-SWI) with two
      alternative standard sequences, conventional three-dimensional SWI and
      two-dimensional T2*-weighted Gradient-Echo (T2*w-GRE), in patients undergoing
      routine brain MRI at 1.5 T. METHODS: In this study, 172 patients undergoing 1.5 T
      brain MRI were scanned with a more commonly used susceptibility sequence
      (standard SWI or T2*w-GRE) and a highly accelerated Wave-SWI sequence. Two
      radiologists blinded to the acquisition technique scored each sequence for
      visualization of pathology, motion and signal dropout artifacts, image noise,
      visualization of normal anatomy (vessels and basal ganglia mineralization), and
      overall diagnostic quality. Superiority testing was performed to compare Wave-SWI
      to T2*w-GRE, and non-inferiority testing with 15% margin was performed to compare
      Wave-SWI to standard SWI. RESULTS: Wave-SWI performed superior in terms of
      visualization of pathology, signal dropout artifacts, visualization of normal
      anatomy, and overall image quality when compared to T2*w-GRE (all p < 0.001).
      Wave-SWI was non-inferior to standard SWI for visualization of normal anatomy and
      pathology, signal dropout artifacts, and overall image quality (all p < 0.001).
      Wave-SWI was superior to standard SWI for motion artifact (p < 0.001), while both
      conventional susceptibility sequences were superior to Wave-SWI for image noise
      (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Wave-SWI can be performed in a 1.5 T clinical setting
      with robust performance and preservation of diagnostic quality. KEY POINTS: *
      Wave-SWI accelerated the acquisition of 3D high-resolution susceptibility images 
      in 70% of the acquisition time of the conventional T2*GRE. * Wave-SWI performed
      superior to T2*w-GRE for visualization of pathology, signal dropout artifacts,
      and overall diagnostic image quality. * Wave-SWI was noninferior to standard SWI 
      for visualization of normal anatomy and pathology, signal dropout artifacts, and 
      overall diagnostic image quality.

TI  - Myocardial extracellular volume quantified by cardiac magnetic resonance predicts
      left ventricular aneurysm following acute myocardial infarction.
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-08995-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the correlation between increased
      extracellular matrix estimated by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and left
      ventricular aneurysm after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: A total of 175
      patients from 3 centers with an isolated left anterior descending culprit vessel 
      underwent CMR examinations within 1 week and at a 6-month follow-up. Of these, 92
      were identified to have left ventricular aneurysms (LVAs): 74 with functional
      aneurysm and 18 with anatomical aneurysm. The predictive significance of acute
      extracellular volume (ECV), left gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and other
      characteristics were analyzed using binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS:
      Patients with LVA were more likely to present with left ventricular adverse
      remodeling (LVAR) than those without (p = 0.009). With optimal cutoff values of
      30.90% for LGE and 33% for ECV to discriminate LVA from non-LVA, the area under
      the curve (AUC) by receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was 0.92
      (95% CI: 0.87-0.96; p < 0.001) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96; p < 0.001),
      respectively. ECV was significantly better than LGE at discriminating between
      functional and anatomical LVA (p < 0.001). Both acute LGE and ECV were predictors
      of LVA, with an odds ratio of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.21-1.52, p < 0.001) and 1.23 (95%
      CI: 1.13-1.33, p < 0.001), respectively, by multivariable logistic regression
      analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Acute LGE and ECV of the myocardium provided predictive
      significance for LVA. The discriminative significance of ECV for functional
      versus anatomical LVA was better than the discriminative significance of LGE. KEY
      POINTS: * Patients with LVA were more likely to present with LVAR. * Acute LGE
      and ECV of the myocardium provided the strongest predictive significance for LVA.
      * The discriminative significance of ECV for functional versus anatomical LVA was
      better than that of LGE.

TI  - Whole-body MRI in oncology: can a single anatomic T2 Dixon sequence replace the
      combination of T1 and STIR sequences to detect skeletal metastasis and myeloma?
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-09007-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of a single T2 Dixon sequence to
      the combination T1+STIR as anatomical sequences used for detecting tumoral bone
      marrow lesions in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) examinations. METHODS: Between January 
      2019 and January 2020, seventy-two consecutive patients (55 men, 17 women, median
      age = 66 years) with solid (prostate, breast, neuroendocrine) cancers at high
      risk of metastasis or proven multiple myeloma (MM) prospectively underwent a
      WB-MRI examination including coronal T1, STIR, T2 Dixon and axial
      diffusion-weighted imaging sequences. Two radiologists independently assessed the
      combination of T1+STIR sequences and the fat+water reconstructions from the T2
      Dixon sequence. The reference standard was established by consensus reading of
      WB-MRI and concurrent imaging available at baseline and at 6 months.
      Repeatability and reproducibility of MRI scores (presence and semi-quantitative
      count of lesions), image quality (SNR: signal-to-noise, CNR: contrast-to-noise,
      CRR: contrast-to-reference ratios), and diagnostic characteristics (Se:
      sensitivity, Sp: specificity, Acc: accuracy) were assessed per-skeletal region
      and per-patient. RESULTS: Repeatability and reproducibility were at least good
      regardless of the score, region, and protocol (0.67 </= AC1 </= 0.98). CRR was
      higher on T2 Dixon fat compared to T1 (p < 0.0001) and on T2 Dixon water compared
      to STIR (p = 0.0128). In the per-patient analysis, Acc of the T2 Dixon fat+water 
      was higher than that of T1+STIR for the senior reader (Acc = +0.027 [+0.025;
      +0.029], p < 0.0001) and lower for the junior reader (Acc = -0.029 [-0.031;
      -0.027], p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A single T2 Dixon sequence with fat+water
      reconstructions offers similar reproducibility and diagnostic accuracy as the
      recommended combination of T1+STIR sequences and can be used for skeletal
      screening in oncology, allowing significant time-saving. KEY POINTS: *
      Replacement of the standard anatomic T1 + STIR WB-MRI protocol by a single T2
      Dixon sequence drastically shortens the examination time without loss of
      diagnostic accuracy. * A protocol based on fat + water reconstructions from a
      single T2 Dixon sequence offers similar inter-reader agreement and a higher
      contrast-to-reference ratio for detecting lesions compared to the standard T1 +
      STIR protocol. * Differences in the accuracy between the two protocols are
      marginal (+ 3% in favor of the T2 Dixon with the senior reader; -3% against the
      T2 Dixon with the junior reader).

TI  - Using an Assumed Lung Mass Inaccurately Estimates the Lung Absorbed Dose in
      Patients Undergoing Hepatic (90)Yttrium Radioembolization Therapy.
LID - 10.1007/s00270-022-03197-w [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Currently, the estimated absorbed radiation dose to the lung in (90)Y 
      radioembolization therapy is calculated using an assumed 1 kg lung mass for all
      patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether using a patient-specific 
      lung mass measurement for each patient rather than a generic, assumed 1 kg lung
      mass would change the estimated lung absorbed dose. METHODS: A retrospective
      analysis was performed on 68 patients who had undergone (90)Y radioembolization
      therapy at our institution. Individualized lung volumes were measured manually on
      CT scans for each patient, and these volumes were used to calculate personalized 
      lung masses. The personalized lung masses were used to recalculate the estimated 
      lung absorbed dose from the (90)Y therapy, and this dose was compared to the
      estimated lung absorbed dose calculated using an assumed 1 kg lung mass. RESULTS:
      Patient-specific lung masses were significantly different from the generic 1 kg
      when compared individually for each patient (p < 0.0001). Median individualized
      lung mass was 0.71 (IQR: 0.59, 1.02) kg overall and was significantly different
      from the generic 1 kg lung mass for female patients [0.59 (0.50, 0.68) kg, (p <
      0.0001)] but not for male patients [0.99 (0.71, 1.14) kg, (p = 0.24)]. Median
      estimated lung absorbed dose was 4.48 (2.38, 11.71) Gy using a patient-specific
      lung mass and 3.45 (1.81, 6.68) Gy when assuming a 1 kg lung mass for all
      patients. The estimated lung absorbed dose was significantly different using a
      patient-specific versus generic 1 kg lung mass when comparing the doses
      individually for each patient (p < 0.0001). The difference in the estimated lung 
      absorbed dose between the patient-specific and generic 1 kg lung mass method was 
      significant for female patients as a subgroup but not for male patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: The current method of assuming a 1 kg lung mass for all patients
      inaccurately estimates the lung absorbed dose in (90)Y radioembolization therapy.
      Using patient-specific lung masses resulted in estimated lung absorbed doses that
      were significantly different from those calculated using an assumed 1 kg lung
      mass for all patients. A personalized dosimetry method that includes
      individualized lung masses is necessary and can warrant a (90)Y dose reduction in
      some patients with lung masses smaller than 1 kg. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3,
      Retrospective Study.

TI  - [Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and Ologen(R) implant in comparison to classical
      trabeculectomy].
LID - 10.1007/s00347-022-01686-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trabeculectomy (TE) with mitomycin C (MMC) is considered the gold
      standard in glaucoma surgery. A new modification is the use of an Ologen(R)
      implant (AEON Astron Europe B.V., Leiden, Netherlands) during TE, which was
      analyzed and compared to the standard TE in this retrospective study. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: On 70 eyes Ologen(R) was applied during surgery (group 2), whereas
      98 eyes were operated on without the implant (group 1). Both surgical procedures 
      were compared regarding the efficiency of lowering the intraocular pressure
      (IOP), the number of glaucoma medications, the rate of complications and
      follow-up treatment. Data were collected up to 24 months after surgery. RESULTS: 
      In group 1 the IOP was lowered from 28.0mmHg (95% confidence interval, CI
      26.6-29.4mmHg) to 16.0mmHg (14.0-18.1) after 24 months. In group 2, the pressure 
      dropped from 28.5mmHg (26.8-30.1) to 14.3mmHg (11.7-17.0). The IOP reduction was 
      significant in both groups (p< 0.001), there was no significant difference
      between the groups (p> 0.05). Glaucoma-related follow-up treatments were
      performed more often in group 1 but the difference was not significant.
      CONCLUSION: Both procedures significantly lower the IOP and the number of
      glaucoma medications. For our cases, TE with Ologen(R) and MMC is considered to
      be superior to TE with MMC regarding the lower rates of follow-up treatments as
      it is less time-consuming for the patients and the clinic.

TI  - [Autologous serum eye drops for therapy-resistant epithelial defects of the
      cornea : Impact of underlying disease and simultaneous amniotic transplantation
      in 990 applications].
LID - 10.1007/s00347-022-01677-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of simultaneous
      amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT), status of the cornea (own cornea vs.
      graft) and underlying disease on the success and recurrence rates of autologous
      serum (AS) in therapy-resistant epithelial defects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between
      2007 and 2019, 990 treatments with AS in 703 eyes of 645 patients were
      retrospectively examined. The presence of erosion or ulcer, use of AMT, status of
      the cornea and the underlying disease were recorded. Epithelial closure rate
      within 4 weeks and the recurrence rate after epithelial closure were main outcome
      measures. The median observation period was 50 months. RESULTS: Epithelial
      closure was seen in 73.6% and recurrence in 27.4%. AMT was used significantly
      more often for ulcers (p< 0.001) and recurrences (p= 0.048). Without AMT, there
      was a significantly higher epithelial closure rate (p< 0.001) and faster healing 
      tendency (p< 0.001). There was no difference between own corneas and grafts with 
      respect to epithelial closure rate (p= 0.47). On the grafts there was a
      significantly higher recurrence rate (p= 0.004) and faster recurrence (p= 0.03), 
      especially </=6 months after epithelial closure. The underlying diseases showed a
      significant difference in epithelial closure rate (p= 0.02) and recurrence rate
      (p< 0.001) with highest success in corneal dystrophies and lowest in congenital
      aniridia. CONCLUSION: AS is an effective therapeutic option for therapy-resistant
      epithelial defects. There was a high success rate for the grafts but with a
      higher tendency to develop recurrences. In cases of simultaneous AMT, a reduced
      success rate can be expected, due to the higher complexity of the given
      situation. AS can be used successfully in various underlying diseases, with
      limitations in case of congenital aniridia.

TI  - [Immune reaction after penetrating keratoplasty depending on graft size and
      centration].
LID - 10.1007/s00347-022-01672-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune reaction (IR) after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) is a
      serious complication with a high risk of graft failure. The aim of this study was
      to analyze and evaluate the risk factors for IR, in particular, the influence of 
      graft size and centration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 2133 patients who
      underwent PKP between January 2009 and July 2019 were included in this
      retrospective study. The following endpoints were analyzed: frequency of IR,
      graft origin, donor and patient age, diagnosis, corneal diameter and ratio of the
      graft size to the recipient cornea size. In addition, the role of graft
      centration, with the help of distance measurements of the graft margins to the
      vascularized limbus at four locations, was investigated in detail. RESULTS:
      Overall, 8.25% of patients suffered from IR during the observational period. The 
      frequency of IR was significantly correlated (p< 0.001) with the ratio of the
      graft size to the recipient cornea size. In addition, a statistically significant
      correlation was found between the occurrence of IR and a small distance to the
      limbal margins in the Yaxis (inferior and superior). In particular, the
      correlation coefficient was larger at the inferior limbus (p< 0.001). CONCLUSION:
      An IR after PKP is a not uncommon complication and is significantly related to
      graft size and centration. A large graft chosen in relation to the recipient
      cornea and the proximity of the graft to the vascularized limbus at the inferior 
      and superior sites significantly correlate with the occurrence of IR. These are
      important risk factors for graft survival, which can be influenced by the corneal
      microsurgeon and could possibly be further optimized in the future.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy between sequential therapy with teriparatide and
      denosumab and denosumab monotherapy in suppressing fragility fracture risk.
LID - 10.1007/s00198-022-06495-8 [doi]
AB  - In this retrospective study, the effectiveness of short-term teriparatide with
      denosumab in reducing fragility fracture risk was determined in comparison with
      denosumab monotherapy. Administration of sequential teriparatide with denosumab
      showed excellent outcomes in suppressing the risk for fragility fractures
      compared with denosumab monotherapy. INTRODUCTION: To determine the effectiveness
      of short-term teriparatide with denosumab in reducing the risk of fragility
      fractures in comparison to denosumab monotherapy. METHODS: The data of
      postmenopausal patients treated with denosumab for > 2 years between August 2015 
      and October 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. One hundred sixty four
      postmenopausal women of a total 615 were excluded, since they did not undergo > 2
      bone mineral density (BMD) tests, were lost to follow-up, or received long-term
      teriparatide therapy. Total 320 patients received denosumab monotherapy and 131
      patients received teriparatide for >/= 3 months followed by denosumab. The number
      of osteoporotic fractures, presence of back pain before and after treatment, and 
      annual BMD during treatment were comparatively assessed using t-test, Chi-square 
      test, and linear mixed model analysis. RESULTS: Before treatment, the denosumab
      monotherapy group had fewer osteoporotic fractures (mean +/- standard deviation; 
      0.459 +/- 0.689) than the sequential therapy group had (1.037 +/- 0.871; p <
      0.001). After treatment, the sequential therapy group had fewer osteoporotic
      fractures than the denosumab monotherapy group had (0.119 +/- 0.348 versus 0.144 
      +/- 0.385; p < 0.001). At 1 and 2 years after treatment, the increase in lumbar
      spine BMD was greater in the sequential therapy group than in the denosumab
      monotherapy group (p = 0.08, group x time). The difference between post and
      pre-treatment back pain visual analog scale score was significantly lower in the 
      sequential therapy group than in the monotherapy group (3.246 +/- 3.426 versus
      1.734 +/- 3.049; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Short-term teriparatide use before
      denosumab showed excellent outcomes in suppressing the risk of fragility
      fractures compared with denosumab monotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In view of continued development of new oncological approaches, there
      is a high demand for personalized tumor therapy. However, fast and effective
      functional platforms for the prediction of individual patient response to drug
      therapy are largely unavailable. Various promising approaches have already been
      described for three-dimensional cell culture models, which represent cellular
      complexity and almost identical structures of the original tumor tissue.
      OBJECTIVES: Based on a case report, we show the capability and results of a novel
      test system using patient-derived microtumors (PDMs) and autologous
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for the prediction of response to cancer
      therapy. METHODS: We established PDMs and TILs from primary tumor tissue of a
      renal cell carcinoma metastasis. Using immunohistochemistry and multiplex
      florescence-activated cell sorting (FACS ) analyses, the PDMs and TILs were
      characterized regarding to histology and immunophenotype. Tumor-specific
      cytotoxicity of standard of care and investigational compounds were assessed. The
      results were compared to the patient's individual in vivo response to therapy.
      CONCLUSION: The cytotoxicity assay of PDMs and TILs showed a significant
      therapeutic response (p= 0.0004) to therapy with a programmed cell death protein 
      1 (PD-1) inhibitor and lenvatinib compared to the control. The in vitro results
      correlated positively with the in vivo data. In the future, patient-derived
      models could predict response to cancer therapy and may help to optimize
      treatment decision-making.

TI  - The effect of oral medications on fMRI brain activation: A randomized, double
      blind, controlled pilot trial of older women with overactive bladder.
LID - 10.1007/s00192-022-05300-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Observational studies have associated oral anticholinergic 
      medications for overactive bladder (OAB) with cognitive impairment. This is the
      first pilot trial to compare the effects of two classes of OAB medications on
      brain activity in women. We evaluated the effect of anticholinergic versus
      non-anticholinergic (Non-Ach) interventions on regional brain activation during a
      cognitive task. METHODS: Twelve cognitively normal women seeking OAB therapy were
      recruited to a randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled pilot trial.
      Whole-brain regional activity at baseline and 29 +/- 1 days postintervention was 
      assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a working memory task.
      Average activation strength by region was compared after anticholinergic, beta-3 
      agonist, or placebo. Two-way ANOVA compared effects of group and time on average 
      activation strength in anticholinergic versus Non-Ach (beta-3 agonists or
      placebo) groups. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age and body mass index of 12 women were 
      61 (7) years and 36 (7) kg/m(2). Baseline depression and learning scores differed
      in the anticholinergic group (n = 3) versus the Non-Ach group (n = 9). Right
      mamillary body activation postintervention was higher after Non-Ach exposure (F
      4.9, p < 0.04). In the full sample of participants at follow-up, there was less
      activation of the right middle frontal gyrus (p = 0.02), superior frontal gyrus
      (p < 0.01), and supramarginal (p < 0.01) gyrus. CONCLUSION: Activation strength
      in brain regions underlying working memory was lower over time, and recognition
      scores improved. A powered trial is needed to adequately evaluate for
      differential effects of OAB oral medications on regional brain activation.

      in human lymphocytes.
LID - 10.1007/s00066-022-01978-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The frequency of acrocentric chromosome associations (ACA) was studied
      to determine the possible dose-response relationship of gamma irradiation in
      human lymphocytes. METHODS: Peripheral blood collected from three healthy donors 
      was irradiated with 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5Gy of gamma
      radiation. Chromosomal preparations were made after 48h of culture as per
      standard guidelines. The experiment was repeated three times, with a different
      donor each time. RESULTS: The ACA frequency in irradiated lymphocytes increased
      with radiation dose. The D-G type of association was most prominent and showed a 
      significant dose-dependent increase in frequency. The dose response of ACA
      frequency to radiation was found to be linear: ACA frequency= 0.2923 (+/-0.0276)+
      0.1846 (+/-0.0307)xD (correlation coefficient r= 0.9442). As expected, dicentric 
      chromosome (DC) frequencies followed the linear quadratic fit model, with DC
      frequency= 0.0015 (+/-0.0013)+ 0.0220 (+/-0.0059)xD+ 0.0215 (+/-0.0018)xD^2
      (correlation coefficient r= 0.9982). A correlation curve was prepared for ACA
      frequency versus DC frequency, resulting in the regression equation y= 1.130x+
      0.4051 (R(2)= 0.7408; p= 0.0014). CONCLUSION: Our results showed an increase in
      ACA frequency in irradiated lymphocytes with an increase in radiation dose; thus,
      ACA may serve as a candidate cytogenetic biomarker for radiation biodosimetry.

TI  - Virtual reality in preoperative preparation of children undergoing general
      anesthesia: a randomized controlled study.
LID - 10.1007/s00101-022-01177-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety can cause hyperalgesia, postoperative delirium
      and other adverse events, and even long-term psychological disorders. The aim of 
      this trial was to determine whether preoperative virtual reality (VR) preparation
      reduces anxiety prior to induction of anesthesia. METHODS: Data were analyzed for
      99 children undergoing elective surgery. Participants were randomly assigned to a
      VR exposure intervention group or a control group. In the VR group, children
      watched a VR video showing a realistic interactive immersive virtual version of
      the perioperative process. The control group received conventional preoperative
      preparation. Preoperative anxiety using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety
      Scale-Short Form (mYPAS-SF) during anesthesia induction was the main outcome.
      Secondary outcomes included induction compliance, emergence delirium, pain, and
      parental satisfaction. RESULTS: The VR group had lower mYPAS-SF scores when
      leaving the waiting area (27.1, interquartile range, IQR 22.9-33.3 vs. 33.3, IQR 
      27.1-39.6; P= 0.006), and during anesthesia induction (29.2, IQR 22.9-33.3 vs.
      39.6, IQR 33.3-55.2; P= 9x10(-6)). The Induction Compliance Checklist (ICC)
      scores during anesthesia induction were lower in the VR group (0.0, IQR 0.0-0.0
      vs. 1.0, IQR 0.0-1.0; P= 0.003) than the control group, while parental
      satisfaction in the VR group was higher. CONCLUSION: Virtual reality exposure as 
      a preparation tool has a beneficial effect on anxiety, induction compliance and
      parental satisfaction in children undergoing elective surgery. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - [Analyses of requirements for curriculum development for the training of
      anesthesiologists in the delivery room-A nationwide survey].
LID - 10.1007/s00101-022-01172-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anesthesiologic activity in the delivery room environment implies the
      specifics of a 200% lethality, which describes that emergency situations can
      affect mother and child. A circumstance that impressively underlines the need for
      special care in employee training and selection. The training situation in the
      delivery room is characterized by several difficulties. Technical procedures are 
      often performed on the awake patient, who is herself in an exciting situation
      during childbirth. A detailed description of the necessary competences in this
      working environment does not exist at the present. The present study aims to
      describe the further education situation in anesthesiology. The results can
      represent the first step of a curriculum development according to the concept of 
      Kern et al. in the sense of a needs assessment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a
      multicenter observational study, doctors in further training (AiW) and
      consultants (FA) were asked about methods of familiarization, feedback,
      activities taken on and the need for a curriculum. The level of supervision and
      confidence in action during procedures was also elicited. Participants were
      contacted via the membership database of the German Society of Anesthesia and
      Intensive Care and could answer the 11-item questionnaire online. RESULTS: A
      total of 495 questionnaires (329 FA; 166 AiW;) were completed. The FA and AiW
      gave different information on the conduct of exit interviews (59.6% vs. 10%) and 
      curriculum support (76.3% vs.17.5%). Independent of the year of training, AiWs
      perform cesarean sections under on-demand (reactive) supervision. Peridural
      anesthesia (PDA) is the least frequently performed procedure in the context of
      the familiarization situation with obstetric anesthesia. The groups have a
      different confidence of security in the successful implementation of procedures, 
      when AiW are proceeding without direct supervision (FA= MD 61; AiW= MD 77; p<
      0.001; scale 0= unsecure-100= very secure). Practical and technical support is
      mostly provided immediately by FA (>MW 91; scale 0= never-100= immediately).
      Individual values deviate significantly from the average values (outliers). Both 
      groups rate the usefulness or value of describing learning objectives and the
      availability of a curriculum as high. DISCUSSION: The support of familiarization 
      and continuing support is partly answered differently by consultants and doctors 
      in further training. Individual procedures that are rarely performed, such as
      administration of a PDA, require special attention in the future. Curricula with 
      workplace-based assessments could provide feedback and assurance to increase
      confidence in the successful implementation of procedures by AiW. The AiW usually
      receive immediate professional support. Individual institutions do not seem to
      have any concepts here and must rethink their processes. This fact is
      particularly important against the background of the medicolegal significance of 
      the subject. The description of learning objectives and curriculum development is
      desired both by FA and AiW.

TI  - [Does NoL monitoring affect opioid consumption during da Vinci prostatectomy?]
LID - 10.1007/s00101-022-01126-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Administration of opioids to suppress pain plays a major role in
      modern anesthesia. Measuring depth of hypnosis and neuromuscular recovery are
      already well established, and devices for pain monitoring are available.
      Nonetheless pain monitoring is rare in clinical practice. Recently, the pain
      monitoring device PMD200 (Medasense Biometrics , Israel) was introduced. It
      non-invasively measures heart rate, heart rate variability, skin resistance,
      resistance variability, temperature and movement to calculate a nociception level
      (NoL) index. The NoL index range starts at zero, which is equivalent to being
      painless, and goes up to a value of 100. The validity and reliability of NoL
      monitoring is the content of current studies. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis
      if the use of the PMD200 significantly reduces opioid consumption during da Vinci
      prostatectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 50 male patients were included in
      this randomized, single blinded study. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia because
      the pain monitoring device requires a sinus rhythm for reliable results. Patients
      received a weight-adjusted sufentanil bolus (0.3microg/kg ideal body weight)
      during induction of anesthesia. Additionally, they received 10microg of
      sufentanil before skin incision. Both groups received total intravenous
      anesthesia with propofol and continuous muscle relaxation through cis-atracurium.
      In the control group (CONT; n= 26), a standardized sufentanil bolus of 10microg
      were administered by common criteria (heart rate/blood pressure increase,
      lacrimation, gut feeling) at the anesthesiologist's discretion. In the
      intervention group (INT; n= 24), patients received the standardized sufentanil
      bolus when the NoL index was above 25 for 2min, which corresponds to the
      manufacturer's recommendation. The NoL index and bolus administrations were
      recorded for every patient. In the control group, the display of the pain monitor
      showing the NoL index was not visible for the anesthesiologist. Postoperatively, 
      pain/nausea scores and piritramide consumption were taken every 10min for 1h in
      the recovery room. None of the patients had prior chronic pain with long-term use
      of painkillers. Statistics were done using Mann-Whitney Utest, Kolmogorov-Smirnov
      test and Levene test. RESULTS: Sufentanil bolus administrations, normalized for
      duration of surgery, were not significantly lower in the intervention group (p=
      0.065). We noticed a significant difference in variation of opioid
      administrations (p= 0.033). Sufentanil boluses per hour in the INT were normally 
      distributed (p= 0.2), whereas in CONT they were not (p= 0.003). Postoperative
      data like nausea, opioid consumption and pain scale showed no differences between
      groups. CONCLUSION: The use of PMD200 did not significantly reduce cumulative
      opioid consumption. Following on we must reject the initial hypothesis. The
      difference in sufentanil bolus variances may point to an individualized
      antinociceptive therapy when NoL monitoring is used. We suppose patients with
      high opioid demands are detected and patients with low opioid demands did not
      receive unnecessary opioids. This assumption is only true if the PMD200 measures 
      the entity pain. Further studies with more participants during surgery with
      higher tissue damage could lead to more convincing data and conclusions.

TI  - Major Histotypes in Skin Melanoma: Nodular and Acral Lentiginous Melanomas Are
      Poor Prognostic Factors for Relapse and Survival.
LID - 10.1097/DAD.0000000000002264 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: The histological subtype is not considered one of the major prognostic 
      factors in melanoma, yet it is known to have an impact on survival. The aim of
      this study was to investigate the clinical significance of histological subtypes 
      and the possible impacts of clinicopathological factors on the course of melanoma
      patients of all stages. A total of 1017 cutaneous melanoma patients were analyzed
      retrospectively. Four major melanoma histotypes that were studied in this study
      were as follows: (1) superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), (2) nodular melanoma
      (NM), (3) acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), and (4) lentigo maligna melanoma
      (LMM). Unlike SSMs and LMMs, there were statistically significant correlations
      between NMs and ALMs and most aggressive histopathological prognostic indicators,
      such as higher Clark level (P = 0.0001), thick Breslow depth (P = 0.0001),
      presence of ulceration (P = 0.0001), and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.0001).
      Furthermore, NMs and ALMs were also associated with advanced clinical stages,
      that is, node involvement and metastasis. Relapse rates for nonmetastatic
      melanomas were higher in NMs (39.6%) and ALMs (35.3%) than in SSMs (24.3%) and
      LMMs (10.3%) (P = 0.0001). Additionally, 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 
      90.5%, 70.5%, 55.7%, and 50.5% in LMMs, SSMs, ALMs, and NMs, respectively (P =
      0.0001). Moreover, 5-year overall survival rates plummeted from 84.3% in LMMs to 
      74.8%, 64.3%, and 46% in SSMs, ALMs, and NMs, respectively (P = 0.0001). In
      conclusion, we observed that the histologic subtype was an independent predictor 
      for relapse and outcome for cutaneous melanoma patients. Both NM and ALM had
      unfavorable prognoses, and they were associated with known poor pathological and 
      clinical indicators.

TI  - [Acceptance and status of digitalization in clinics and practices : Current
      assessment in German urology].
LID - 10.1007/s00120-022-01889-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digitalization of patient documentation and introduction of the
      electronic patient record (ePA) pose challenges to everyday clinical practice.
      OBJECTIVES: We investigated the acceptance and status of the digitalization of
      patient data and the introduction of the ePA among German urologists. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: A questionnaire with 30 questions about the acceptance and status of
      digitalization of patient documentation and ePA was sent out via the newsletter
      of the German Society of Urology. RESULTS: A total of 80 urologists participated 
      in the survey (response rate 2%). Digital platforms such as Urotube or
      Researchgate are used by 63% of participants. The complete implementation of
      digital patient documentation was reported by 72% of respondents working in
      medical practice and by 54% of those working in the hospital (p= 0.042). While
      76% see the digitalization process as reasonable, 34% expressed partial or strong
      concerns about the complete digitalization of patient documentation. Only 14% of 
      the participants offer video consultations. Advantages for ePA include better
      networking of the healthcare system (73%), improved diagnosis, indication (41%)
      and treatment quality (48%), and avoidance of medication errors (70%).
      CONCLUSION: German urologists are open to the digitalization process and ePA.
      Especially younger urologists are using digital media. The advantages of
      digitalization are, in particular, an improvement in treatment processes. For a
      smooth introduction, a cross-departmental establishment and, if necessary, an
      adaptation of the treatment processes are necessary.

TI  - [Outpatient before inpatient treatment?-Reality of care and economic analysis for
      minor urological interventions in Germany between 2013 and 2018].
LID - 10.1007/s00120-022-01873-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although outpatient provision of services is economically desirable, 
      many minor urological interventions in Germany are currently carried out on an
      inpatient basis. The aim of our study is to investigate whether the current
      health policy framework contributes to more outpatient treatment. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We used a sample of 4.9 million anonymous, insured persons
      representative according to age and region provided by the Institute for Applied 
      Health Research (InGef GmbH). We report extrapolations for the number of
      outpatient and inpatient services throughout Germany between 2013 and 2018. In
      addition, we performed an economic analysis for two selected interventions.
      RESULTS: During the study period, the total number of prostate biopsies declined 
      from 184,573 to 174,558 cases. The share of outpatient biopsies declined
      continuously by 0.9% per year from 81% to 76% (p< 0.001). For botulinum toxin
      injection into the bladder, the total increased from 15,630 to 26,824 cases. The 
      share of outpatient treatments increased by 2.7% per year from 3% to 19% (p=
      0.01). For the other examined interventions (insertion of suprapubic urinary
      catheters, the insertion, removal, and changing of ureteral stents, cystoscopies 
      and urethral dilatation), there were no significant changes in the share of
      outpatient procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The significant increase of outpatient
      botulinum toxin injections shows the successful control effect through adapted
      remuneration options. A shift to the inpatient sector was observed for prostate
      biopsies. This may be due to higher hygienic standards and technical requirements
      for MRI fusion.

TI  - [Quality assurance for the treatment of muscle-invasive and metastasized bladder 
      carcinoma in Germany : An initiative of the Working Groups Urological Oncology
      (AUO) and Internal Oncology (AIO) in the German Cancer Society (DKG)].
LID - 10.1007/s00120-022-01870-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The S3-guideline on bladder cancer recommends radical cystectomy and 
      cisplatin-based perioperative chemotherapy (POC) for muscle-invasive bladder
      cancer (MIBC). Recommendation for metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) is
      cisplatin-based or immuno-oncological (IO) treatment in platinum-ineligible
      patients (pts) or as 2nd-line therapy. OBJECTIVES: Aim of the study was to obtain
      representative data on clinical routine treatment of MIBC and mUC in Germany.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nationwide survey was performed to obtain data on
      stage-related patient volume in hospitals and office-based physicians. Based on
      these results, a representative sample of treatment data was collected
      retrospectively from pts with MIBC and mUC. RESULTS: Data from 956 pts (MIBC 576;
      mUC: 380) were collected. Of the MIBC pts, 49.8% received a systemic therapy
      (80.4% of them received cisplatin/gemcitabine) and 50.2% were treated with a
      cystectomy without POC. Significant factors for cystectomy without POC were
      higher age >75 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      3.01-8.11, p< 0.001) and platinum-ineligible pts (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.30-3.59; p=
      0.003). Treatment decision without interdisciplinary tumor board was also
      correlated with no POC (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.65-3.61, p< 0.001). In mUC
      platinum-pretreated pts generally receive IO therapy (OR 12.07, 95% CI
      6.94-21.82, p< 0.001). Other significant factors are positive PD-L1 status (OR
      3.72, 95% CI 1.30-5.71, p< 0.001), higher age >75 years (OR 2.83, 95% CI
      1.43-5.73, p= 0.003) and platinum-ineligible pts (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.30-5.71, p=
      0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The "gold standard" cisplatin/gemcitabine is established in 
      Germany if pts are treated with POC. Nonetheless half of the MIBC pts did not
      receive a POC, especially if the treatment decision is not discussed in a tumor
      board. In mUC IO therapy is established as 2nd-line therapy after a
      platinum-based treatment. Although the guideline recommendations are largely
      implemented, there is potential for optimization, especially in the establishment
      of interdisciplinary tumor boards.

TI  - [First data from a digital health app for erectile dysfunction].
LID - 10.1007/s00120-022-01872-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In a systematic data analysis, we evaluated the influence of a digital
      health app on erection scores as well as life quality and patient activation in a
      group of patients with erectile dysfunction. METHODS: In all, 44 participants
      took part in an evidence-based program for patients with erectile dysfunction.
      The in app 12-week program included pelvic floor exercises and physiotherapeutic 
      and cardiovascular training. In addition, there where sessions on mindfulness and
      sexual therapy as well as useful information about erectile dysfunction and its
      causes, nutrition, and risk factors. The median age was 46 years (19-75 years).
      All patients answered IIEF5, PAM-13 and QoL-Med questionnaires at the beginning
      and the end of the program. A total of 27 questionnaires could be evaluated at
      both times. RESULTS: The average improvement in IIEF5 score was 4.5 points (p<
      0.0001). 96% of patients showed overall improvement of erection scores.
      Improvement in life quality was shown in 93% of participants. Moreover, there was
      a significant increase in patient activation scores. CONCLUSION: We were able to 
      show that a multimodal digital app for self-management of erectile dysfunction
      improved not only erection scores but also life quality and patient activation.
      We concluded that it is possible to reproduce results of analog studies in a
      digital setting. Digital solutions can help to include patients in their
      treatment and to put guideline suggestions into practice.

      Setting.
LID - fmac057 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/tropej/fmac057 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drowning is a public health problem that is under-reported in
      Africa. We sought to evaluate the epidemiology and risk factors for drownings in 
      Malawi. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all pediatric (</=15
      years old) patients who presented following a drowning incident to Kamuzu Central
      Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi, from 2009-19. Demographics and outcomes were
      compared between survivors and non-survivors. Logistic multivariate regression
      analysis was used to identify factors associated with increased odds of
      mortality. RESULTS: There were 156 pediatric drowning victims during the study
      period. The median age at presentation was 3 (IQR: 2-7 years). Survivors were
      younger [median age: 2 years (IQR: 2-5) vs. 5 years (IQR: 2-10), p = 0.004], with
      a higher proportion of drownings occurring at home (85.6% vs. 58.3%, p = 0.001)
      compared to non-survivors. Patients who had a drowning event at a public space
      had increased odds of mortality (OR 8.17, 95% CI 2.34-28.6). Patients who were
      transferred (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.003-0.25) and had other injuries (OR 0.20, 95% CI 
      0.06-0.70) had decreased odds of mortality following drowning. CONCLUSION: Over
      half of pediatric drowning victims at a tertiary-care facility in Malawi
      survived. Drowning survivors were significantly younger, more likely to have
      drowned at home, and transported by private vehicles and minibus than
      non-survivors. There is a need for scalable, cost-effective drowning prevention
      strategies that focus on water safety education and training community members
      and police officers in basic life support and resuscitation.

TI  - What are the long-term patient-reported and clinical outcomes after lateral
      clavicle fractures? A cross-sectional study of 619 patients.
LID - 10.1007/s00068-022-02062-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lateral clavicle fractures account for 17% of all clavicle fractures 
      and large studies comparing nonoperative and operative treatment are lacking.
      Therefore, patients cannot be properly informed about different treatment options
      and prognosis. We assessed long-term patient-reported and clinical outcomes in
      patients with lateral clavicle fractures. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional 
      study was performed in patients treated for lateral clavicle fractures between
      2007 and 2016. Primary outcome included patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)
      (DASH, EQ-5D, return to work, sports, cosmetics and satisfaction). Questionnaires
      were sent to 619 eligible patients, of which 353 (57%) responded after a mean
      follow-up of 7.4 +/- 2.8 years. Secondary outcome included adverse events and
      secondary interventions. Outcomes after nonoperative vs. operative treatment
      (stratified by nondisplaced vs. displaced fractures) were compared using Student 
      t tests and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Nondisplaced lateral clavicle
      fractures were treated nonoperatively and resulted in excellent PROMs. Six
      patients (3%) developed a nonunion. For displaced lateral clavicle fractures, no 
      differences were found between nonoperative and operative treatment with regard
      to DASH score (7.8 +/- 12.5 vs 5.4 +/- 8.6), EQ-5D (0.91 +/- 0.13 vs 0.91 +/-
      0.09), pain (0.9 +/- 1.7 vs. 0.8 +/- 1.6), patient satisfaction (90.1 +/- 25.5
      vs. 86.3 +/- 20.4), return to work (96.4% vs. 100%) and sports (61.4% vs. 62.3%).
      The absolute risk of nonunion in patients with a displaced fracture was higher
      after nonoperative than operative treatment (20.2% vs. 2.9%; p = 0.002), with six
      patients needing treatment to avoid one nonunion. CONCLUSIONS: Nondisplaced
      lateral clavicle fractures should be treated nonoperatively and result in good
      functional outcomes and high union rates. For displaced fractures, neither
      nonoperative nor operative treatment seems superior. Patients opting for
      nonoperative treatment should be informed that nonunion occurs in 20% of
      patients, but only half of these need additional operative treatment. Patients
      who opt for surgery should be told that nonunion occurs in only 3%; however, most
      patients (56%) will require secondary intervention for elective implant removal. 
      Regardless of the type of treatment, no differences in functional outcome and
      PROMs should be expected at long-term follow-up.

TI  - The MVBML approach: a management for buccal cancer with wider indications and
      higher satisfaction.
LID - 10.1111/odi.14340 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of MVBML approach 
      on postoperative facial scar, nerves injury and prognosis of patients with BSCC. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single-center, prospective cohort study that
      enrolled 80 patients with BSCC from June 2015 to December 2020. According to the 
      different surgical approaches, the patients were divided into two groups: the
      lower lip median (LLM) approach group and the modified vermilion
      border-marionette line (MVBML) approach group. RESULTS: The results showed that
      the appearance (p=0.003), scar consciousness (p<0.001) and satisfaction with
      appearance (p=0.001) of patients in the MVBML group were significantly better
      than those in the LLM group, and the difference was more obvious in elderly
      group. Statistical analysis of postoperative nerves injury showed that the MVBML 
      group had a lower risk of facial and mental nerves injury than the LLM group, and
      there was a significant statistical difference in mental nerve injury between the
      two groups (p<0.001). Through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we found no
      significant difference in disease-specific survival (p=0.47) or disease-free
      survival (p=0.70) between the LLM approach group and the MVBML approach group.
      CONCLUSIONS: The MVBML surgical approach is worthy of advancement for the
      surgical treatment of BSCC.

TI  - FDA Approval Summary: Pembrolizumab for Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of
      Patients with High-Risk Early-Stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer.

LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-1110 [doi]
AB  - On July 26, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration granted approval to
      pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy for neoadjuvant treatment and then
      continued as a single agent for adjuvant treatment following surgery for patients
      with high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Approval was
      based on results from KEYNOTE-522, an ongoing randomized (2:1) trial evaluating
      pembrolizumab or placebo in combination with chemotherapy for neoadjuvant
      treatment and then as a single agent for adjuvant treatment. The co-primary
      endpoints were pathological complete response (pCR) rate and event free survival 
      (EFS). The trial demonstrated an improvement in pCR and EFS in the pembrolizumab 
      arm compared to the control arm. The number of patients who experienced an EFS
      event was 123 (16%) and 93 (24%), respectively (HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.48-0.82,
      p=0.00031). Patients on the pembrolizumab arm experienced EFS benefit regardless 
      of tumor PD-L1 status. The absolute pCR rate improvement with the addition of
      pembrolizumab was 7.5% (95% CI: 1.6%, 13.4%). Among patients receiving
      pembrolizumab, 44% experienced an immune-related adverse reaction. This article
      summarizes FDA's review of pembrolizumab and the data supporting the favorable
      benefit-risk assessment.

TI  - Controlling axonal regeneration with acellular nerve allograft limits neuroma
      formation in peripheral nerve transection: An experimental study in a swine
      model.
LID - 10.1002/micr.30943 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatic neuromata are a common indication for revision surgery
      following amputation. Previously described treatments, including traction
      neurectomy, nerve transposition, targeted muscle re-innervation, and nerve
      capping, have provided inconsistent results or are technically challenging. Prior
      research using acellular nerve allografts (ANA) has shown controlled termination 
      of axonal regrowth in long grafts. The purpose of this study was to determine the
      ability of a long ANA to prevent neuroma formation following transection of a
      peripheral nerve in a swine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two adult female
      Yucatan miniature swine (Sus scrofa; 4-6 months, 15-25 kg) were assigned to
      control (ulnar nerve transection only, n = 10), treatment (ulnar transection and 
      coaptation of 50 mm ANA, n = 10), or donor (n = 2) groups. Nerves harvested from 
      donor group animals were treated to create the ANA. After 20 weeks, the
      transected nerves including any neuroma or graft were harvested. Both qualitative
      (nerve architecture, axonal sprouting) and quantitative histologic analyses
      (myelinated axon number, cross sectional area of nerve tissue) were performed.
      RESULTS: Qualitative histologic analysis of control specimens revealed robust
      axon growth into dense scar tissue. In contrast, the treatment group revealed
      dwindling axons in the terminal tissue, consistent with attenuated neuroma
      formation. Quantitative analysis revealed a significantly decreased number of
      myelinated axons in the treatment group (1232 +/- 540) compared to the control
      group (44,380 +/- 7204) (p < .0001). Cross sectional area of nerve tissue was
      significantly smaller in treatment group (2.83 +/- 1.53 mm(2) ) compared to the
      control group (9.14 +/- 1.19 mm(2) ) (p = .0012). CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant axonal
      growth is controlled to termination with coaptation of a 50 mm ANA in a swine
      model of nerve injury. These early results suggest further investigation of this 
      technique to prevent and/or treat neuroma formation.

TI  - Effects of Antipsychotic Medications and Illness Duration on Brain Features That 
      Distinguish Schizophrenia Patients.
LID - sbac094 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbac094 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Previous studies have reported effects of
      antipsychotic treatment and illness duration on brain features. This study used a
      machine learning approach to examine whether these factors in aggregate impacted 
      the utility of MRI features for differentiating individual schizophrenia patients
      from healthy controls. STUDY DESIGN: This case-control study used patients with
      never-treated first-episode schizophrenia (FES, n = 179) and long-term ill
      schizophrenia (LTSZ, n = 30), with follow-up of the FES group after treatment (n 
      = 71), a group of patients who had received long-term antipsychotic treatment (n 
      = 93) and age and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 373) for each patient group. 
      A multiple kernel learning classifier combining both structural and functional
      brain features was used to discriminate individual patients from controls. STUDY 
      RESULTS: MRI features differentiated untreated FES (0.73) and LTSZ (0.83)
      patients from healthy controls with moderate accuracy, but accuracy was
      significantly higher in antipsychotic-treated FES (0.94) and LTSZ (0.98)
      patients. Treatment was associated with significantly increased accuracy of case 
      identification in both early course and long-term ill patients (both p < .001).
      Effects of illness duration, examined separately in treated and untreated
      patients, were less robust. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that initiation 
      of antipsychotic treatment alters brain features in ways that further distinguish
      individual schizophrenia patients from healthy individuals, and have a modest
      effect of illness duration. Intrinsic illness-related brain alterations in
      untreated patients, regardless of illness duration, are not sufficiently robust
      for accurate identification of schizophrenia patients.

TI  - Yearling bulls have reduced sperm concentration and increased seminal plasma
      interleukin-8 after a 28-day breeding season.
LID - 10.1111/rda.14223 [doi]
AB  - We hypothesized that yearling bulls selected for a 28-d breeding season would
      have reduced sperm concentrations, morphology, and have increased seminal plasma 
      concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). Yearling bulls 
      were selected based on a breeding soundness examination at approximately 415-d of
      age and contained at least 750 million sperm in the ejaculate, with 12 bulls
      randomly selected for breeding (BREEDERS) and 12 bulls not selected for breeding 
      (NON-BREEDERS). After a 28-d breeding period, all bulls underwent a breeding
      soundness exam. Plasma and seminal plasma were collected at each time point for
      analysis. Data were analyzed utilizing either the MIXED or GLIMMIX procedures
      with repeated measures in SAS with breeding group, age, and the interaction as
      fixed effects. Sperm concentration per ml of ejaculate was reduced (P<0.05) in
      yearling bulls used for breeding compared with those not used for breeding at the
      end of the breeding season. Seminal plasma IL-8 concentrations in yearling bulls 
      used for breeding were increased (P<0.05) after the breeding season compared to
      bulls not used for breeding. Taken together, yearling bulls selected for a 28-d
      breeding season have reduced sperm production per ml of an ejaculate and
      increased inflammatory response in the seminal plasma that can lead to impaired
      breeding response if they are to be used for more than 30-d of breeding.

TI  - Serum Immunoglobulin E and Vitamin D Levels in Asthma Patients in Enugu, Nigeria:
      Association with Asthma Control.
PG  - 721-728
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma symptoms are often mediated by changes in immune responses to 
      allergens measured by the levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and non-protein
      regulators such as 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25 (OH) vitamin D3). The
      relationship between serum levels of IgE, 25 (OH) Vitamin D3, and asthma control 
      in asthma patients remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To measure the serum IgE and 25
      (OH) vitamin D3 levels in asthma patients and determine their relationship with
      patient's asthma control. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of children
      and adults with asthma aged 5 to 60 years old; and their controls seen in a
      tertiary hospital in Enugu, south eastern Nigeria from October 2018 to January
      2019. Serum levels of IgE, and 25 (OH) vitamin D3 were determined by sandwich
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and compared between groups using the 
      Student's t-tests. Association between IgE, 25 (OH) vitamin D3 levels, and asthma
      control were determined using the Chi-square. RESULTS: Sixty-five (65) asthma
      patients and thirty-three (36) non-asthma controls were studied. Mean serum level
      of IgE (411.32+/- 220.18 IU/ml) was significantly raised in asthma patients
      compared to controls (163.51 +/- 186.36 lU/ml); p=0.001. There was no significant
      difference in mean 25 (OH) vitamin D3 levels in asthma (68.55 +/- 25.91 ng/ml)
      compared to controls (77.25 +/- 34.01 ng/ml); p=0.153. No significant association
      was found between patient's asthma control status, and serum IgE and 25 (OH)
      vitamin D3 levels. CONCLUSION: Asthma control status was not associated with
      Immunoglobulin E and 25 (OH) vitamin D3 levels in those studied. More robust
      study is required to evaluate the relationship between asthma control, IgE and
      vitamin D levels.

TI  - Morphometric Integrated Classification Index: A Multisite Model-Based,
      Interpretable, Shareable and Evolvable Biomarker for Schizophrenia.
LID - sbac096 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbac096 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Multisite massive schizophrenia neuroimaging data
      sharing is becoming critical in understanding the pathophysiological mechanism
      and making an objective diagnosis of schizophrenia; it remains challenging to
      obtain a generalizable and interpretable, shareable, and evolvable neuroimaging
      biomarker for schizophrenia diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: A Morphometric Integrated
      Classification Index (MICI) was proposed as a potential biomarker for
      schizophrenia diagnosis based on structural magnetic resonance imaging data of
      1270 subjects from 10 sites (588 schizophrenia patients and 682 normal controls).
      An optimal XGBoost classifier plus sample-weighted SHapley Additive explanation
      algorithms were used to construct the MICI measure. STUDY RESULTS: The MICI
      measure achieved comparable performance with the sample-weighted ensembling model
      and merged model based on raw data (Delong test, P > 0.82) while outperformed the
      single-site models (Delong test, P < 0.05) in either the independent-sample
      testing datasets from the 9 sites or the independent-site dataset
      (generalizable). Besides, when new sites were embedded in, the performance of
      this measure was gradually increasing (evolvable). Finally, MICI was strongly
      associated with the severity of schizophrenia brain structural abnormality, with 
      the patients' positive and negative symptoms, and with the brain expression
      profiles of schizophrenia risk genes (interpretable). CONCLUSIONS: In summary,
      the proposed MICI biomarker may provide a simple and explainable way to support
      clinicians for objectively diagnosing schizophrenia. Finally, we developed an
      online model share platform to promote biomarker generalization and provide free 
      individual prediction services (http://micc.tmu.edu.cn/mici/index.html).

      Training in Combination with Conventional Rehabilitation on Hand Function in
      Patients with Chronic Stroke.
PG  - jrm00323
LID - 10.2340/jrm.v54.1407 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of exoskeleton robot-assisted passive range of
      motion for induction training in combination with conventional hand
      rehabilitation in patients with chronic stroke. DESIGN: Single-cohort. SUBJECTS: 
      Chronic stroke with severe upper extremity hemiparesis. METHODS: Thirty sessions 
      of therapy over a period of 10 weeks. Each session started with 30 min
      robot-assisted passive range of motion for the hand, followed by 30 min
      conventional hand rehabilitation. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity, 
      arm subscore of Motricity Index, Functional Independence Measure and Fugl-Meyer
      assessment for sensation (Fugl-Meyer assessment-sensory) were conducted at
      pre-intervention (pre) and after the 16th (16-post) and 30th (30-post) sessions
      of interventions. RESULTS: Twelve patients with chronic stroke were recruited.
      The Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremity (16-post vs 30-post, p = 0.011),
      arm subscore of Motricity Index (pre vs 30-post, p = 0.012) and Functional
      Independence Measure (pre vs 30-post, p = 0.007; 16-post vs 30-post, p = 0.016)
      improved significantly after the therapy. However, FMA-sensory did not change
      significantly. CONCLUSION: Exoskeleton robot-assisted passive range of motion of 
      the hand using an exoskeleton can be considered as an induction therapy before
      starting conventional therapy for hand rehabilitation in patients with chronic
      stroke. Further randomized control trials are needed to verify the therapeutic
      benefits.

      haemato-oncologic patients.
LID - 10.1111/odi.14335 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examines associations of active matrix metalloproteinase-8
      (aMMP-8) point-of-care immunotest (Periosafe) outcomes with oral health of
      patients with haemato-oncologic diseases. METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with 
      haematological diseases aimed to be treated with haematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) between 2018 and 2019 were included in the study. Clinical
      and radiological dental examination were taken immediately prior to
      transplantation. Presence of oral foci of infections, caries or periodontitis
      were examined and compared with the outcomes of aMMP-8 immunotest. RESULTS: Acute
      oral infection foci were present in 11.9%, chronic in 44.1% and periodontitis in 
      42.0% of the 143 subjects. aMMP-8 immunotest was positive in 13.3% of all the 143
      subjects. Among subjects with periodontitis (n=60) the aMMP-8 immunotest was also
      positive in 13.3% of these subjects. However, the subjects with positive aMMP-8
      immunotest (n=19) had more often acute or chronic infection foci and more than
      one of the examined dental treatment needs compared to subjects with negative
      immunotest (all P<0.05). There were no differences in age, sex, hyposalivation,
      DMFT-index values nor with plasma levels of leukocytes, neutrophils or C-reactive
      protein between subjects with positive or negative aMMP-8 immunotest.
      CONCLUSIONS: aMMP-8 immunotest accuracy might be reduced, in relation to
      periodontitis, in haemato-oncologic patients.

      an OA derivative, was identified as a potent inhibitor of EGFR by using reverse
      pharmacophore screening and molecular dynamics simulation assays. Moreover,
      Western blot analysis showed that K73-03 markedly suppressed the levels of
      phosphorylated-EGFR (p-EGFR) and phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt). The inhibitory
      effect of K73-03 on PC cells was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, 
      K73-03 effectively inhibited the cell proliferation of PC cells, and induced
      apoptosis and autophagy of ASPC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally,
      pretreatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, significantly inhibited
      K73-03-induced autophagy and enhanced K73-03-induced apoptotic cell death. K73-03
      also strongly repressed ASPC-1 cells xenograft growth in vivo. Thus, all these
      findings provided new clues about OA analog K73-03 as an effective anticancer
      agent targeted EGFR against ASPC-1 cells, it is worth further evaluation in the
      future.

TI  - Acute kidney injury as the most important predictor of poor prognosis after
      interventional treatment for aortic stenosis.
LID - 10.33963/KP.a2022.0182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common acquired valvular disease.
      There are two methods of interventional treatment: surgical aortic valve
      replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The choice
      between SAVR and TAVI depends on the assessment of individual perioperative risk 
      and long-term treatment outcomes. It is essential to identify factors that may
      influence the outcomes of the treatment in order to minimize their negative
      effects. AIMS: The aim of the study was to identify the most important risk
      factor which affects treatment outcomes in patients with AS undergoing SAVR/TAVI.
      METHODS: This study reviewed retrospectively patients with AS who underwent SAVR 
      and TAVI. The primary outcomes included incidences of major adverse
      cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, stroke and
      hospitalization due to cardiovascular issues assessed over one-year follow-up
      period. An occurrence of postprocedural AKI (acute kidney injury) was identified 
      as the independent predictor of MACE. RESULTS: The study included 78 patients,
      the same number of subjects in each group (SAVR/TAVI [n = 39]). Twenty-nine
      patients developed AKI. It was similar in both groups (SAVR [n = 15]; TAVR [n =
      14]). In the SAVR group, 13 (33%) of patients developed at least one MACE
      compared to 5 (13%) of patients in the TAVI group. AKI and the type of procedure 
      (SAVR) were shown to be significantly and independently associated with the
      development of MACE (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively) as shown in the Cox
      multivariable regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that AKI is the
      strongest predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events after both methods of 
      aortic valve replacement (SAVR/TAVI).

TI  - Construction of a N,P doped 3D dendrite-free lithium metal anode by using
      silicon-containing lithium metal.
LID - 10.1039/d2dt01387h [doi]
AB  - Lithium is thought to be an excellent anode material for next-generation Li metal
      batteries (LMBs). However, some problems with lithium anodes often lead to
      serious safety concerns and catastrophic failures due to the huge volume change, 
      Li dendritic growth, and related side reactions. Therefore, in order to
      manufacture stable rechargeable batteries, the abovementioned serious problems
      must be effectively solved. In this paper, a three-dimensional N,P-doped
      silicon-containing lithium anode is designed and prepared by in situ metallurgy
      using low-cost Si3N4. The 3D stable composite anode (DLi/LiSix CA) was prepared
      by adding a small amount of Si3N4 to molten lithium to form N-doped
      silicon-containing lithium metal which was supported on a polyaniline modified
      carbon cloth (PMCC). The results show that the DLi/LiSix CA not only has high Li 
      affinity but can also effectively inhibit lithium nucleation and lithium
      dendritic growth, so as to maintain good structural stability in the process of
      Li plating/stripping. The new lithium metal anode based on doping and 3D carbon
      cloth shows good cycling stability and low polarizability in both symmetrical and
      full cells.

TI  - Relationships Among Environmental Variables, Physical Capacity, Balance
      Self-Efficacy, and Real-World Walking Activity Post-Stroke.
PG  - 15459683221115409
LID - 10.1177/15459683221115409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social and physical environmental factors affect real-world walking
      activity in individuals with stroke. However, environmental factors are often
      non-modifiable, presenting a challenge for clinicians working with individuals
      with stroke whose real-world walking is limited due to environmental barriers.
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to test a model hypothesizing the
      relationships among environmental factors (specifically, living situation and
      area deprivation), modifiable factors, and real-world walking activity to
      understand opportunities for intervention. We hypothesized that balance
      self-efficacy would mediate the relationship between the environment and
      real-world walking and that physical capacity would moderate this mediation.
      METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 282 individuals with chronic (>/=6
      months) stroke. We tested the indirect effect to determine if mediation was
      present. Multiple group structural equation modeling was used to test if physical
      capacity moderated this mediation. A chi(2) difference test was used to compare
      the moderation model against the null (no moderation) model. RESULTS: Balance
      self-efficacy mediated the relationship between area deprivation and real-world
      walking (indirect effect: beta = -0.04, P = .04). Both the moderation and null
      models fit the data equally well statistically (chi(2)(5) = 6.9, P = .23). We
      therefore accepted the simpler (null) model and concluded that the mediation was 
      not moderated. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting balance self-efficacy may be an effective
      approach to improving real-world walking in persons with stroke who experience
      barriers within the physical environment. A stroke survivor's physical capacity
      may not impact this approach. Future work should consider utilizing more specific
      measures of the social and physical environment to better understand their
      influences on real-world walking activity in individuals with stroke. However,
      the results of this work provide excellent targets for future longitudinal
      studies targeting real-world walking activity in stroke.

LID - keac415 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/keac415 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers for radiographic
      osteoarthritis severity and progression acting within the inflammation and
      metabolic pathways. METHODS: For 3,517 Rotterdam Study participants, 184 plasma
      protein levels were measured using Olink inflammation and cardiometabolic panels.
      We studied associations with severity and progression of knee, hip, hand
      osteoarthritis, and a composite overall OA burden-score by multivariable
      regression models, adjusting for age, sex, cell counts and BMI. RESULTS: We found
      18 significantly associated proteins for overall osteoarthritis burden, of which 
      5 stayed significant after multiple testing correction: circulating Cartilage
      acidic protein 1 (CRTAC1), Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP),
      Thrombospondin 4 (THBS4), Interleukin 18 receptor 1 (IL18R1) and Tumor necrosis
      factor ligand superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14). These proteins were also
      associated with progression of knee OA, with the exception of IL18R1. The
      strongest association was found for the level of CRTAC1 with 1 SD increase in
      protein level resulting in an increase of 0.09 (95%CI : 0.06-0.12) in overall
      osteoarthritis KLsum-score (p= 2.9x10-8), in the model adjusted for age, sex, BMI
      and cell counts. This association was also present with severity of
      osteoarthritis in all three joints, progression of knee osteoarthritis and was
      independent of BMI. We observed a stronger association for CRTAC1 with
      osteoarthritis than for the well-known osteoarthritis-biomarker COMP. CONCLUSION:
      We identified several compelling biomarkers reflecting overall osteoarthritis
      burden and increased risk for osteoarthritis progression. CRTAC1 was the most
      compelling and robust biomarker for osteoarthritis severity and progression. Such
      a biomarker may be used for disease monitoring.

TI  - Tailoring electronic structure of copper twin boundaries toward highly efficient 
      nitrogen reduction reaction.
LID - 10.1002/cssc.202201189 [doi]
AB  - Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising technique to
      resolve the carbon emission in energy-intensive ammonia production in industry,
      which however is hampered by the lack of efficient catalysts. Herein, by density 
      functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have demonstrated that the twin boundary
      (TB) of copper could effectively relieve the N 2 activation barrier in NRR. The d
      orbitals overlapping mode on twin boundary edge (TBE) is quite different from
      that on its basal plane, where the d xz , d yz orbitals have induced unbalanced
      electron occupation states in pi *- p x , p y orbitals of the adsorbed N 2 , thus
      can effectively activate the N identical withN bond. Particularly, doping
      transition metals (TMs) onto Cu-TBE could further improve its NRR catalytic
      behavior, and the Re-Cu(111)-TBE has performed the lowest limiting potential ( U 
      L ) of -0.27 V among 25 considered TMs. Moreover, the Re-Cu(111)-TBE could
      effectively suppress the competing HER even under working potentials. This work
      has provided a deep understanding of TB in catalysis from an electronic structure
      view, paving a way for further studies of TB into advanced utilization.

      profiles among adolescents in Australia.
LID - 10.1111/1753-6405.13288 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of cesarean section (C-section) with
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk biomarkers among Australian children. METHODS: 
      The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) birth cohort was
      prospectively followed for body mass index (BMI) trajectory, and then linked with
      CVD risk indicators of children; waist circumference (WC), systolic blood
      pressure (SBP), blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG),
      fat mass index (FMI) and composite metabolic syndrome (CMetS) score.
      Multivariable linear regression analysis was done to assess the association of
      C-sections with CVD risk biomarkers. RESULTS: Of 1,874 study children, 30% had
      C-sections; the mean age (SD) was 11.50 (0.50) years, and 49% were female.
      Against the vaginally-born cohort, Caesarean-born children showed a higher Z-
      score for five of the seven CVD risk indicators in regression analysis; WC (0.15;
      p=0.003), SBP (0.16; p=0.003), inverse HDL (0.15; p=0.003), FMI (0.12; p=0.004), 
      and CMetS (0.45; p=0.004) score. Children with accelerated BMI trajectory had
      higher CMetS scores for both the delivery types while the C-section cohort showed
      statistical association only (1.69; p=0.006) Conclusion: C-section was
      independently associated with increased CVD risk profiles of children, further
      increased with high BMI trajectory. Implication for public health: The chronic
      disease risk of C-sections should be discussed with families to reduce clinically
      unrequired C-sections.

TI  - Fracture strength of monolithic and glass-soldered ceramic sub-components of
      5-unit fixed dental prosthesis.
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13586 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Zirconium dioxide ceramic has been successfully introduced as a
      framework material for fixed dental prostheses. To reduce manufacturing
      constraints, joining of sub-components could be a promising approach to increase 
      the mechanical performance of long-span fixed dental prostheses. In this
      experimental study, the biomechanical behavior of monolithic and soldered
      framework specimens for fixed dental prostheses made of Y-TZP was investigated.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Framework specimens (n = 80) of 5-unit fixed dental
      prostheses made of Y-TZP were prepared and divided into 10 equal groups. The
      specimens were monolithic or composed of sub-components, which were joined using 
      a silicate-based glass solder. Thereby, three joint geometries (diagonal,
      vertical with an occlusal cap, and dental attachment-based) were investigated.
      Moreover, the groups differed based on the mechanical test (static vs. dynamic)
      and further processing (veneered vs. unveneered). The framework specimens were
      cemented on alumina-based jaw models, where the canine and second molar were
      acting as abutments, before a point-load was applied. In addition, muCT scans and
      microscopic fractography was used to evaluate the quality of soldered joints and 
      to determine the causes of fracture. RESULTS: The determined fracture loads of
      the different unveneered framework specimens in static testing did not vary
      significantly (p = 1). Adding a veneering layer significantly increased the
      mechanical strength for monolithic framework specimens from 1,196.29 +/-203.79 N 
      to 1,606.85 +/-128.49 N (p = 0.008). In case of soldered specimens with a dental 
      attachment-based geometry the mechanical strength increased from 1,159.42
      +/-85.65 N to 1,249.53 +/-191.55 N (p = 1). Within the dynamic testing, no
      differences were observed between monolithic and soldered framework specimens.
      muCT scans and fractography proved that the dental attachment-based joining
      geometry offers the highest quality. CONCLUSION: Using glass soldering
      technology, sub-components of 5-unit framework specimens made of Y-TZP could be
      joined with mechanical properties comparable to those of monolithic frameworks.

TI  - Transfusion outcomes between regular and low yield pathogen reduced platelets
      across different patient populations in a single institution.
LID - 10.1111/trf.17043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogen reduction technology (PRT) effectively mitigates bacterial
      contamination in platelets but is more likely to produce low yield units.
      Although low dose transfusion using conventional platelets has not been
      associated with increased bleeding, these findings have not been reproduced with 
      PRT-treated platelets. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Platelet transfusions in a
      tertiary adult hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Comparisons were made
      between PRT-treated regular (PRT-PR) and low (PRT-PL) yield platelets. Outcomes
      examined included the number of platelets and RBCs transfused, transfusion-free
      interval, and corrected count increment (CCI). Subgroup analyses were also
      performed on hematology-oncology inpatients and outpatients, as well as
      non-hematology-oncology patients. RESULTS: Platelet utilization per patient
      remained mostly unchanged (mean 2.9-4.3 units per patient per month) even when
      the frequency of PRT-PL transfusion increased. Among 1402 patients examined, the 
      number of platelets and RBCs transfused was not significantly different between
      patients first transfused with PRT-PR versus PRT-PL (mean number of platelet
      units = 2.8 vs. 3.1, p = 0.38; mean number of RBC units = 4.8 vs. 4.3, p = 0.93).
      Among 10,257 platelet transfusions examined, the transfusion-free interval
      (hazard ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.10) and CCI (10.2 vs. 11.0, 
      p = 0.70) were comparable between PRT-PR and PRT-PL units. Similar findings were 
      observed in all subgroups, except for shortened transfusion-free intervals among 
      hematology-oncology inpatients. CONCLUSION: PRT-PR and PRT-PL units may be used
      in an equivalent manner to maintain an adequate platelet inventory, since there
      was only a minor difference in time between transfusions.

PG  - e0052722
LID - 10.1128/aac.00527-22 [doi]
AB  - Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria cause infections
      associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Currently, a leading
      regimen to treat infections caused by MBL-producing bacteria is aztreonam
      combined with ceftazidime-avibactam. The purpose of the present study was to
      evaluate and rationally optimize the combination of aztreonam and
      ceftazidime-avibactam with and without polymyxin B against a clinical Klebsiella 
      pneumoniae isolate producing NDM-1 and CTX-M by use of the hollow fiber infection
      model (HFIM). A novel de-escalation approach to polymyxin B dosing was also
      explored, whereby a standard 0-h loading dose was followed by maintenance doses
      that were 50% of the typical clinical regimen. In the HFIM, the addition of
      polymyxin B to aztreonam plus ceftazidime-avibactam significantly improved
      bacterial killing, leading to eradication, including for the novel de-escalation 
      dosing strategy. Serial samples from the growth control and monotherapies were
      explored in a Galleria mellonella virulence model to assess virulence changes.
      Weibull regression showed that low-level ceftazidime resistance and treatment
      with monotherapy resulted in increased G. mellonella mortality (P < 0.05). A
      neutropenic rabbit pneumonia model demonstrated that aztreonam plus
      ceftazidime-avibactam with or without polymyxin B resulted in similar bacterial
      killing, and these combination therapies were statistically significantly better 
      than monotherapies (P < 0.05). However, only the polymyxin B-containing
      combination therapy produced a statistically significant decrease in lung weights
      (P < 0.05), indicating a decreased inflammatory process. Altogether, adding
      polymyxin B to the combination of aztreonam plus ceftazidime-avibactam for NDM-
      and CTX-M-producing K. pneumoniae improved bacterial killing effects, reduced
      lung inflammation, suppressed resistance amplification, and limited virulence
      changes.

AB  - Suicide is a major, preventable public health problem. The general factor of
      psychopathology ("p" factor) might help improve detection and prediction of
      individuals at risk for suicide. This cross-sectional proof-of-concept study
      tests whether the p-factor score is associated with suicidal thoughts and
      behaviors (STB) better than a depression scale alone. Youth (N = 841; mean age
      18.02, SD = 3.36) in primary care were universally screened using the Behavioral 
      Health Screen (BHS). Factor analysis and ROC results showed the BHS assesses the 
      p-factor, and the p-factor score demonstrates higher classification accuracy of
      several types of STB than a depression scale. The p-factor could help clinicians 
      in the identification of youths with STB.

TI  - Effect of Obesity on Resistin Concentrations in Normal, Pre-Obese and Obese
      Apparently Healthy Nigerian-Africans.
PG  - 791-702
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among Caucasians, conflicting findings exist on resistin in obesity
      and its relation to metabolic indices, with scarcity of such in
      Nigerian-Africans. Therefore, the study assessed plasma resistin and explored its
      relationship with obesity and selected cardiometabolic risks. METHODS: A
      cross-sectional comparative-analytical study on 87 randomly-selected non-diabetic
      Nigerians allocated into three groups by the WHO criteria: 24 normal; 23
      pre-obese and 40 obese. Resistin was measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Independent Kruskal-Wallis test
      determined differences in BMI categories. Spearman's correlation and Multivariate
      Logistic Regression assessed relationships. A sub-group analysis excluding
      subjects with first time incidental finding of high blood pressure, determined
      further associations. RESULTS: Resistin concentrations trended towards higher
      levels in obese than normal controls {Mean +/- SD, 6.72 +/- 4.25 ng/mL versus
      5.10 +/- 2.58 ng/mL}, with significantly (p<0.05) higher obesity indices, fasting
      insulin (FI) and HOMA-IR in obese than normal controls. Hyperresistinaemia
      involved 8(9.2%) subjects as against 79(90.8%) with normoresistinaemia, {Mean +/-
      SD, 15.1 +/- 2.6 ng/mL versus 5.3 +/- 2.8 ng/mL, (p<0.001)}. Log (Ln10)
      hyperresistinaemia was significantly (p<0.05) positively correlated to obesity
      indices (BMI, r=0.29, p=0.006; WC, r=0.23, p=0.04) but not to HOMA-IR, FI, FBG,
      SBP, DBP and age. Ln10 Hyperresistinaemia in females was significantly (p=0.05,
      OR: 1.12, 95% CI, 1.0-1.25) associated with central obesity by the IDF criteria
      in both unadjusted and step-wise age, sex, SBP & DBP adjusted models. Similar
      finding was for generalized obesity, albeit with low odds in all subjects
      (p=0.009), with persistence in the step-wise age, sex and SBP/DBP adjusted
      models. In the sub-group analysis, resistin showed similar findings to that of
      the whole sample population. CONCLUSION: Resistin concentrations trended towards 
      higher levels in obese than normal healthy non-diabetic Nigerian-Africans. Its
      lack of correlation with HOMA-IR and mild correlations/marginal relations to
      obesity indices may suggest possible interplay of other proinflammatory cytokines
      or hormones which may be evaluated in further studies.

TI  - Parent-Youth Sexual Discussion and its Association with Sexual Activity among
      Undergraduates in a Nigerian University.
PG  - 685-790
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parents play a significant role in the sexual orientation and
      behaviours of their children. Lack of communication between parents and their
      children about sexual matters may contribute to engagement of young people in
      risky sexual behaviours. OBJECTIVES: To assess the pattern of parent-youth sexual
      discussions and its association with sexual activity among unmarried
      undergraduates in a Nigerian university. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional
      study was conducted among 400 undergraduates aged 15-24 years in a tertiary
      institution in Ogun state, Nigeria. A structured selfadministered questionnaire
      was used for data collection. Data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for
      the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0. The level of significance was set at p
      <0.05. RESULTS: Parent-youth discussions on sexual issues had occurred in 225
      (56.2%) of the respondents, with mothers being more involved than fathers; onset 
      was at secondary school level in nearly three-fifths. There was no statistically 
      significant relationship between parent-youth sexual discussions and engagement
      in sexual intercourse (p = 0.666); however, parental visit(s) on campus was
      associated with a significant reduction in sexual intercourse (p = 0.006).
      CONCLUSION: Engagement of youths in sexual discussions by their parents is still 
      low and such discussions are often not impactful in preventing pre-marital sex.
      Parental supervisory visits for undergraduates on campus may be helpful in
      consolidating the desired effect of such sexual discussions, and should be
      encouraged.

TI  - Risk Factors Affecting the Survival Rate of Collagen Meniscal Implant for Partial
      Meniscal Deficiency: An Analysis of 156 Consecutive Cases at a Mean 10 Years of
      Follow-up.
PG  - 3635465221112635
LID - 10.1177/03635465221112635 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collagen meniscal implant (CMI) is a biologic scaffold that can be
      used to replace meniscus host tissue after partial meniscectomy. The short-term
      results of this procedure have already been described; however, little is known
      about risk factors for failure. PURPOSE: To determine the factors that predict
      failure of meniscal scaffold implantation in a large series of patients treated
      at a single institution and to better define the indications for surgery. STUDY
      DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The analysis included 
      186 consecutive patients with a minimum 5-year follow-up who underwent CMI
      scaffold implantation or combined procedures. Patients' characteristics and
      details of the surgery were obtained via chart review. Patients with a Lysholm
      score <65 were considered to have experienced clinical failure. Surgical failure 
      was defined as partial or total scaffold removal. RESULTS: The final analysis
      included 156 patients (84%) at a mean follow-up of 10.9 +/- 4.3 years. The
      patients' mean age at surgery was 42.0 +/- 11.1 years, and the survival rate was 
      87.8%. Subgroup analysis identified Outerbridge grade 3-4 (Hazard ratio [HR],
      3.8; P = .004) and a lateral meniscal implant (HR, 3.2; P = .048) as risk factors
      for failure. The survival rate was 90.4% for medial implants and 77.4% for
      lateral implants. An Outerbridge grade 3-4 (HR, 2.8; P < .001) and time from
      meniscectomy to scaffold >10 years (HR, 2.8; P = .020) were predictive of
      surgical or clinical failure. CONCLUSION: CMI for partial meniscal deficiency
      provided good long-term results, with 87.8% of the implants still in situ at a
      mean 10.9 years of follow-up. Outerbridge grade 3-4, lateral meniscal implants,
      and longer time from the meniscectomy to implantation of the CMI were identified 
      as risk factors for clinical and surgical failure.

TI  - A telehealth intervention for symptom management, distress, and adherence to
      adjuvant endocrine therapy: A randomized controlled trial.
LID - 10.1002/cncr.34409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients taking adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) after breast cancer 
      face adherence challenges and symptom-related distress. We conducted a randomized
      trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a
      telehealth intervention (Symptom-Targeted Randomized Intervention for Distress
      and Adherence to Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy [STRIDE]) for patients taking AET.
      METHODS: From October 2019 to June 2021, 100 patients reporting difficulty with
      AET were randomly assigned to either STRIDE or a medication monitoring (MedMon)
      control group. STRIDE included six weekly small-group videoconferencing sessions 
      and two individual calls. We defined feasibility as having >50% of eligible
      patients enroll, >70% complete the 12-week assessment, and > 70% of STRIDE
      patients complete >/=4/6 sessions. We monitored adherence with the Medication
      Event Monitoring System Caps (MEMS Caps). At baseline and 12- and 24-weeks after 
      baseline, patients self-reported adherence (Medication Adherence Report Scale),
      AET satisfaction (Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire), symptom distress
      (Breast Cancer Prevention Trial-Symptom Checklist), self-management of symptoms
      (Self-efficacy for Symptom Management-AET), coping (Measure of Current Status),
      quality of life (QOL; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast), and mood
      (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). We used linear mixed effects models to
      assess the effect of STRIDE on longitudinal outcomes. RESULTS: We enrolled 70.9% 
      (100/141) of eligible patients; 92% completed the 12-week assessment, and 86%
      completed >/=4/6 STRIDE sessions. Compared with MedMon, STRIDE patients reported 
      less symptom distress (B[difference] = -1.91; 95% CI, -3.29 to -0.52; p = .007)
      and better self-management of AET symptoms, coping, QOL, and mood. We did not
      observe significant differences in AET satisfaction or adherence. CONCLUSIONS:
      STRIDE is feasible and acceptable, showing promise for improving outcomes in
      patients taking AET after breast cancer. LAY SUMMARY: Patients taking adjuvant
      endocrine therapy (AET) after breast cancer may face challenges while following
      their treatment regimen. In this randomized controlled trial of 100 patients
      taking AET, a brief, small-group virtual intervention (STRIDE) was well-received 
      by patients and led to improvements in how upset patients were due to symptoms,
      how confident they were in managing symptoms, and how well they could cope with
      stress. Thus, STRIDE is a promising intervention and should be tested in future
      multi-site trials.

TI  - Asthma and asthma-related comorbidity: effects on nocturnal oxygen saturation.
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.10178 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Nocturnal symptoms are very common in asthma, which is
      associated with worse sleep quality. The nocturnal oxygen saturation may be
      decreased in asthma; however, whether this association is dependent on nocturnal 
      asthma symptoms, lung function, co-existing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or
      other asthma-related comorbidities is unknown. The objective of this study was to
      examine the effects of asthma, OSA, lung function, airway symptoms, and
      asthma-related comorbidities on the nocturnal oxygen saturation in a
      cross-sectional community-based population study. METHODS: In total, 395 women
      and 392 men underwent overnight polysomnography, performed spirometry and
      completed questionnaires on airway symptoms and asthma-related comorbidities.
      RESULTS: Participants with asthma (n=88) had a lower nocturnal oxygen saturation 
      than those without asthma (93.8% vs. 94.3%, p=0.01) also after adjusting for
      comorbidity, age, BMI, and smoking status (coefficient -0.38; CI -0.67, -0.10;
      p<0.01). The nocturnal oxygen saturation was lower among participants with
      wheezing, nocturnal chest tightness, fixed airflow limitation, gastroesophageal
      reflux, obesity, and OSA than in those without these conditions. The associations
      between lower oxygen saturation and wheezing, FEV1, gastroesophageal reflux, and 
      apnea-hypopnea index were significant also after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and
      smoking status. Participants with both wheezing and OSA had a significantly lower
      nocturnal oxygen saturation (92.5 +/-0.5%) than participants with wheezing only
      (94.3 +/-0.3%) and OSA only (93.6 +/-0.2% %) (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Participants 
      with asthma displayed a lower mean oxygen saturation during sleep, which could
      not only be explained by co-existing OSA or obesity. Also, asthma symptoms and
      lung function were associated with lower nocturnal oxygen saturation. The lower
      oxygen saturation seen in asthma is hence multifactorial in origin and is a
      result of the combination of symptoms, lung function, and comorbidity.

TI  - Perception and Learning Satisfaction of Resident Doctors Amid COVID-19 Pandemic: 
      Adaptation Experience at a Virtual Educational Course in Internal Medicine.
PG  - 678-684
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the perception of the significance of the 
      revision course and satisfaction of resident doctors with the West African
      College of Physicians (WACP) revision course in internal medicine. METHODS: This 
      was a post-training evaluation of resident doctors who had enrolled for the 2021 
      membership revision course in internal medicine between August 9-13, 2021. Data
      were collected through an electronic questionnaire composed of five sections:
      Sociodemographic characteristics, involvement in research, perception on the
      significance/expectations from the course, lessons learnt, and perception of the 
      overall coordination of the revision course/recommendations. Descriptive
      statistics were summarized using frequency tables. Chi-square tests were
      conducted to determine the association between participants' sociodemographic
      characteristics and satisfaction with the WACP revision course. RESULTS: The mean
      age (+/-SD) of the 119 resident doctors was 34.30 (+/- 4.81) years and the median
      duration (range) of residency training was 7 (4-10) years. All participants were 
      currently in medical practice either in teaching hospitals (104,87.4%) or
      secondary health facilities (15, 12.6%). Overall, 108 (90.8%) doctors were
      satisfied with the course. Variables that were associated with satisfaction with 
      the WACP revision course included: duration in residency training (doctors that
      had spent two years or less in the residency training programme) (Chi-square =
      21.703, p = <0.001), place of residency training (teaching hospitals) (Chi-square
      = 67.461, p = <0.001), and participation in research (Chi-square = 47.976, p =
      <0.001). CONCLUSION: The WACP revision course in internal medicine met its
      objectives. Engagement of resident doctors in research activities should be
      undertaken intensely.

TI  - Latent Tuberculosis among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Positive Patients:
      Prevalence and Correlates.
PG  - 670-677
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is the most common opportunistic infection affecting
      HIV-infected individuals and it remains the most common cause of death in
      patients with AIDS. Detection of latent tuberculosis and treatment largely
      prevents the development of active disease. OBJECTIVE: This study was to
      determine the prevalence and factors associated with latent TB in HIV-positive
      patients. METHODOLOGY: This is an analytical cross-sectional study which involved
      160 consented patients. Active tuberculosis was excluded using signs, symptoms
      and laboratory tests. All participants were tested using Quantiferon TB Gold Plus
      test kits. Data analysed with SPSS version 25.0 included patient's demographics, 
      clinical and laboratory features. P< 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS:
      The mean age of HIV-infected patients was 42.69 +/- 9.91 years and the mean age
      of the control was 41.29 +/- 9.20 years with no significant statistical
      difference. The prevalence of latent tuberculosis among HIV-infected patients was
      found to be 22.50% while among controls was 10.0% which was statistically
      significant (p-0.001). CD4 cells count was observed to inversely predict latent
      tuberculosis (OR = 1.41; CI = 1.01-3.73) while viral load was found to directly
      predict latent tuberculosis (OR = 1.63; CI=1.04-4.25). CONCLUSION: The prevalence
      of latent tuberculosis infection is significantly higher among HIV-positive
      patients when compared with HIV-negative patients. Also, the prevalence of HIV
      infection was higher amongst the female and less educated population.

TI  - Association between donor's age and expression of cardiomyocyte marker quantity
      on adipocyte-derived mesenchymal stem cell.
LID - 10.17392/1478-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim Adipocyte-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) have recently been studied
      as a potential new approach for regeneration treatment of heart failure and
      ischemic myocardium. However, donor's age is thought to affect the ability of
      AMSC cells to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. This study aimed to analyse the 
      association between donor's age with the expression of cardiomyocyte marker
      cardiac isoform of Troponin-T (cTnT) quantity on AMSCs. Methods Subcutaneous
      adipose tissue was taken from donors of 3 different age groups (30-40, 41-50, and
      >50 years old), and then processed into AMSC cells by insert culture. AMSC cell
      phenotype was identified by assessing the quantity of mesenchymal markers
      expression (CD34, CD45, CD90, CD105) using indirect immunofluorescence technique.
      Afterwards, cTnT expression, a marker for cardiomyocyte differentiation from AMSC
      cells, was evaluated under the fluorescent microscope. The comparison was done
      between the 3 different age groups. Results The comparative test and post hoc
      analysis showed that there were differences in the expression of CD34, CD45,
      CD90, CD105, and cTnT between the three age groups (all p<0.05). Furthermore,
      there were strong negative correlations between age and CD34, CD90, CD105 and
      cTnT (r= -0.844, -0.914, -0.899, and -0.738, respectively), while the correlation
      was positive between age and CD45 (r=0.899). Conclusion Expression quantity of
      mesenchymal markers and cardiomyocyte markers from AMSC cells were affected by
      the donor's age. The higher the donor age group, the lower the expression
      quantity of mesenchymal markers (except CD45) and cTnT.

TI  - Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC): an assessment of the
      diagnostic potential in histologically proven thyroid nodules.
LID - 10.17392/1469-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim Results of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) as the
      compatibility of cytological findings with histopathological diagnoses (the "gold
      standard") in the diagnosis of nodular thyroid lesions are inconsistent. The aim 
      of this prospective study was to determine the validity of FNAC, as well as the
      compatibility of findings with histopathological diagnoses. Methods The study
      included 92 patients who underwent FNAC and later surgery and histopathological
      assessment with a final diagnosis. Results FNAC showed 95% specificity, 78%
      sensitivity and 90% accuracy. The compatibility of the cytological and
      histopathological findings was good (Kappa coefficient of 0.756; 95% CI). The
      cytology results proved to be very good at predicting malignant histopathological
      findings, (OR=72.33; p<0.001). Also, the result of ROC analysis (AUC=0.866)
      confirmed FNAC as a very good method of distinguishing benign and malignant
      thyroid nodules. Conclusion The results confirmed the correctness of the
      algorithm in which, following clinical or ultrasound confirmation of nodular
      thyroid lesions with suspicious changes, FNAC is indicated. The FNAC results
      should guide a clinician to further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
      Certainly, in case of suspected follicular/ Hurthle cell lesions one should be
      vigilant and aware of the fact that in these cases malignancy is defined by the
      invasion of blood vessels and/or the capsule, which FNAC is unable to detect.

TI  - Vascular comorbidities in patients with multiple sclerosis and their impact on
      physical disability.
LID - 10.17392/1499-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim Given the impact of vascular comorbidities (VC) on the diagnosis, treatment, 
      and outcome of multiple sclerosis (MS), we examined the incidence and correlation
      of VC and risk factors for vascular disease in people with MS (PwMS) compared to 
      the general population, and the impact on the physical disability of patients.
      Methods Cross-sectional study involved 100 patients with MS and 50 healthy people
      from the general population, matched by sex and age. The values of demographic,
      biochemical, and anthropometric parameters, the presence of VC and risk factors
      for vascular diseases in both groups, and clinical parameters in PwMS were
      analysed. Statistical analysis included methods of descriptive statistics, chi2
      test, Student's t-test, analysis of variance, correlation and regression
      analysis. Results Groups differed by a higher frequency of transient ischemic
      attack in the control group (p=0.024), and the treatment of hypertension
      (p=0.038) and smoking frequency (p=0.044) in the MS group. Normal triglycerides
      levels were statistically significantly more prevalent in the MS group (p=0.000).
      Total body weight and BMI were statistically significantly higher in the control 
      group (p=0.000). The increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score
      was associated with higher levels of total (p=0.001) and low-density lipoprotein 
      (LDL) cholesterol (p=0.003), and activated partial thromboplastin time APTT
      (p=0.002). Conclusion In PwMS it is necessary to pay attention to the higher
      frequency of smoking than in general population, and the impact of total
      cholesterol, LDL and APTT levels as significant parameters that affect physical
      disability.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 vaccine on clinical characteristics and outcome of
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the fourth wave of the pandemic in Tuzla
      Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
LID - 10.17392/1500-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim To evaluate clinical and epidemiological characteristics and outcome of
      patients with COVID-19, and impact of vaccine against COVID-19 on them. Methods
      This retrospective study included 225 patients treated from COVID-19 in the
      period from 1 to 30 September 2021 at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases,
      University Clinical Centre Tuzla (UCC Tuzla). For the diagnosis confirmation of
      Covid-19, RTPCR was used. Patients were divided in two groups: fully vaccinated
      with two doses of vaccine, and non-vaccinated or partially vaccinated. Results Of
      225 patients, 120 (53.3%) were females, and 105 (46.7%) males. Mean age was 65.6 
      years. There were 26 (11.6%) fully vaccinated patients. Most common symptoms in
      unvaccinated patients were fatigue (70.9%), cough (70.4%) and fever (69.8%), and 
      in vaccinated fever (76.9%), fatigue (69.2%) and cough (46.2%). Cough was more
      common in unvaccinated patients (p=0.013). Fatal outcome happened in 84 (37.3%)
      patients. Transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and older age had a higher
      risk of death (p<0.001). Older age patients were more likely to have
      comorbidities like atrial fibrillation (p=0.017), hypertension (p<001) and
      diabetes mellitus (p=0.002). Atrial fibrillation (p<0.001), hypertension
      (p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (p=0.009) and history of stroke (p=0.026), were
      related to fatal outcome in unvaccinated patients, also did a shorter duration of
      illness prior to hospitalization (p<0.001) and shorter length of hospitalization 
      (p=0.002). Conclusion Older patients with comorbidities, as well as those who
      were not vaccinated against COVID-19, were at higher risk for severe form of the 
      disease and poor outcome.

      reconstructive surgery on the thoracic aorta.
LID - 10.17392/1496-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim To determine risk factors responsible for developing postoperative
      complications after the thoracic aorta reconstructive surgery. Methods Medical
      records of 100 patients, who had undergone elective or emergency thoracic aorta
      reconstructive surgery at the Clinic for Cardiovascular Surgery, University
      Clinical Center Tuzla, were analysed. Intraoperative data as cross-clamp time
      (CCT), duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPBT) and hypothermic circulatory
      arrest time (HCAT) were evaluated. Univariate analysis was used to show risk
      factors for developing postoperative cardiac, respiratory, surgical and renal
      complications. Results Between May 2019 and April 2021, 48 Bentall procedures
      (BP), 23 ascending aortic replacements (AAR), 20 BP and coronary artery bypass
      grafting (CABG) and 9 aortic valve replacements (AVR) with AAR were performed.
      Incidence of postoperative complications in the elective and emergency groups was
      as follows: respiratory 20% vs 38% (p=0.049), cardiac 18% vs 70% (p=0.015), renal
      16% vs 48% (p=0.027) and surgical 4% vs 6% (p>0.05). Intrahospital 30 days
      morbidity was 44% with mortality rate of 13%. The results showed that CPBT>180
      minutes was a risk factor for respiratory (p=0.034), cardiac (p=0.020) and renal 
      (p=0.027) postoperative complications after acute type A aortic dissection
      surgery. Conclusion CPBT > 180 min is a risk factor for postoperative development
      of respiratory, cardiac and renal complications. Postoperative cardiac and renal 
      complications were associated with longer HCAT.

TI  - A comparison of different doses of fentanyl for patients undergoing elective
      colonoscopy: a randomized double-blind clinical trial.
LID - 10.17392/1468-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim To investigate analgesic and side effects of different doses of fentanyl in
      combination with propofol for colonoscopy. Methods This prospective randomized
      double-blind study conducted between 2019 and 2020 included 64 patients. Patients
      were randomized: Group 1 (fentanyl 0.5 mug/kg) and Group 2 (fentanyl 1.0 mug/kg) 
      both in combination with propofol. Ramsay sedation score (RSS) was obtained at 5 
      with an additional dose of propofol. The primary outcome was the patient's
      postprocedural pain and adverse events during and after the procedure. Results
      The RSS means were statistically lower for Group 2 at the beginning and every 5
      minutes of the procedure. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) for Group 2 (first, 5, 25 
      and 30 min) was significantly lower (p=0.000, and heart rate (HR) was
      significantly higher for Group 1 (during the entire procedure) (p=0.000) than in 
      another group; peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) was significantly lower for
      measurements within both groups (Group 1, 5, 10, 15 min; Group 2, 5, 10,15 min)
      (p=0.000 and p=0.000, respectively). Anxiety (p=0.010), weakness (p=0.000) and
      confusion (p=0.023) proved to be significantly higher for Group 1, and
      hypotension (p=0.001) for Group 2 than in another group. No statistical
      significance of Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) (p=0.501) and Aldrete recovery
      score (ARS) (p=0.845) was found. Conclusion There was no significance in
      postprocedural abdominal pain between the group of patients administered fentanyl
      at a dose of 0.5 mug/kg and the group of patients administered fentanyl at a dose
      of 1.0 mug/kg; however, prevalence of complications was more significant in the
      group with a fentanyl at a dose of 0.5 mug/kg.

TI  - Prognostic value of colour Doppler brain sonography for the neurodevelopmental
      outcome in term neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy.
LID - 10.17392/1501-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim To determine a prognostic value of cerebral blood flow parameters for the
      development of neurological sequelae in term neonates with hypoxic ischaemic
      encephalopathy (HIE). Methods We reviewed medical records of 47 term neonates
      with HIE who survived until the age of 12 months of life. According to the Sarnat
      and Sarnat clinical score, neonates were divided into 3 groups: mild HIE,
      moderate HIE and severe HIE. All included neonates had the colour Doppler brain
      sonography performed in the first 24 hours of life. The neurological assessment
      was done at the age of 12 months of life by using the Denver Developmental
      Screening Test (DDST). Logic regression analysis was performed using the colour
      doppler brain sonography parameters with the development of neurological
      impairment as the primary outcome. Results Out of 47 neonates, 19 (40.4%) were
      with mild, 17 (36.2%) with moderate and 11 (23.4%) with severe HIE. The values of
      cerebral blood flow parameters and resistance index (RI) significantly correlated
      with the neurological impairment at the age of 12 months of life (p<0.001). The
      limit value of RI indicating the poor neurodevelopmental outcome was 0.81,
      sensitivity 80%, specificity 85.3%, positive predictive value 52.2% and negative 
      predictive value 95.2%. Conclusion The cerebral blood flow parameters measured
      with colour doppler brain sonography are good indicators of the severity of HIE
      and later neurodevelopmetal outcome.

      study.
LID - 10.17392/1490-22 [doi]
AB  - Aim To investigate the relationship between adherence to preventive behaviors and
      risk of COVID-19 infection. Methods In this case-control study, 491 participants 
      were selected through convenience sampling. First, the samples of the case group 
      (COVID-19 patients) were selected, and then the control group was matched with
      the case group based on age, gender, and occupation. The criteria for diagnosing 
      COVID-19 for the case group were self-reported positive PCR test or lung
      involvement on a chest CT scan. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the
      results, and an odds ratio was calculated to quantify the magnitude of the
      association using a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a p<0.05. Results The
      results showed that, compared to those who always wear a mask, the risk of
      contracting SARS-CoV-2 was 3.153 times higher in those who used no masks (95% CI:
      0.953-10.434) and 3.779 times higher in those who used masks occasionally (95%
      CI:1.929-7.37). The participants who never observed physical distancing and
      handwashing were 2.25 times more likely to get COVID-19 than those who always
      observed (95% CI:1.719-4.954; OR=2.258). Conclusion Participants who fail in
      following the protective measures, especially wearing a mask regardless of its
      type, had a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is recommended to
      use a mask consistently, especially during the peak of COVID-19 waves.

TI  - Establishment and characteristics of Perkinsus beihaiensis in vitro isolates from
      Mediterranean mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis.

AB  - Two monoclonal in vitro isolates of Perkinsus beihaiensis were established from
      tissues of infected Mediterranean mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, using a
      lipid concentrate and yeast extract medium (LpcYM) to induce enlarged
      prezoospoangia from histozoic trophozoites, and Perkinsus broth medium (PBM) to
      support subsequent zoosporulation and schizogonic proliferation from those cells.
      Zoospores of the isolates developed into uninucleate signet-ring trophozoites
      followed by schizonts typical of Perkinsus spp., but an additional type of
      unknown botryoidal cell clusters appeared and increased in density. These
      botryoidal cell clusters had second-generation daughter schizonts within which
      further internal cells were produced. Although botryoidal cell clusters in
      primary cultures rarely proliferated in PBM, cells contained by botryoidal
      clusters enlarged as prezoosporangia in LpcYM, and a large number of
      proliferative stages (i.e. trophozoites and schizonts typical for Perkinsus spp.)
      were obtained from these prezoosporangia in PBM. At lower cell density,
      trophozoites transformed into the botryoidal cell clusters in PBM, and the number
      of cells increased little, while trophozoites rapidly increased by typical
      schizogony at higher density in PBM. Based on these observations, we determined
      an optimal cell density for continuous culture of P. beihaiensis isolates,
      confirmed their ability to proliferate and survive after cryopreservation, and
      describe an experimental protocol to culture this most recently described species
      in the genus Perkinsus.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic profile of sarcin and thionin from Aspergillus giganteus and in
      vitro validation against human fungal pathogen.
LID - BSR20220229 [pii]
LID - 10.1042/BSR20220229 [doi]
AB  - Aspergillosis is a dreadful fungal infection and are more predominant in clinical
      fields. Due to the limitation of antifungal drugs, there is an emergence to
      develop efficient antifungal compounds from natural sources. Hence, the present
      study deals with the validation of active compounds from Aspergillus giganteus
      against aspergillosis causing Aspergillus fumigatus. The most prominent
      antifungal proteins in Aspergillus giganteus are sarcin, thionin and chitinase.
      Initially, the bioavailability and toxicological properties of sarcin, thionin,
      chitinase and their derivatives were screened. The molecular interaction of the
      screened antifungal proteins against the target proteins (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
      pyrophosphorylase, N-myristoyl transferase and Chitinase) of Aspergillus
      fumigatus was performed using Schrodinger module. The antagonistic potential of
      antifungal compounds on the pathogen was confirmed by SEM. The integrity of
      Aspergillus fumigatus cell membrane and nuclear membrane treated with antifungal 
      compounds were analysed by determining the release of cellular materials.
      Further, the GC-MS profiling of volatile bioactive compounds were analysed. The
      results have proved the efficiency of selected compounds for their
      pharmacokinetic properties. Molecular interactions of selected compounds from
      Aspergillus giganteus with the virulence proteins of Aspergillus fumigatus have
      exhibited a good glide score and their druggable nature. The SEM analysis have
      envisaged the shrunken and damaged spores of A. fumigatus treated with antifungal
      compounds. The effective concentration of antifungal compounds (AFCs) was found
      to be 250 microg/ml (p<0.0001). The GC-MS profiling has revealed the volatile
      bioactive metabolites present in Aspergillus giganteus. Conclusively, the
      selected antagonists from Aspergillus giganteus can be a good drug candidate to
      treat aspergillosis.

TI  - Unexplained regression in Down syndrome: Management of 51 patients in an
      international patient database.
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.62922 [doi]
AB  - Research to guide clinicians in the management of the devastating regression
      which can affect adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome is limited. A
      multi-site, international, longitudinal cohort of individuals with a clinical
      diagnosis of Unexplained Regression in Down syndrome (URDS) was collated through 
      seven Down syndrome clinics. Tiered medical evaluation, a 28-item core symptom
      list, and interim management are described naturalistically. Improvement-defined 
      by the percentage of baseline function on a Parent-reported Functional Score,
      overall improvement in symptoms on a Clinician-administered Functional
      Assessment, or report of management type being associated with improvement-was
      analyzed. Improvement rates using ECT, IVIG, and others were compared. Across
      seven clinics, 51 patients with URDS had regression at age 17.6 years, on
      average, and showed an average 14.1 out of 28 symptoms. Longitudinal improvement 
      in function was achieved in many patients and the medical management, types of
      treatment, and their impact on function are described. Management with
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was significantly associated with higher rate
      of improvement in symptoms at the next visit (p = 0.001). Our longitudinal data
      demonstrates that URDS is treatable, with various forms of clinical management
      and has a variable course. The data suggests that IVIG may be an effective
      treatment in some individuals. Our description of the management approaches used 
      in this cohort lays the groundwork for future research, such as development of
      standardized objective outcome measure and creation of a clinical practice
      guideline for URDS.

TI  - Large and anisotropic carrier mobility in monolayers of the MA2Z4 series (M = Cr,

LID - 10.1039/d2nr02382b [doi]
AB  - The recent discovery of synthetic two-dimensional materials has opened up a new
      paradigm for exploring novel transport and optical properties, beyond those found
      in naturally occurring materials. Here, we present a detailed investigation of
      the acoustic phonon limited intrinsic carrier mobility in MA2Z4 series (M = Cr,
      Mo, W; A = Si, Ge; and Z = N, P) monolayers. We find that out of the twelve
      monolayers studied, only two are metallic (CrGe2N4 and CrGe2P4), and the rest of 
      them are semiconducting. We demonstrate that the carrier mobilities in these
      monolayers are anisotropic and show a large variation, ranging from a small value
      of approximately 90 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) to a large value of approximately 10(4)
      cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). In addition, we show that strain engineering in these
      materials can further change the electronic band structure drastically, and
      change the carrier mobilities by up to a factor of 20. Our detailed and
      systematic study provides a useful platform for designing electronic devices
      based on the MA2Z4 family of materials.

TI  - Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor and Venous Thromboembolism in
      COVID-19.
PG  - e025198
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.122.025198 [doi]
AB  - Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) contributes significantly to COVID-19
      morbidity and mortality. The urokinase receptor system is involved in the
      regulation of coagulation. Levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator
      receptor (suPAR) reflect hyperinflammation and are strongly predictive of
      outcomes in COVID-19. Whether suPAR levels identify patients with COVID-19 at
      risk for VTE is unclear. Methods and Results We leveraged a multinational
      observational study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with suPAR and D-dimer 
      levels measured on admission. In 1960 patients (mean age, 58 years; 57% men; 20% 
      Black race), we assessed the association between suPAR and incident VTE (defined 
      as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) using logistic regression and
      Fine-Gray modeling, accounting for the competing risk of death. VTE occurred in
      163 (8%) patients and was associated with higher suPAR and D-dimer levels. There 
      was a positive association between suPAR and D-dimer (beta=7.34; P=0.002).
      Adjusted for clinical covariables, including D-dimer, the odds of VTE were 168%
      higher comparing the third with first suPAR tertiles (adjusted odds ratio, 2.68
      [95% CI, 1.51-4.75]; P<0.001). Findings were consistent when stratified by
      D-dimer levels and in survival analysis accounting for death as a competing risk.
      On the basis of predicted probabilities from random forest, a decision tree found
      the combined D-dimer <1 mg/L and suPAR <11 ng/mL cutoffs, identifying 41% of
      patients with only 3.6% VTE probability. Conclusions Higher suPAR was associated 
      with incident VTE independently of D-dimer in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.
      Combining suPAR and D-dimer identified patients at low VTE risk. Registration

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the main Candida species isolated from
      blood of cancer patients, to compare the taxonomic structure of strains obtained 
      from children and adults with candidemia. In total, during the study period,
      candidemia was microbiologically proven by blood culture in 81 patients
      (duplicates were excluded). Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) accounted
      for 35,8%. The total number of isolates elaborated was 82 strains of 10 Candida
      species. In general, in the taxonomic structure of candidemias, C. parapsilosis
      (61.0%) predominates, C. albicans (20.7%) is in the second place, followed by C. 
      glabrata and C. lusitaniae (3.7% each); C. krusei, C. guilliermondii and C.
      tropicalis (2.4% each). C. parapsilosis was statistically significantly often
      isolated from blood compared to C. albicans (61.0% versus 20.7%, respectively,
      p<0.0001). Candidemia was statistically significantly more often detected in
      adults than in children (63.0% versus 37.0%, respectively, p<0.002). Moreover, in
      adults, C. parapsilosis was statistically significantly more often isolated from 
      blood than C. albicans (70.6% versus 15.7%, respectively, p<0.0001). In children,
      there were no significant differences in the frequency of isolation of C.
      parapsilosis and C. albicans: the proportion of C. parapsilosis was 45.2%, C.
      albicans - 29.0%. Rare species were identified in 7.8% of cases in adults, and in
      12.9% of cases in children without statistical difference (p>0.05). The
      proportion of Candida non-albicans during the study period was 79.3%, and C.
      parapsilosis is the main species in this group (76.9%).

TI  - Testing the link between isoaspartate and Alzheimer's disease etiology.
LID - 10.1002/alz.12735 [doi]
AB  - Isoaspartate (isoAsp) is a damaging amino acid residue formed in proteins as a
      result of spontaneous deamidation. IsoAsp disrupts protein structures, making
      them prone to aggregation. Here we strengthened the link between isoAsp and
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) by novel approaches to isoAsp analysis in human serum
      albumin (HSA), the most abundant blood protein and a major carrier of amyloid
      beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in blood. We discovered a reduced
      amount of anti-isoAsp antibodies (P < 0.0001), an elevated isoAsp level in HSA (P
      < 0.001), more HSA aggregates (P < 0.0001), and increased levels of free Abeta (P
      < 0.01) in AD blood compared to controls. We also found that deamidation
      significantly reduces HSA capacity to bind with Abeta and p-tau (P < 0.05). These
      suggest the presence in AD of a bottleneck in clearance of Abeta and p-tau,
      leading to their increased concentrations in the brain and facilitating their
      aggregations there.

TI  - Clinical application of absorbable collagen thread and cosmetic suture technique 
      in emergency treatment of children's facial trauma.
LID - 10.1111/jpc.16147 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore the effect of absorbable collagen thread and cosmetic suture
      technique on scar inhibition after emergency facial trauma in children, and to
      explore the application value of absorbable collagen thread in emergency facial
      trauma. METHODS: Children who received emergency treatment of facial trauma in
      plastic surgery department from January 2021 to January 2022 were analysed
      retrospectively, and were divided into absorbable collagen thread group and
      non-absorbable nylon thread group. The general data, scar appearance and local
      symptoms of the two groups were analysed, and the scar appearance was scored by
      scar beauty rating scale and non-inferiority test was analysed statistically.
      RESULTS: A total of 632 children with facial trauma were included in this study, 
      including 458 patients with absorbable collagen thread and 174 patients with
      non-absorbable nylon thread. The SCAR score of the absorbable collagen thread
      group (3.03 +/- 1.57) was similar to that of the non-absorbable nylon thread
      group (2.98 +/- 2.39) (95% confidence interval), and the final scar outcome score
      was not statistically different (P > 0.05). All families of the patients were
      satisfied with the results of the procedure, 95% very satisfied. CONCLUSION: The 
      use of absorbable collagen thread and cosmetic suture technique to treat the
      wounds of children with facial emergency trauma, resulted in good wound healing, 
      little scar expansion, low incidence of erythema and pigment abnormality, no
      obvious surgical trace, and no scar hypertrophy or atrophy. The overall
      impression was good, the pain of stitch removal was avoided for children's
      patients, and the satisfaction of family members was high. Cosmetic suture
      technique with absorbable sutures is worthy of clinical application.

TI  - Lack of Attention to Sex and Gender in Periodontitis-Related Randomized Clinical 
      Trials: A meta-research study.
LID - 10.1111/jcpe.13707 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This meta-research study aimed to investigate the level of compliance with 
      the Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) Guidelines for the inclusion,
      analysis, and reporting of sex/gender, in periodontitis-related randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following the inclusion of RCTs 
      related to the treatment of periodontitis published between 2018-2019, we applied
      the SAGER checklist to assess the adherence to sex/gender reporting guidelines.
      We used non-parametric descriptive statistics and correlation models to test the 
      association of the dependent outcome with other variables. RESULTS: 101 articles 
      were included in the analysis. The female enrollment ranged between 30-94%. 26
      studies enrolled less than 50% of female participants. The overall SAGER score
      (OSS) of item fulfillment ranged between 0-7 items with an average of 1.9 items
      signifying poor guideline adherence to the SAGER guidelines. These findings were 
      not associated with the corresponding author gender (p= 0.623), publication year 
      (p=0.947), and funding source (p=0.133). However, a significant but negative
      correlation with journal impact factor (r=-0.253, p=0.026) was observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Sex and gender were frequently disregarded in clinical trial
      reporting. This oversight might limit the understanding of sex/gender differences
      in periodontitis-related clinical trials.

TI  - Ivermectin induces chicken BCRP/ABCG2 expression and function: Involvement of CXR
      signaling pathway and mRNA stabilization.
LID - 10.1111/jvp.13090 [doi]
AB  - Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone antiparasitic drug widely used in human and
      veterinary medicine. Previous studies indicated that ivermectin could interact
      with P-glycoprotein, being a good inducer and substrate; however, it is unknown
      whether ivermectin affects BCRP of chicken. In this study, we found that
      ivermectin distinctly affected the expression of BCRP in a time- and
      concentration-dependent up-regulatory way in chicken primary hepatocytes.
      Subsequent series of experiments showed that the BCRP induction is related with
      the increase of CXR expression and, promoting CXR translocations to the nucleus
      and enhancing the stability of Abcg2 mRNA at the post-transcriptional level by
      ivermectin. Furthermore, we observed that ivermectin also enhanced the stability 
      of Abcg2 mRNA at the post-transcriptional level by Act-D chase assay. We got the 
      similar results by in vivo test that ivermectin-induced BCRP and CXR expression
      in pharmacologically important tissues, and decreased the apparent permeability
      coefficient of florfenicol (substrate of chicken BCRP). In conclusion, the
      results indicated that ivermectin could induce chicken BCRP expression and
      function through the transcriptional CXR signaling pathway and
      post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization.

AB  - Cerclage wiring may be used for fracture fixation or osteotomy stabilization in
      revision arthroplasty. There is a lack of evidence regarding the potential risk
      of bacterial colonization for the different types of cerclages. The objective of 
      our research is to study the adhesion and biofilm formation of S. epidermidis, S.
      aureus, and P. aeruginosa on two different cerclage cable models, comparing a
      polymer cable and a stainless steel metal cable. A two-cm cerclage piece of each 
      material was submerged in 2 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB) inoculated with 10 muL 
      of a 0.5 McFarland bacterial culture, and incubated at 37 degrees C during 2 h
      for adhesion and 48 h for biofilm formation. The cerclages were washed with 1xPBS
      and sonicated in a new culture medium. Aliquots of several dilutions of each
      sonicated culture were spread in TSB agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h.
      The number of colonies was counted. The colony-forming units per ml (CFU/mL) and 
      the percentage of reduction were calculated. Experiments were triplicated. For P.
      aeruginosa, a statistically significant reduction in biofilm formation was found 
      on the polymer cerclage cable, compared to the metal cerclage cable. Reductions
      of 59% and 88%, after 2 h and 48 h, respectively, were observed. For S. epidermis
      and S. aureus, there was a trend towards lower bacterial adhesion and biofilm
      formation for the polymer cerclage cable. In summary, these results demonstrate
      that the braided polymer cerclage cable may be less prone to bacterial adherence 
      and biofilm formation compared to the braided metal cerclage cable.

TI  - Microbe-derived non-necrotic glycoside hydrolase family 12 proteins act as
      immunogenic signatures triggering plant defenses.
LID - 10.1111/jipb.13337 [doi]
AB  - Plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are sentinels at the cell surface
      sensing microbial invasion and activating innate immune responses. During
      infection, certain microbial apoplastic effectors can be recognized by plant
      PRRs, culminating in immune responses accompanied by cell death. However, the
      intricated relationships between the activation of immune responses and cell
      death are unclear. Here, we studied the apoplastic glycoside hydrolase family 12 
      (GH12) protein, Ps109281, secreted by Phytophthora sojae into the plant apoplast 
      during infection. Ps109281 exhibits xyloglucanase activity, and promotes P. sojae
      infection in a manner dependent on the enzyme activity. Ps109281 is recognized by
      the membrane-localized receptor-like protein RXEG1 and triggers immune responses 
      in various plant species. Unlike other characterized GH12 members, Ps109281 fails
      to trigger cell death in plants. The loss of cell death induction activity is
      closely linked to a sequence polymorphism at the N-terminus. This sequence
      polymorphism does not affect the in planta interaction of Ps109281 with the
      recognition receptor RXEG1, indicating that cell death and immune response
      activation are determined by different regions of the GH12 proteins. Such GH12
      protein also exists in other Phytophthora and fungal pathogens. Taken together,
      these results unravel the evolution of effector sequences underpinning different 
      immune outputs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

      Virus-Related Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure After Deceased Donor Liver
      Transplant.
PG  - 668-673
LID - 10.6002/ect.2022.0079 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure remains a
      life-threatening syndrome, and transplant is the definitive treatment. Early
      allograft dysfunction is a postoperative complication and affects morbidity and
      mortality. We studied the risk factors associated with early allograft
      dysfunction in livertransplantrecipients with hepatitis B virus-related
      acute-on-chronic liver failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center
      retrospective study of early allograft dysfunction is based on data from January 
      2015 to June 2020 for 323 recipients with hepatitis B virus-related
      acute-on-chronic liver failure and 445 with only hepatitis B virus infection
      (control group). Data that correlated with early allograft dysfunction and
      outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Incidence of early allograft dysfunction in
      patients with hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure was
      significantly higher versus the control group (39.3% vs 21.1%; P < .001).
      Transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus-related acute-onchronic liver
      failure who developed early allograft dysfunction had lower 90-day, 180-day, and 
      360-day patient survival rates versus patients with no early allograft
      dysfunction (89.0% vs 98.0%, 82.7% vs 97.5%, and 80.3% vs 96.4%, respectively; P 
      < .001). Pretransplant kidney failure (odds ratio, 2.644; 95% CI, 1.019-6.864; P 
      = .046), pretransplant coagulation failure (odds ratio, 2.162; 95% CI,
      1.291-3.621; P = .003), and operative time (odds ratio, 1.005; 95% CI,
      1.002-1.008; P = .003) were independent risk factors for early allograft
      dysfunction in liver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus-related
      acute-onchronic liver failure. There was a synergistic effect of early allograft 
      dysfunction and preoperative kidney/coagulation failure on survival rates of
      liver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver
      failure. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative kidney/coagulation failure and operative time 
      were independent risk factors of early allograft dysfunction in deceased donor
      liver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver
      failure. The combination of early allograft dysfunction and preoperative
      kidney/coagulation failure was significantly associated with lower survival of
      these recipients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) are widely used 
      in kidney transplant to prevent acute transplantrejection; however,the effects of
      these medications on graft sequelae after transplant remain unclear. We aimed to 
      compare early complications, including graftrejectionandinfectionrates after
      kidney transplant, in childrenbetween the cyclosporine and tacrolimus
      immunomodulator regimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort
      study, 105 pediatric patients who were candidates to receive kidney transplant in
      the age range of 4 to 18 years were included. There were 28 patients who received
      cyclosporine, and 77 patients who received tacrolimus. Participants were
      routinely tested for cytomegalovirus, BK virus, and bacterial infection on a
      monthly basis for the first 3 months and once every 3 months thereafter for the
      first year. The graft rejection rate was also assessed and compared between the 2
      treatment regimens. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the 2 
      groups receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus in graft rejection rate (P = .719),
      cytomegalovirus viremia (P = .112), BK viremia (P = .278), and bacterial
      infection (P = .897). Graftfailure was significantly more frequent in male than
      in female patients (30.9% vs 8.2%; P = .004). The rates of graft failure in study
      patients with and without previous history of graftfailure were found to be
      statistically similar (16.7% vs 20.4%; P = .825). History of infection in donors 
      did not affect the graft complications posttransplant in recipients. CONCLUSIONS:
      The use of either tacrolimus or cyclosporine leads to similar consequences in
      terms of graft rejection or posttransplant viral and bacterial infection, so
      either drug may be exchanged for the other if needed for tolerability.

TI  - Personality traits as mediators of the relationship between childhood trauma and 
      depression severity in bipolar disorder: A structural equation model.
PG  - 48674221115644
LID - 10.1177/00048674221115644 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood trauma is negatively associated with depression severity in
      bipolar disorder; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We
      investigated whether personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness,
      agreeableness, conscientiousness) mediate the relationship between childhood
      trauma and the severity of bipolar depression. METHODS: Data from 209 individuals
      with bipolar disorder recruited for the Prechter Longitudinal Study of Bipolar
      Disorder were analysed. Using structural equation modelling, we examined the
      direct and indirect associations between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma
      Questionnaire) and depression severity (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) - with 
      the personality traits (NEO Personality Inventory-Revised) as mediators. RESULTS:
      The direct effect of childhood trauma on depression severity (standardised beta =
      0.32, 95% bootstrap confidence interval [CI] = 0.20-0.45, p < 0.001) and the
      indirect effect via neuroticism (standardised beta = 0.03, 95% bootstrap CI
      [0.002, 0.07], p = 0.039) were significant; supporting a partial mediation model.
      The indirect effect accounted for 9% of the total effect of childhood trauma on
      depression severity (standardised beta = 0.09, 95% bootstrap CI [0.002, 0.19], p 
      = 0.046). The final model had a good fit with the data (comparative fit index =
      0.96; root mean square error of approximation = 0.05, 90% CI = [0.02, 0.07]).
      CONCLUSION: Personality traits may be relevant psychological mediators that link 
      childhood trauma to a more severe clinical presentation of bipolar depression.
      Consequently, a person's personality structure may be a crucial operative factor 
      to incorporate in therapeutic plans when treating individuals with bipolar
      disorder who report a history of childhood trauma.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex disorder characterized by degenerative articular
      cartilage in which inflammatory mechanisms play a major role in the pathogenesis.
      Interleukin-6 (IL6), a multifunctional cytokine, can trigger osteoclast
      differentiation and bone resorption. Our purpose in this study was to evaluate
      the association of IL-6 -174 G/C (rs1800795) and -572 G/C (rs1800796) variants
      with the susceptibility to OA. One hundred fifty OA patients and 150 healthy
      individuals were enrolled in the study. Polymerase chain reaction restriction
      fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used for genotyping the IL-6 gene
      variants. The results of analyses were evaluated for statistical significance.
      The pain intensity was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). There was 
      a statistically significant difference in the genotype and allele frequencies of 
      the IL-6 -174 G/C variant between patients with OA and control groups (p = 0.001,
      p = 0.002, respectively). IL-6 -174 G/C GG genotype and G allele were more
      prevalent in patients with OA. We found that the IL-6 -572 G/C variant was not
      different between patients and controls in either genotype distribution and
      allele frequency. IL-6 174 G/C and -572 G/C loci GG-GG combined genotype was
      significantly higher in OA patients (p = 0.00). Our study suggests that there was
      a strong association between the IL-6 -174 G/C variant and OA in the Turkish
      population. Further studies on populations of different ethnic background are
      necessary to prove the association of IL-6 variants with OA.

      Malaria in Hodeidah, Yemen: Considerations for Assessing Iron Status.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1080/03630269.2022.2083970 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the key regulator of iron homeostasis is critical to the
      improvement of iron supplementation practices in malaria-endemic areas. This
      study aimed to determine iron indices and hepcidin (HEPC) level in patients
      infected with Plasmodium falciparum compared to apparently healthy,
      malaria-negative subjects in Hodeidah, Yemen. The study included 70 Plasmodium
      falciparum-infected and 20 malaria-negative adults. Blood films were examined for
      detection and estimation of parasitemia. Hemoglobin (Hb) level was measured using
      an automated hematology analyzer. Serum iron and total iron binding capacity
      (TIBC) were determined by spectrophotometric methods. Levels of serum ferritin
      (FER) and HEPC were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Data were
      stratified by sex and age. Comparable Hb levels were found in P.
      falciparum-infected patients and malaria-negative subjects in each sex and age
      group (p > 0.05). Compared to their malaria-negative counterparts, disturbed iron
      homeostasis in patients was evidenced by the significantly lower serum iron
      levels in females (p = 0.007) and those aged <25 years (p = 0.02) and the
      significantly higher TIBC in males (p = 0.008). Levels of serum FER and HEPC were
      significantly elevated in P. falciparum-infected patients compared to the
      corresponding malaria-negative participants (p < 0.001). Serum FER correlated
      positively with parasite density (p = 0.004). In conclusion, patients with
      uncomplicated P. falciparum in Hodeidah display elevated levels of serum HEPC and
      FER. Hemoglobin level may not reflect the disturbed iron homeostasis in these
      patients. The combined measurement of iron indices and HEPC provides
      comprehensive information on the iron status so that the right intervention can
      be chosen.

TI  - The Influence of Gender Bias: Is Pain Management in the Field Affected by Health 
      Care Provider's Gender?
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1017/S1049023X2200111X [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Appropriate pain management indicates the quality of casualty care 
      in trauma. Gender bias in pain management focused so far on the patient. Studies 
      regarding provider gender are scarce and have conflicting results, especially in 
      the military and prehospital settings. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study
      is to investigate the effect of health care providers' gender on pain management 
      approaches among prehospital trauma casualties treated by the Israel Defense
      Forces (IDF) medical teams. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all
      trauma casualties treated by IDF senior providers from 2015-2020. Casualties with
      a pain score of zero, age under 18 years, or treated with endotracheal intubation
      were excluded. Groups were divided according to the senior provider's gender:
      only females, males, or both female and male. A multivariate analysis was
      performed to assess the odds ratio of receiving an analgesic, depending on the
      presence of a female senior provider, adjusting for potential confounders. A
      subgroup analysis was performed for "delta-pain," defined as the difference in
      pain score during treatment. RESULTS: A total of 976 casualties were included, of
      whom 835 (85.6%) were male. Mean pain scores (SD) for the female only, male only,
      and both genders providers were 6.4 (SD = 2.9), 6.4 (SD = 3.0), and 6.9 (SD =
      2.8), respectively (P = .257). There was no significant difference between
      females, males, or both female and male groups in analgesic treatment, overall
      and per specific agent. This remained true also in the multivariate model.
      Delta-pain difference between groups was also not significant. Less than
      two-thirds of casualties in this study were treated for pain among all study
      groups. CONCLUSION: This study found no association between IDF Medical Corps
      providers' gender and pain management in prehospital trauma patients. Further
      studies regarding disparities in acute pain treatment are advised.

TI  - The efficacy of the American College of Surgeons Surgical Risk Calculator in the 
      prediction of postoperative complications in oncogeriatric patients after
      curative surgery for abdominal tumors.
LID - 10.1002/jso.27046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons (ACS) has developed a Surgical Risk 
      Calculator (SRC) to predict postoperative surgical complications. No studies have
      reported the performance of the ACS-SRC in oncogeriatric patients. Our objective 
      was to evaluate the predictive performance of the ACS-SRC in these patients,
      treated with curative surgery for an abdominal malignancy. METHODS: This is a
      retrospective study including 136 patients who underwent elective abdominal
      oncological surgery, between 2017 and 2019, at our institution. Postoperative
      complications were classified according to the ACS-SRC, and its predictive
      performance was analyzed by assessing discrimination and calibration and using
      receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS:
      Discrimination was adequate with AUC of 0.7113 (95% confidence interval [CI]:
      1.062-1.202, p = 0.0001; Brier 0.198) for serious complications and 0.7230 (95%
      CI: 1.101-1.756, p = 0.0057; Brier 0.099) for pneumonia; and poor for sepsis,
      surgical site infection (SSI), and urinary tract infection (UTI) with AUCs of
      0.6636 (95% CI: 1.016-1.353, p = 0.0299; Brier 0.142), 0.6167 (95% CI:
      1.003-1.266, p = 0.0450; Brier 0.175), and 0.6598 (95% CI: 1.069-2.145, p =
      0.0195; Brier 0.082), respectively. CONCLUSION: The ACS-SRC is an adequate
      predictor for serious complications and pneumonia in oncogeriatric patients
      treated surgically for abdominal cancer. However, the predictive power of the
      calculator appears to be low for sepsis, UTI, and SSI.

TI  - The West China Hospital radiographic classification for fibrous dysplasia in
      femur and adjacent bones: A retrospective analysis of 205 patients.
LID - 10.1111/os.13404 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the reliability and clinical outcome of
      a newly developed classification system for patients with fibrous dysplasia (FD) 
      of the femur and adjacent bones, optimizing its evaluation and management.
      METHODS: A total of 205 patients (121 female and 84 male) with FD in the femur
      and adjacent bones were included in this retrospective study. All affected femurs
      were measured and treated based on this classification at our institution between
      2009 and 2019. Based on previous studies and extensive clinical follow-up, we
      cautiously proposed the West China Hospital radiographic classification for FD in
      femur and adjacent bones following corresponding treatment options. There are
      five types with five radiographic features, including proximal femur bone loss,
      coxa vara, femoral shaft deformity, genu valgum, and hip arthritis. The
      intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of this classification was
      assessed by four observers using the Cohen kappa statistic. The clinical outcome 
      was evaluated using the criteria of Guille. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 60 
      months (range 6-120), 205 patients (median 34.8 years old, range 18-73 years old)
      were categorized into the following five types: Type I 31.7%, Type II 30.2%, Type
      III 20.5%, Type IV 10.2%, and Type V 7.3%. The mean interobserver and
      intraobserver kappa scores were 0.85 (range 0.77-0.89) and 0.85 (range
      0.79-0.92), respectively. For clinical outcomes, there was no significant
      difference in the postoperative Guille score for Type I patients (mean 9.01 +/-
      1.22). There was a significant increase in the postoperative Guille score in Type
      II, III, IV, and V, compared to the preoperative values (P < 0.01). For
      complications, two Type III patients reported pain, and one Type III patient had 
      mild-to-moderate Trendelenburg gait. One Type IV patient had a mild Trendelenburg
      gait. And two Type V patients still had mild limping. CONCLUSION: This
      classification is reproducible and serves as a tool for evaluating and treating
      FD in the femur and adjacent bones. Therefore, we recommend this classification
      for the diagnosis and treatment of FD-related deformities in the femur and
      adjacent bones.

TI  - Predictive Indicators for Complications of Proximal Humerus Fractures Treated
      with Locking Plate or Intramedullary Nail Fixation.
LID - 10.1111/os.13421 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the best placement of calcar
      screws in proximal humerus fracture surgeries. METHODS: This retrospective cohort
      study included clinical and radiographic outcomes of 98 patients treated with
      proximal humerus fracture surgeries between January 2017 and June 2020.
      Demographic data of patients were obtained from medical records. The surgical and
      radiographic results were also collected: operation time, blood loss, time to
      surgery, fibular allograft, disruption of medial region hinge, Neer
      classification, and recovery of medial support. Patients were allocated into two 
      groups: the locking plate group (n = 65) and the intramedullary nail group (n =
      33). In this study, we proposed new predictive indicators, named horizontal ratio
      (HR) and vertical ratio (VR), to quantify the placement of calcar screws in these
      two groups. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to
      display the accuracy of these indicators. Shoulder activity, visual scale analog 
      (VAS) score, and Constant score were performed to evaluate postoperative clinical
      outcomes at 1 year follow-up. RESULTS: In the multivariate logistic regression
      analysis, only time to surgery and effective medial support were considered
      statistically significant factors of postoperative complications (p < 0.05).
      Significant differences were observed between medial support and postoperative
      complications both in the locking plate group and the intramedullary nail group
      (p < 0.05). Only the vertical ratio of locking plate (VRLP) was a statistically
      significant predictor of postoperative complications (p < 0.05). The area under
      curve was calculated to assess the predictive value of VRLP, which came to 0.84. 
      In addition, a ROC analysis found quantifiable thresholds of the VR was 0.1713 as
      measures to avoid postoperative complications in the locking plate fixation.
      CONCLUSION: In locking plate fixation, the incidence of postoperative
      complications increased significantly when the VR of calcar screws greater than
      0.1713, which was beneficial to surgeons to place calcar screws.

TI  - Feasibility of Computer-Aided Design in Limb Lengthening Surgery: Surgical
      Simulation and Guide Plates.
LID - 10.1111/os.13328 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and utility of computer-aided design (CAD)
      in surgical treatment of leg length discrepancy (LLD) using monorail external
      fixators. METHODS: In the present case series, we retrospectively analyzed seven 
      patients diagnosed with LLD who were surgically treated using a monorail external
      fixator between June 2018 and August 2020. A personalized surgical emulation of
      each patient was designed using CAD based on preoperative CT scans to measure
      limb parameters. Through reverse engineering, a surgical guide plate was then
      designed to assist with correcting the limb deformity. Patient general
      information and clinical history, leg length, mechanical lateral distal femoral
      angle (mLDFA), anatomical anterior distal tibial angle (aADTA), and surgical
      parameters were recorded during the perioperative period. Three months after
      external fixator removal, distraction-consolidation time (DCT), healing index
      (HI), and lower extremity function score (LEFS) were calculated, and
      statistically analyzed by paired T-test. RESULTS: The mean limb lengthening
      achieved was 6.41 +/- 2.54 (range, 3.30-10.54) cm with either varus or valgus
      correction. The mean operative duration was 151 +/- 41.87 (84-217) minutes and
      mean blood loss was 53.58 +/- 22.51(25-87) ml. The mean distraction-consolidation
      time was 3.67 +/- 1.13 (range, 2.5-6.0) months and mean external fixator duration
      was 11 +/- 2.45 (range, 8-14) months. The mean healing index (HI) was 18.11 +/-
      3.58 (range, 12.8-22.7) days/cm. Mean LEFS scores improved postoperatively from
      32.17 +/- $$ \pm $$ 8.57 (range, 24-45) to 61.17 +/- $$ \pm $$ 6.68 (range,
      50-67) with a significant difference (T = -14.26,P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Simultaneous length and angular correction can be achieved by incorporating CAD
      into the surgical treatment of patients with LLD, without compromising
      postoperative lower limb function. CAD demonstrates utility in the surgical
      treatment of LLD by improving the functionality of monorail external fixators.

TI  - Comparison of Single-Radius with Multiple-Radius Femur in Total Knee
      Arthroplasty: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Randomized Controlled Trials.
LID - 10.1111/os.13391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether there was clinical superiority for the single-radius
      prosthesis over the multi-radius prothesis in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) still
      remains to be clarified. We updated a meta-analysis including prospective
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the clinical prognosis of patients
      receiving single-radius TKA (SR-TKA) or multi-radius TKA (MR-TKA). METHODS: We
      searched the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library,
      MEDLINE for eligible RCTs. Two reviewers evaluated the study quality according to
      the Risk of Bias tool of the Cochrane Library and extracted the data in studies
      individually. The extracted data included the baseline data and clinical outcome.
      The baseline data include the author's name, country, and year of included
      studies, the name of knee prosthesis used in studies, sample size, follow-up
      time, and BMI of patients. The clinical data comprised primary indicators
      including postoperative knee range of motion (ROM), sit-to-stand rest, severe
      postoperative scorings, such as visual analog scale (VAS), American Knee Society 
      knee score (AKS), Oxford knee scoring (OKS), and SF-36 Quality of Life Scale, as 
      well as various secondary indicators of complications including anterior knee
      pain, postoperative infection, aseptic prosthesis loosening, and prosthesis
      revision. The data analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software and
      STATA 12.0. The sensitivity analysis was performed using STATA 12.0. RESULTS: A
      total of 13 RCTs, along with 1720 patients and 1726 knees, were finally included 
      in our present meta-analysis. We found that patients in SR-TKA group performed
      better in the sit-to-stand test (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.05-3.41, p = 0.03) and
      satisfaction evaluation (OR = 3.27, 95% CI: 1.42-7.53, p = 0.005), which were
      only evaluated in two included RCTs. While no significant difference was found
      between SR-TKA and MR-TKA groups in terms of postoperative ROM, VAS scoring, AKS 
      scoring, SF-36 scoring, OKS scoring, and various complications including anterior
      knee pain, postoperative infection, aseptic prosthesis loosening, and prosthesis 
      revision. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our present meta-analysis indicated that SR 
      implants were noninferior to MR implants in TKA, and SR implants could be an
      alternative choice over MR implants, since patients after SR-TKA felt more
      satisfied and performed better in the sit-to-stand test, with no significant
      difference in complications between SR-TKA and MR-TKA groups. While more relevant
      clinical trials with long-term follow-up time and specific tests evaluating the
      function of knee extension mechanism should be carried out to further investigate
      the clinical performance of SR implants.

      susceptibility to Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Infection in Blood
      Donors of Mashhad, Iran.
LID - 10.1111/1348-0421.13022 [doi]
AB  - Mannose binding lectin-associated serine protease 2 (MASP2) is the effector part 
      of mannose binding lectin (MBL) that activates the complement system in an
      antibody-independent manner. We aimed to investigate the role of genetic
      polymorphisms in the MASP2 gene and susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection. A total
      of 172 HTLV-1 infected individuals and 170 healthy blood donors were analyzed in 
      this case-control study. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encompassing
      different regions of the MASP2 gene were genotyped with a PCR-SSP assay. The
      relation between SNPs genotype and susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection was
      investigated with a chi-squared test considering p<0.05 as statistically
      significant. Two out of nine tested SNPs were associated with the risk of HTLV-1 
      infection. The genotype TT at rs17409276 decreased the risk of HTLV-1 (p=0.005,
      OR=0.301, 95% CI=0.124-0.728). The genotypes CC and CT at rs2273346 were also
      associated with a higher risk of HTLV-1 acquisition (p=0.004, OR=2.225, 95%
      CI=1.277-3.877). These findings highlight the importance of MASP2 genetic
      polymorphisms in the lectin pathway of complement activation and susceptibility
      to HTLV-1 infection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Humoral and cellular response of COVID-19 vaccine among solid organ transplant
      recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1111/tid.13926 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to analyze the humoral and cellular response to standard and
      booster (additional doses) COVID-19 vaccination in solid organ transplantation
      (SOT) and the risk factors involved for an impaired response. METHODS: We did a
      systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published up until January 11,
      2022, that reported immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccine among SOT. The study is
      registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42022300547 RESULTS: : Of the 1527 studies,
      112 studies which involved 15391 SOT and 2844 healthy controls were included. SOT
      showed a low humoral response [effect size (ES): 0.44(0.40-0.48)] in overall and 
      in control studies [log-Odds-ratio (OR): -4.46 (-8.10 to -2.35)]. The humoral
      response was highest in liver [ES: 0.67(0.61-0.74)] followed by heart [ES:
      0.45(0.32-0.59)], kidney [ES: 0.40(0.36-0.45)], kidney-pancreas [ES: 0.33(0.13 - 
      0.53)], and lung [0.27(0.17-0.37)]. The meta-analysis for standard and booster
      dose [ES: 0.43(0.39-0.47) versus 0.51(0.43-0.54)] showed a marginal increase of
      18% efficacy. SOT with prior infection had higher response [ES: 0.94(0.92- 0.96) 
      vs ES: 0.40(0.39-0.41); p-value < 0.01). The seroresponse with mRNA-12723 mRNA
      was highest 0.52(0.40-0.64). Mycophenolic acid [OR: 1.42 (1.21 to 1.63)] and
      Belatacept [OR: 1.89 (1.3 to 2.49)] had highest risk for non-response. SOT had a 
      parallelly decreased cellular response [ES: 0.42(0.32-0.52)] in overall and
      control studies [OR: -3.12(-0.4.12 to -2.13)] INTERPRETATION: Overall, SOT
      develops a suboptimal response compared to the general population.
      Immunosuppression including mycophenolic acid, belatacept, and tacrolimus is
      associated with decreased response. Booster doses increase the immune response,
      but further up-gradation in vaccination strategy for SOT is required. This

TI  - Randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of audio-visual health educational
      materials on CPAP adherence: the AHEAD trial.
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.10182 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Educational interventions have been proposed to improve
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence, however studies to date
      have not demonstrated robust effectiveness, due to methodological issues.
      Furthermore, these educational interventions have not specifically targeted low
      health literacy communication techniques, which have been demonstrated to improve
      outcomes in numerous other chronic diseases. We hypothesized that the addition of
      low-cost audio-visual educational videos to usual standard of care education
      would improve CPAP adherence, in incident adults with obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome. METHODS: At CPAP initiation, treatment naive adults with obstructive
      sleep apnea syndrome were randomized to: (a) usual standard of care (SC); or (b) 
      SC + 5 educational videos (EV) showing a patient journey, designed with low
      health literacy communication techniques to teach patients about OSA and CPAP
      therapy. Primary endpoint was CPAP usage at 2 months (h/night) and secondary
      endpoints were CPAP usage at 12 months and % patients with >/= 4 h/night use at 2
      months and 12 months. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-five patients were
      randomized (SC 99, EV 96), with a mean age of 57 years (IQR 44.1-64.8). There
      were no statistically significant differences in patient characteristics at
      baseline between the SC versus EV groups, with the diagnostic apnea-hypopnea
      index of 34 events/h (IQR 21-59) versus 30 events/h (IQR 20-50) and Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale (ESS) 12.8 +/- 6 versus 11.7 +/- 5. At 2 months there was no
      significant difference in hours of CPAP usage SC: 3.45 h/night (95% CI: 2.76 to
      4.13) versus EV 3.75 h/night (95% CI: 3.14 to 4.37), nor proportion with adequate
      usage or overall commencement rate. However, at 12 months, there was a
      significant difference in hours of CPAP usage SC: 2.50 h/night (95% CI: 1.94 to
      3.06) versus EV 3.66 h/night (95% CI: 2.92 to 4.40). The probability of adequate 
      CPAP usage at 12 months was higher in the intervention arm OR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04 
      to 1.7, P = .013. Patients with low education backgrounds benefitted
      substantially from the EV intervention, compared to SC (mean difference at 12
      months = 2.47 h/night usage, 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.93, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Low
      health literacy designed educational videos improve CPAP adherence at 12 months, 
      compared with standard of care, with the greatest impact in patients with low
      educational background. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: Registry: Australian New

TI  - Use of smartphone photos to document the oral care status of nursing home
      residents.
LID - 10.1111/ger.12650 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether clinically assessed oral care status by an
      external dentist can be replicated using smartphone photographs. BACKGROUND: Many
      people with care needs have poor oral hygiene. To help maintain oral health,
      caregivers require a simple way of communicating oral care status to the dental
      team. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in which smartphone
      photographs of the oral and prosthetic care situation of N = 50 nursing-home
      patients (mean age 85.6 [SD 6] years, 74% women) were assessed by two blinded,
      external examiners (D1/D2) and compared with clinical assessments made by the
      onsite dentist who also took the photographs (D0). Intraoral care status was
      clinically evaluated using the modified Plaque Index for Long-Term Care (PI-LTC) 
      and Denture Hygiene Index (DHI). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)
      determined correlations between clinical and photographic findings. RESULTS: The 
      ICC was assessed for the PI-LTC (upper jaw, n = 41; lower jaw, n = 49) and DHI
      (upper jaw, n = 25; lower jaw, n = 18). The DHI showed excellent reliability
      between clinical assessment and smartphone evaluation for the determination of
      positive surfaces (ICC: upper 0.91 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.96], P < 
      0.001; lower 0.95 [95% CI 0.89-0.98], P < 0.001). The PI-LTC showed good
      reliability between clinical assessment (D0) and D1/D2 for determination of
      vestibular plaque (ICC: upper 0.84 [95% CI 0.74-0.91], P < 0.001; lower 0.87 [95%
      CI 0.79-0.92], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although limited, this pilot study
      demonstrated that standardised smartphone photographs can simply communicate the 
      intraoral care status of patients who have difficulties accessing their dentist. 
      This should be considered when planning improved communication between dentists, 
      care recipients, and their support network.

TI  - Attitudes of optometrists towards artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of
      retinal disease: A cross-sectional mail-out survey.
LID - 10.1111/opo.13034 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems have demonstrated great
      potential in improving the diagnostic accuracy of retinal disease but are yet to 
      achieve widespread acceptance in routine clinical practice. Clinician attitudes
      are known to influence implementation. Therefore, this study aimed to identify
      optometrists' attitudes towards the use of AI to assist in diagnosing retinal
      disease. METHODS: A paper-based survey was designed to assess general attitudes
      towards AI in diagnosing retinal disease and motivators/barriers for future use. 
      Two clinical scenarios for using AI were evaluated: (1) at the point of care to
      obtain a diagnostic recommendation, versus (2) after the consultation to provide 
      a second opinion. Relationships between participant characteristics and attitudes
      towards AI were explored. The survey was mailed to 252 randomly selected
      practising optometrists across Australia, with repeat mail-outs to
      non-respondents. RESULTS: The response rate was 53% (133/252). Respondents' mean 
      (SD) age was 42.7 (13.3) years, and 44.4% (59/133) identified as female, whilst
      1.5% (2/133) identified as gender diverse. The mean number of years practising in
      primary eye care was 18.8 (13.2) years with 64.7% (86/133) working in an
      independently owned practice. On average, responding optometrists reported
      positive attitudes (mean score 4.0 out of 5, SD 0.8) towards using AI as a tool
      to aid the diagnosis of retinal disease, and would be more likely to use AI if it
      is proven to increase patient access to healthcare (mean score 4.4 out of 5, SD
      0.6). Furthermore, optometrists expressed a statistically significant preference 
      for using AI after the consultation to provide a second opinion rather than
      during the consultation, at the point-of-care (+0.12, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Optometrists have positive attitudes towards the future use of AI as an aid to
      diagnose retinal disease. Understanding clinician attitudes and preferences for
      using AI may help maximise its clinical potential and ensure its successful
      translation into practice.

TI  - Intramedullary nailing for impending or pathologic fracture of the long bone:
      titanium vs carbon fiber peek nailing.
PG  - 611-617
LID - 10.1530/EOR-22-0001 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to compare titanium vs carbon fiber
      intramedullary (IM) nailing in terms of response to radiotherapy, local control
      of the disease, time of surgery, fluoroscopy exposure, and complications.
      Methods: From 2015 to 2021, 52 impending or pathologic fractures were treated
      with IM nailing in 47 patients: 18 males and 29 females with a mean age of 73.
      Titanium nails were used in 27 cases: femur (17 cases), humerus (8 cases), and
      tibia (2 cases). Carbon fiber nails were used in 25 cases: femur (17 cases),
      humerus (7 cases), and tibia (1 case). Results: At a mean follow-up of 8.4
      months, most patients died from the disease (63.4%). Fracture healing without
      osteolysis progression was present in 52% of titanium nailing at a mean time of 6
      months and in 53% of carbon fiber nails at a mean time of 4.6 months. No
      statistically significant difference has been shown in terms of healing (P =
      0.5), intraoperative fluoroscopy (P = 0.7), and time of surgery in femoral
      nailing (P = 0.6), while a significantly lower surgical time for carbon fiber
      humeral nailing (P = 0.01) was found. Two breakages of carbon fiber femoral nails
      were observed, and both were treated with revision with modular tumor
      megaprosthesis. Conclusions: Our results suggest that surgical time and
      fluoroscopy exposure are not longer for carbon fiber nails compared to titanium
      ones. Healing seems to be faster in carbon fiber nails. Further clinical studies 
      are needed to clarify the long-term outcomes of these implants.

TI  - Acute kidney injury and its association with mortality in Asian COVID-19
      patients: A meta-analysis.
LID - 10.5414/CN110899 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous evidence suggests that acute kidney injury (AKI) is common
      in patients with COVID-19 and associated with adverse outcomes. Moreover, the
      incidence and mortality of AKI in Asia are ambiguous. OBJECTIVE: Evaluating the
      risk factors and risk of death from AKI in COVID-19 patients in Asia. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of clinical observational studies of
      COVID-19 patients in Asia. Outcome measures included: AKI in COVID-19 patients,
      overall mortality in COVID-19 patients, and mortality assessment in patients with
      AKI. The random-effects model was adopted, with heterogeneity and sensitivity
      analysis. RESULTS: 27 clinical studies (18,216 Asian patients with COVID-19) have
      been included in the study. The pooled incidence of AKI was 0.19 (95% CI 16 -
      23%; I2 = 98.9%, p < 0.001); the pooled incidence of total mortality was 0.19
      (95% CI 17 - 22%; I2 = 98.9%, p < 0.001). No publication bias was found (Egger's 
      test, p = 0.396, 0.213). The pooled mortality in AKI patients with COVID-19 was
      50% (95% CI 33 - 67%; I2 by random-effects model = 98.4%, p < 0.001). AKI was
      found to be a risk factor for death in stepwise regression analysis; age,
      diabetes, and hypertension were influencing factors for AKI risk in COVID-19
      patients. CONCLUSION: AKI is a common complication in Asian COVID-19 patients,
      and it is associated with an increase in mortality of Asian COVID-19 patients.
      Any treatment that protects the kidney may be a practical intervention to reduce 
      the mortality of COVID-19 patients in Asia.

TI  - Pre-dialysis levels of inflammation and endotoxin in people receiving
      hemodialysis are not associated with blood pressure variability.
LID - 10.5414/CN110656 [doi]
AB  - There are multiple risk factors for inflammation in dialysis. One potential cause
      is the presence of circulating levels of Gram-negative bacteria-derived endotoxin
      which is a strong inducer of inflammation. Gut-associated endotoxin may enter the
      circulation via a defective blood-gut barrier during episodes of hypotension or
      reduced perfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 165 patients receiving
      outpatient-based hemodialysis in a facility (FHD) or at home (HHD), were studied.
      Levels of inflammation were quantified by developing an inflammatory score
      derived from the measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and
      interleukin 6 (IL-6). Intradialytic blood pressure (BP) variability and
      hypotension events were recorded. This included the final session of dialysis, at
      the commencement of which the blood samples were drawn, as well as the five
      preceding sessions. RESULTS: The median inflammatory score was 2 (range 0 - 3),
      and 30% of patients had an inflammatory score of three suggesting significant
      levels of inflammation. Only 8.5% had an inflammatory score of 0. Endotoxin was
      measured in all participants and was only positive in N = 3. The mean systolic
      blood pressure (SBP) was 134 +/- 20 mmHg and the BP variability was 11.7 +/- 3.5.
      In a multivariable ordinal regression model, a higher inflammatory score was
      significantly associated with younger age (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.95 - 0.99, p =
      0.03), higher ultrafiltration volume (OR 1.62, CI 1.04 - 2.54, p = 0.03) and
      lower body mass index (OR 0.9, CI 0.86 - 0.96, p = 0.01). There was no
      association between inflammatory score and dialysis modality, access type, kidney
      replacement therapy (KRT), BP variability, or endotoxin. Endotoxin was detected
      in only 3 of 165 patients and was not associated with inflammation. CONCLUSION:
      Pre-dialysis levels of inflammation are prevalent in the hemodialysis population 
      after the long break but are not related to intradialytic BP variability or
      hypotension in the preceding 2 weeks. However, endotoxemia is uncommon and
      unlikely to be a significant driver of inflammation.

TI  - Search for nutritional and inflammatory marker ratios to predict neutropenia in
      FEC therapy for breast cancer: A retrospective observational study.
LID - 10.5414/CP204264 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nutritional and inflammatory marker ratios are known to predict
      response to chemotherapy in breast cancer, but whether they predict adverse
      effects caused by chemotherapy remains unclear. We investigated whether
      nutritional and inflammatory marker ratios before starting FEC therapy
      (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide) predict grade 4 neutropenia as
      a serious adverse effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 61 patients with breast cancer
      who started FEC therapy for the first time as preoperative or postoperative
      chemotherapy were studied. Relevant nutritional and inflammatory marker ratios
      were compared between patients who developed grade 4 neutropenia (n = 44) and
      those who did not (n = 17). RESULTS: In univariate analysis, occurrence of
      neutropenia was related significantly (p < 0.05) to pre-FEC-therapy white blood
      cell count, platelet count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR),
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and
      modified Glasgow prognostic score. Analysis using cutoff values obtained from
      receiver operating characteristic curves showed that LMR, NLR, and PLR predicted 
      grade 4 neutropenia. However, multivariate logistic regression analysis
      identified no independent factor associated with grade 4 neutropenia. A post-hoc 
      power analysis revealed an inadequate sample size. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory
      marker ratios, especially PLR, may predict grade 4 neutropenia caused by FEC
      therapy for breast cancer. Although multivariate analysis identified no
      independent predictive markers in this study due to inadequate sample size,
      further prospective large-scale research is needed to examine the usefulness of
      nutritional and inflammatory marker ratios for predicting adverse effects.

TI  - Incisional negative pressure wound therapy to reduce surgical-site infections in 
      major limb amputations: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 526-532
LID - 10.1530/EOR-22-0049 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) has shown
      effectiveness in the treatment of high-risk surgical wounds. Especially patients 
      with diabetes-induced peripheral arterial disease undergoing major limb
      amputation have a high intrinsic risk for post-surgical wound infections. While
      normal gauze wound dressings do not cause stimulation of microvasculature, iNPWT 
      might improve wound healing and reduce wound complications. The purpose of this
      study was to systematically review the literature for rates of wound
      complications and readmissions, as well as post-surgical 30-day mortality.
      Methods: We conducted a systematic review searching the Cochrane, PubMed, and
      Ovid databases. Inclusion criteria were the modified Coleman methodology Score
      >60, non-traumatic major limb amputation, and adult patients. Traumatic
      amputations and animal studies were excluded. Relevant articles were reviewed
      independently by referring to the title and abstract. In a meta-analysis, we
      compared 3 studies and 457 patients. Results: A significantly overall lower rate 
      of postoperative complications is associated with usage of iNPWT (odds ratio (OR)
      = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.30-0.89; P = 0.02). There was no significant improvement for
      30-day mortality, when iNPWT was used (OR= 081; 95% CI: 0.46 - 1.45; P = 0.48).
      Nevertheless, we did not note a significant difference in the readmission rate or
      revision surgery between the two groups. Conclusion: Overall, the usage of iNPWT 
      may reduce the risk of postoperative wound complications in major lower limb
      amputations but does not improve 30-day mortality rates significantly. However,
      to anticipate surgical-site infection, iNPWT has shown effectiveness and thus
      should be used whenever applicable.

TI  - High prevalence of sarcopenia in Asian female patients awaiting primary total
      knee arthroplasty: Application of updated diagnostic tools from the Asian working
      group for sarcopenia.
PG  - 10225536221113034
LID - 10.1177/10225536221113034 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sarcopenia, a loss of muscle mass and strength with aging, is
      associated with various TKA-related complications. In 2020, the AWGS published an
      undated guideline (AWGS 2019) based on studies from East and Southeast Asia. The 
      purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia in Asian
      female patients awaiting primary total knee arthroplasty due to advanced knee
      osteoarthritis using the updated AWGS criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      present study included 138 female patients who scheduled for primary TKA with
      severe osteoarthritis. The included patients were assessed with use of an AWGS
      2019 diagnostic criteria based on muscle strength, physical performance, and
      appendicular skeletal muscle mass. Clinical parameters related to sarcopenia were
      collected and knee status assessed using the Knee Society scoring system. To
      better define the association with age, patients were stratified into following
      four groups: <60, 60-69, 70-79, >/=80. The prevalence of sarcopenia was
      identified, and the association between sarcopenia and clinical variables was
      analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia in this
      cohort according to the updated AWGS criteria was 35.5% and 21.7%. Prevalence of 
      sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia significantly increased with advancing age (p = 
      .003, p = .040, respectively). Although not statistically significant, the
      proportion of severe sarcopenia among sarcopenia also increased with age.
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lower BMI and lower
      25-OH-vitamin D3 level were independent risk factors associated with sarcopenia
      in women awaiting TKA. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study confirmed that
      sarcopenia is more prominent amongst female patients awaiting primary TKA than
      the general population. Therefore, orthopedic surgeons should consider sarcopenia
      prevention and intervention in this group. Further studies are needed to
      investigate the effect of TKA on sarcopenia, and the difference of TKA outcomes
      between groups with or without underlying sarcopenia.

      survey among healthcare workers, older adults and chronic disease patients.
LID - 10.1080/14760584.2022.2110074 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: : 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV-23) is crucial 
      to protecting high-risk groups. This study aimed to investigate the influencing
      factors of PPSV-23 recommendation among healthcare workers, and PPSV-23 coverage 
      among Chinese older adults and chronic disease patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: : In 2019, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted in ten
      provinces in China among older adults aged >/=65 years, chronic disease patients 
      aged 18-64 years, and primary healthcare workers. Multiple logistic regression
      model was adopted to identify the influencing factors of PPSV-23 recommendation
      and vaccination uptake. RESULTS: : Of the 1138 healthcare workers, 46.75% often
      recommended PPSV-23 to target groups, and public health workers were more likely 
      to recommend than general practitioners. PPSV-23 vaccination rate was 3.29% among
      chronic disease patients aged <65 years, 6.69% among older adults without chronic
      disease(s), and 8.87% among chronic disease patients aged >/=65 years. Multiple
      logistic regression revealed that only general practitioners' recommendation was 
      associated with increased PPSV-23 coverage (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: : The
      findings highlighted the suboptimal PPSV-23 coverage rate in China and the strong
      association between healthcare workers' recommendation and residents' vaccination
      uptake. Targeted and coherent PPSV-23-related training is suggested for general
      practitioners to encourage effective health promotion in clinical practices.

TI  - Health sciences students' perception of the communicative impacts of face
      coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic at a South African University.
PG  - e1-e14
LID - 10.4102/sajcd.v69i2.890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of face masks and/or shields can pose a challenge during
      communication. They block facial expressions thus removing visual cues and affect
      sound transmission making it difficult to hear speech clearly. Given the
      widespread use of face coverings, it seems reasonable to clarify if communication
      in typical speakers and listeners has significantly differed. Health science
      students as future practitioners need to understand challenges that arise from
      using face coverings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine health sciences
      students' perception of the communicative impacts of face coverings. METHOD: The 
      study employed a descriptive, self-administered online survey, obtaining
      information from 96 health science undergraduate students. RESULTS: All
      participants changed their manner of speaking in that they spoke louder when
      wearing masks and focused more on eye contact when someone was wearing masks.
      These were statistically significant (p = 0.450 and p = 0.035 respectively).
      Fifty-three percent reported using more listening effort and feeling anxious when
      communicating. Approximately 33% indicated that it was challenging to read
      emotions, such as sad or unhappy, when someone wore a mask. Most, 61%, were
      positive or very positive about wearing masks. The level of difficulty differed
      depending on the listening environment. It was harder to understand the doctor,
      nurse, or other healthcare workers when they wore face coverings than when
      listening to their friends and family, which had little effect, this being
      statistically significant (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Challenges envisaged in
      practice included frequent communication breakdowns, inability to connect and
      build trust between patient and practitioner, and communicating in noisy
      environments. Coping strategies, future clinical and research implications were
      proposed, and limitations acknowledged.

LID - 10.1002/JPER.22-0213 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to compare a flapless
      technique of alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) to a flap technique, to determine 
      if preserving the periosteal blood supply would limit loss of crestal ridge width
      and height. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients were randomly assigned to
      receive ARP using either a flapless or flap technique. Sockets were grafted with 
      demineralized bone matrix and mineralized particulate allograft then covered with
      a barrier. Re-entry was performed at 4 months to obtain samples for histological 
      analysis and subsequent implant placement. RESULTS: Ridge width of the flapless
      group at the crest decreased from 8.3 +/- 1.3 mm to 7.0 +/- 1.9 mm for a mean
      loss of 1.3 +/- 0.9 mm (p < 0.05), whereas the flap group decreased from 8.5 +/- 
      1.5 mm to 7.5 +/- 1.5 mm for a mean loss of 1.0 +/- 1.1 mm (p < 0.05). The mean
      mid-buccal vertical change for the flap group was a loss of 0.9 +/- 1.3 mm (p <
      0.05) versus 0.5 +/- 0.9 mm (p < 0.05) for the flapless group. There was no
      statistically significant difference between the groups. Histologically, flapless
      ARP revealed more vital mineralized tissue (44 +/- 10%) compared to the flap
      group (p>0.05). In the flapless group, the occlusal soft tissue was significantly
      thicker than the flap group at the 4-month reentry (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      Crestal ridge width, height, and percentage of vital mineralized bone following
      treatment with a flapless ARP technique was not significantly different from a
      flap technique. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gastropod-associated nematodes have been previously studied and documented
      worldwide, with some species forming host-specific association as obligate
      parasites of molluscs while others form intermediate and temporary association.
      Philippinella moellendorffi from Imelda, Zamboanga Sibugay, Philippines, were
      collected, washed and maintained in the laboratory until death. Cadavers were
      placed on nutrient agar to allow nematode proliferation. Nematode pure culture
      was obtained using one gravid female for propagation. Morphology and molecular
      analyses (18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and D2-D3 expansion segments of 28S rDNA) were
      employed as diagnostic tools in identifying the nematode species isolated from P.
      moellendorffi. The newly isolated nematode was identified as Caenorhabditis
      brenneri, thus designated as C. brenneri strain IZSP from the Philippines. This
      is the first record of C. brenneri isolated from the terrestrial slug P.
      moellendorffi.

TI  - Simplified antibiotic treatment for paediatric osteoarticular infections achieved
      good outcomes.
LID - 10.1111/apa.16510 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Early diagnosis of osteoarticular infections (OAI) in children and effective
      treatment prevents complications. The objective of this study was to evaluate
      effectiveness and safety of shortened intravenous antibiotic treatment of OAI.
      Incidence, diagnostics, and pathogens of paediatric OAI were assessed. METHODS:
      This retrospective study included all paediatric OAI admissions to The Children's
      Hospital Iceland in 2006-2020. The treatment was evaluated by dividing the study 
      cohort into two groups. The simplified treatment group received intravenous
      antibiotics for less than seven days. The longer intravenous group received
      intravenous antibiotics for a minimum of seven days. RESULTS: In total, 205 cases
      of OAI were included: 106 osteomyelitis, 83 septic arthritis and 16 with both.
      Age standardized incidence was 17 per 100,000 children and decreased over the
      study period (p = 0.004). A pathogen was identified in 37% (75/205) of cases of
      which 65% (49/75) were Staphylococcus aureus and 12% (9/75) Kingella kingae.
      Simplified treatment was not associated with increased risk of complications.
      CONCLUSION: This study supports claims that simplified treatment for OAI is safe 
      and effective. Further simplification of treatment might be viable. For uncertain
      reasons the incidence of OAI was decreasing in Iceland, predominantly in young
      children.

LID - 10.3324/haematol.2022.281585 [doi]
AB  - Measurable residual disease (MRD) before hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
      is an independent established prognostic factor in patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). Several methods exist to evaluate the presence of residual
      leukemia cells, but how these are used best in combination is unclear. To examine
      how residual cytogenetic abnormalities and MRD testing by multiparameter flow
      cytometry (MFC) may refine risk assessment before HCT, we analyzed 506 adults
      with cytogenetically abnormal AML who underwent both routine karyotyping and MFC 
      MRD testing before receiving a first allograft while in morphologic remission.
      Testing for residual cytogenetic abnormalities and MFC MRD identified four groups
      of patients with differential relapse-free survival (RFS, hazard ratio [HR]=1.63 
      for Cytoabnormal/MFCnegative [P=0.01, n=63], HR=3.24 for Cytonormal/MFCpositive

TI  - Clinical and biological impact of ATP-binding cassette transporter activity in
      adult acute myeloid leukemia.
LID - 10.3324/haematol.2022.280676 [doi]
AB  - Chemotherapy resistance is the main cause of treatment failure in acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) and has been related to ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
      activity. However, the links between ABC activity, immunophenotype, and molecular
      AML parameters have been poorly evaluated. Moreover, the prognostic value of ABC 
      activity, when compared to new molecular markers, is unknown. Here we
      investigated the links between ABC activity, as evaluated by JC-1 +/-
      cyclosporine A (CsA) assay, and immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, molecular, and
      targeted next generation sequencing features in 361 AML patients. High ABC
      activity was found in 164 patients and was significantly associated with less
      proliferating disease, an immature immunophenotype (expression of CD34, HLA-DR,
      CD117, CD13), and gene mutations defining AML as belonging to secondary-type
      ontogenic groups. Low ABC activity was associated with more mature myeloid
      differentiation (CD34-, cyMPO+, CD15+, CD33+) or monocytic commitment (CD64+,
      CD4+weak, CD14+), with NPM1 mutations, KMT2A rearrangements, and core-binding
      factor gene fusions, hallmarks of the de novotype AML ontogeny. ABC activity was 
      one of the major factors we identified using a random forest model for early
      prediction of AML ontogeny. In the 230 patients evaluated at diagnosis and
      intensively treated, high ABC activity was a predictive factor for primary
      resistance, and in multivariate analysis including full molecular data, an
      independent factor for event-freesurvival (p=0.0370). JC-1 +/- CsA assay could be
      used at diagnosis to predict AML ontogeny and to complete prognosis evaluation in
      addition to new molecular markers.

TI  - Predictors of Septic Shock or Bacteremia in Children Experiencing Febrile
      Neutropenia Post-Chemotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is an early indicator of infection in
      oncology patients post-chemotherapy. We aimed to determine clinical predictors of
      septic shock and/or bacteremia in pediatric cancer patients experiencing FN and
      to create a model that classifies patients as low-risk for these outcomes.
      METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis with clinical data of a cohort of
      pediatric oncology patients admitted during July 2015 to September 2017 with FN. 
      One FN episode per patient was randomly selected. Statistical analyses include
      distribution analysis, hypothesis testing, and multivariate logistic regression
      to determine clinical feature association with outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 865 
      episodes of FN occurred in 429 subjects. In the 404 sampled episodes that were
      analyzed, 20.8% experienced outcomes of septic shock and/or bacteremia.
      Gram-negative bacteria count for 70% of bacteremias. Features with statistically 
      significant influence in predicting these outcomes were hematological malignancy 
      (P < .001), cancer relapse (P = .011), platelet count (P = .004), and age (P =
      .023). The multivariate logistic regression model achieves AUROC = 0.66 (95% CI
      0.56-0.76). The optimal classification threshold achieves sensitivity = 0.96,
      specificity = 0.33, PPV = 0.40, and NPV = 0.95. CONCLUSIONS: This model, based on
      simple clinical variables, can be used to identify patients at low-risk of septic
      shock and/or bacteremia. The model's NPV of 95% satisfies the priority to avoid
      discharging patients at high-risk for adverse infection outcomes. The model will 
      require further validation on a prospective population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to examine how public health policies influenced the
      dynamics of COVID-19 time-varying reproductive number (R t ) in South Carolina
      from February 26, 2020 to January 1, 2021. METHODS: COVID-19 case series (March
      6, 2020 - January 10, 2021) were shifted by 9 days to approximate the infection
      date. We analyzed the effects of state and county policies on R t using EpiEstim.
      We performed linear regression to evaluate if per-capita cumulative case count
      varies across counties with different population size. RESULTS: R t shifted from 
      2-3 in March to <1 during April and May. R t rose over the summer and stayed
      between 1.4 and 0.7. The introduction of statewide mask mandates was associated
      with a decline in R t (-15.3%; 95% CrI, -13.6%, -16.8%), and school re-opening,
      an increase by 12.3% (95% CrI, 10.1%, 14.4%). Less densely populated counties had
      higher attack rate (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The R t dynamics over time indicated
      that public health interventions substantially slowed COVID-19 transmission in
      South Carolina, while their relaxation may have promoted further transmission.
      Policies encouraging people to stay home, such as closing non-essential
      businesses, were associated with R t reduction, while policies that encouraged
      more movement, such as re-opening schools, were associated with R t increase.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effect of nicotinamide
      phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) on abdominal aortic aneurysm by delaying the
      senescence of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). METHODS: The primary
      VSMC cells from normal and patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm were cultured 
      by tissue adherence method. Cells were divided into normal human-derived VSMC
      group (Ctrl-VSMC group), abdominal aortic aneurysm patient-derived VSMC group
      (AAA-VSMC group), and angiotensin II (Ang II) in vitro abdominal aortic aneurysm 
      model group (Ang II-VSMC group, 100 nmol/L Ang II treated normal human-derived
      VSMC for 48 hours), Ang II + P7C3 group and AAA + P7C3 group after NAMPT agonist 
      P7C3 intervention (adding 5 mumol/L P7C3 on the basis of Ang II-VSMC group and
      AAA-VSMC group, respectively). Immunofluorescence staining was used to identify
      VSMC; cell proliferation-associated antigen Ki67 staining was used to detect cell
      proliferation; senescence associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) staining
      was used to detect cell senescence in each group; Western blotting was used to
      detect the protein expression levels of senescence-related proteins p21, p16 and 
      NAMPT in each group. RESULTS: Compared with the Ctrl-VSMC group, the positive
      rate of SA-beta-gal staining and the expression levels of senescence-related
      proteins p21 and p16 in the AAA-VSMC group and Ang II-VSMC group were
      significantly increased [SA-beta-gal staining positive rate: (74.1+/-4.4)%,
      (68.6+/-5.5)% vs. (36.8+/-10.3)%, p21/GAPDH: 0.61+/-0.07, 0.51+/-0.03 vs.
      0.31+/-0.03, p16/GAPDH: 0.77+/-0.03, 0.72+/-0.06 vs. 0.33+/-0.26, all P < 0.01]. 
      However, the expression of NAMPT was significantly decreased (NAMPT/GAPDH:
      0.88+/-0.07, 0.79+/-0.14 vs. 1.29+/-0.02, both P < 0.01). Compared with the Ang
      II-VSMC group, the positive rate of SA-beta-gal staining and the expressions
      levels of senescence-related proteins p21 and p16 in the Ang II + P7C3 group were
      significantly lower [SA-beta-gal staining positive rate: (49.1+/-3.2)% vs.
      (68.6+/-5.5)%, p21/GAPDH: 0.35+/-0.06 vs. 0.51+/-0.03, p16/GAPDH: 0.47+/-0.08 vs.
      0.72+/-0.06, all P < 0.05], while the expression of NAMPT was significantly
      increased (NAMPT/GAPDH: 1.15+/-0.06 vs. 0.79+/-0.14, P < 0.01). Compared with the
      AAA-VSMC group, the positive rate of SA-beta-gal staining and the expression
      levels of senescence-related proteins p21 and p16 in the AAA+P7C3 group were
      significantly lower [SA-beta-gal staining positive rate: (54.1+/-6.0)% vs.
      (74.1+/-4.4)%, p21/GAPDH: 0.38+/-0.02 vs. 0.61+/-0.07, p16/GAPDH: 0.50+/-0.13 vs.
      0.77+/-0.03, all P < 0.05], but the expression of NAMPT was significantly
      increased (NAMPT/GAPDH: 1.25+/-0.28 vs. 0.88+/-0.07, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      NAMPT agonist P7C3 can delay the senescence of VSMC and play a protective role in
      abdominal aortic aneurysm.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of tanshinone II A on myocardial remodeling in
      ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced heart failure of rodent model. METHODS: (1) In
      vivo, 30 SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation, heart failure and
      tanshinone II A treatment group, with 10 rats in each group. The I/R model was
      established by ligating the left coronary artery until ST segment elevation for
      30 minutes, then the ligation was removed for 2 hours as reperfusion. In the sham
      operation group, the rat chest was opened without artery ligation. Three days
      after model establishment, tanshinone II A (10 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneal 
      injected in tanshinone II A group for 9 weeks. In the other two groups, normal
      saline was administrated in the same way. The behavioral manifestations of the
      rats in each group were observed; hemodynamic indexes were evaluated; Masson
      staining was performed to observe the degree of myocardial fibrosis; enzyme
      linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the content of Galectin-3
      in myocardial tissue; quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
      reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expressions of collagen III, collagen
      I, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase
      (TIMP-1). (2) In vitro, rats primary cardiac fibroblasts were extracted and
      isolated, and divided into blank control group, angiotensin II group (7-10 mmol/L
      angiotensin II) and angiotensin II + tanshinone II A group (7-10 mmol/L
      angiotensin II + 5-10 mmol/L tanshinone II A). At 24 hours and 48 hours of
      culture, the cell proliferation in each group was detected by methyl thiazolyl
      tetrazolium (MTT); the expressions of collagen III, collagen I, MMP-2 and TIMP-1 
      were detected by qRT-PCR; the content of Galectin-3 in cardiac fibroblasts was
      detected by ELSIA. RESULTS: (1) In vivo, the rats' activity status, hair
      conformity and food intake were ranked from good to bad in order of sham
      operation group, tanshinone II A group and heart failure model group. Compared
      with the sham-operated group, the heart rate (HR) of the rats in the heart
      failure model group was significantly decreased and the heart function was
      significantly impaired. The mRNA and protein expression of collagen I, collagen
      III, TIMP-1 and Galectin-3 content were significantly increased, while the mRNA
      and protein expression of MMP-2 were significantly decreased. Compared with the
      heart failure model group, rats in the tanshinone II A group showed significantly
      higher HR and improved cardiac function, significantly lower mRNA expression of
      collagen I and collagen III, significantly lower mRNA and protein expression of
      TIMP-1 and Galectin-3, and significantly higher mRNA and protein expression of
      MMP-2, and the most obvious changes were in the 9th weeks of modeling [collagen I
      mRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 4.70+/-1.19 vs. 10.21+/-1.62, collagen III mRNA
      (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 3.03+/-0.46 vs. 13.84+/-1.93, TIMP-1 mRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)):
      1.90+/-0.19 vs. 4.55+/-0.43, TIMP-1/GAPDH: 0.33+/-0.04 vs. 0.67+/-0.05,
      Galectin-3 (ng/L): 489.93+/-79.30 vs. 821.72+/-94.09, MMP-2 mRNA
      (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 0.37+/-0.07 vs. 0.03+/-0.01, MMP-2/GAPDH: 0.69+/-0.09 vs.
      0.21+/-0.04, all P < 0.05]. Masson staining showed that myocardial tissue
      fibrosis was obvious in the heart failure group, and the degree of fibrosis in
      the tanshinone II A group was reduced. (2) In vitro, compared with the blank
      control group, the proliferation rate, collagen I, collagen III and TIMP-1
      expression and Galectin-3 content of myocardial fibroblasts were significantly
      increased, and MMP-2 expression was significantly decreased in the angiotensin
      group at 24 h and 48 h of culture. Compared with the angiotensin group, the
      proliferation rate of cardiac fibroblasts and the expression of collagen I,
      collagen III and TIMP-1 and the content of Galectin-3 were significantly
      decreased, and the expression of MMP-2 mRNA was significantly increased in the
      angiotensin + tanshinone II A group, and the most significant changes were at 48 
      hours of culture [proliferation rate: (57.0+/-3.7)% vs. (67.0+/-2.4)%, collagen I
      mRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 551.43+/-67.10 vs. 871.48+/-12.25, collagen III mRNA
      (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 233.76+/-18.73 vs. 385.51+/-31.35, TIMP-1 mRNA
      (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 238.69+/-17.37 vs. 351.84+/-26.17, Galectin-3 (ng/L):
      283.76+/-28.73 vs. 415.51+/-31.35, MMP-2 mRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 108.54+/-12.10 
      vs. 51.47+/-6.25, all P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Tanshinone II A can improve cardiac
      function, inhibit myocardial fibrosis and improve myocardial remodeling in rats
      with I/R-induced heart failure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the changes of intracranial pressure in intensive care unit
      (ICU) patients during the occurrence and evolution of delirium by using bedside
      ultrasound to measure the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) to evaluate
      intracranial pressure. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was
      conducted. Adult patients who developed delirium during hospitalization in the
      general ICU of Beihai People's Hospital from October 2020 to November 2021 were
      enrolled, and patients who did not have ultrasonographic ONSD records within 24
      hours after the diagnosis of delirium were excluded. The ONSD measured before
      delirium was recorded as ONSD0, the ONSD measured within 24 hours of the onset of
      delirium recorded as ONSD1, and the ONSD reexamined after ONSD1 recorded as
      ONSD2. Patients were divided into intracranial hypertension group (ONSD1 > 5 mm) 
      and normal intracranial pressure group (ONSD1 </= 5 mm) according to the size of 
      ONSD1. According to the outcome of delirium, the patients were divided into
      cured, improved, and non-improved groups. The reduction ratio of ONSD2 to ONSD1
      in the three groups were calculated and compared. Pearson correlation test was
      used to analyze the correlation between fluid balance and ONSD changes after
      delirium. RESULTS: There were 43 patients, including 40 cases in the intracranial
      hypertension group (the incidence rate was 93.0%), 3 cases in the normal
      intracranial pressure group, 23 cases were cured, 13 cases were improved, and 7
      cases were not improved. In the intracranial hypertension group, 11 cases had
      ONSD0 and ONSD1 records, and ONSD1 was significantly higher than ONSD0 [mm:
      5.88+/-0.61 vs. 5.34+/-0.57, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) -0.85 to -0.23, P = 
      0.003]. The reduction ratio of ONSD2 to ONSD1 in the cured group was
      significantly higher than that in the improved group and the non-improved group
      [(12.04+/-6.20)% vs. (5.68+/-4.10)%, (0.17+/-3.96)%; 95%CI were 2.37 to 10.33,
      6.41 to 17.31, P values were 0.003 and 0.000, respectively]. The correlation
      analysis showed that the reduction ratio of ONSD2 to ONSD1 was negatively
      correlated with fluid balance (r = -0.42, 95%CI was -0.66 to -0.10, P = 0.012).
      CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of intracranial hypertension in ICU delirium patients 
      is high. A more pronounced decrease in intracranial pressure predicts a better
      delirium outcome. Dynamic ONSD measurement can provide valuable information for
      the prevention and treatment of delirium.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) monitoring in
      evaluating the efficacy of early enteral nutrition (EN) in patients with acute
      pancreatitis (AP). METHODS: The clinical data were collected from the AP patients
      in department of criticle care medicine of Baoshan Branch of Huashan Hospital
      Affiliated to Fudan University from July 2020 to June 2021. The patients were
      divided into three groups according to their treatments: no gastrointestinal
      decompression with fasting group, gastrointestinal decompression with fasting
      group, gastrointestinal decompression with indwelling jejunal tube within 24
      hours group. The data of white blood cell (WBC), procalcitonin (PCT), serum
      amylase (AMY) and IAP were analyzed before and after treatment, the initiation
      time oral feeding were also analyzed. RESULTS: The decrease of WBC, PCT, AMY, and
      IAP in gastrointestinal decompression with indwelling jejunal tube within 24
      hours group were significantly greater than those in the other groups [WBC
      (x10(9)/L): -1.72+/-0.74 vs. -0.68+/-0.36, -1.23+/-86.97; PCT (mug/L):
      -3.14+/-5.19 vs. 0.06+/-0.48, -1.57+/-0.78; AMY (U): -148.43+/-75.89 vs.
      -74.85+/-78.84, -93.78+/-1.17; IAP (cmH2O, 1 cmH2O approximately 0.098 kPa):
      -4.82+/-1.66 vs. 0.36+/-1.32, -3.22+/-4.36, all P < 0.05]. There were no
      correlation between the changes of IAP and the changes of WBC, PCT or AMY in the 
      non-gastrointestinal decompression with fasting group and the gastrointestinal
      decompression with indwelling jejunal tube within 24 hours group (all P > 0.05). 
      The decreasing trend of IAP in patients with gastrointestinal decompression with 
      fasting group was positively correlated with the change of AMY (r = 0.65, P <
      0.001). The initiation time of oral feeding in gastrointestinal decompression
      with indwelling jejunal tube within 24 hours group was significantly shorter than
      that in the other groups (hours: 89.538 vs. 111.273, 109.714), the difference was
      statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IAP monitoring, as an
      emergency means of monitoring the efficacy of early EN in AP patients, has the
      advantages of simplicity, efficiency and rationality, which has a more objective 
      basis than the previous empirical treatment and open oral feeding.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare and analyze the clinical characteristics between acute
      fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) and the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low
      platelets (HELLP) syndrome. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. The
      clinical data of 13 cases with AFLP and 34 cases with HELLP syndrome were
      collected from three tertiary referral centers in Yunnan (the First Affiliated
      Hospital of Kunming Medical University, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming
      Medical University, and Yan'an Hospital of Kunming City) from January 2016 to
      December 2021. The patients were diagnosed to AFLP and HELLP syndrome according
      to the Swansea criteria and the Tennessee classification system. The general
      characteristics, clinical features, laboratory results within 24 hours after
      admission, complications, maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared to
      analysis the differences between the two groups. RESULTS: (1) Maternal
      characteristics: compared with HELLP syndrome group, AFLP group had lower body
      mass index (BMI) and blood pressure at admission (both P < 0.01). (2) Clinical
      features: the most common symptoms in AFLP patients were skin jaundice, abdominal
      pain, nausea and vomiting, edema. The main manifestations of patients with HELLP 
      syndrome were albuminuria, hypertension, edema, headache. Some patients had
      multiple symptoms concurrently. (3) Laboratory results: compared with HELLP
      syndrome group, the levels of platelet count (PLT), total bilirubin (TBil),
      direct bilirubin (DBil), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GGT), alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP), total bile acid (TBA), serum creatinine (SCr) and
      international standardized ratio (INR) in AFLP group were significantly increased
      within 24 hours after admission [PLT (x10(9)/L): 107.69+/-51.13
      vs.76.71+/-43.25,TBil (mumol/L): 121.60 (83.20, 170.00) vs.15.25 (7.22, 29.05),
      DBil (mumol/L): 86.50 (58.60, 104.00) vs. 4.30 (2.22,10.10), gamma-GGT (U/L):
      87.00 (37.00, 127.00) vs. 41.00 (19.00,64.42), ALP (U/L): 199.10 (109.00, 349.20)
      vs. 125.50 (90.50, 155.25), TBA (mumol/L): 51.50 (16.20, 117.40) vs. 4.15 (2.02, 
      6.95), SCr (mumol/L): 155.80 (129.00, 237.00) vs. 79.00 (65.43, 113.70), INR:
      1.28 (1.17, 1.63) vs. 0.94 (0.88, 1.08), all P < 0.05], prothrombin time (PT) was
      significantly prolonged [seconds: 16.10 (14.50, 19.20) vs. 12.40 (11.43, 13.40), 
      P < 0.05]. The level of blood glucose (GLU), fibrinogen (FIB) and the activity of
      antithrombin III (AT III) decreased significantly [GLU (mmol/L): 5.18+/-1.33 vs. 
      6.33+/-1.19, FIB (g/L): 1.96+/-1.46 vs. 3.81+/-1.58, AT III (%): 40.61+/-25.84
      vs. 66.39+/-24.11, all P < 0.05]; (4) Complications: compared with HELLP syndrome
      group, the incidence of patients with hypoglycemia [30.77% (4/13) vs. 0% (0/34)],
      acute liver failure [53.85% (7/13) vs. 5.88% (2/34)], acute renal insufficiency
      [69.23% (9/13) vs. 8.82% (3/34)], coagulopathy [76.92% (10/13) vs. 38.24%
      (13/34)], disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [53.85% (7/13) vs. 5.88%
      (2/34)], and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [53.85% (7/13) vs. 5.88% 
      (2/34)] were significantly higher in AFLP group (all P <0.05). (5) Maternal and
      neonatal outcome: all patients delivered after admission. The total length of
      hospital and intensive care unit stay were significantly longer in the AFLP group
      than in the HELLP syndrome group [days: 17.00 (11.00, 25.00) vs. 9.00 (7.00,
      12.00), 12.00 (4.00, 22.00) vs. 3.91 (0, 7.00), both P < 0.01]. Two AFLP patients
      died, including one due to intracranial venous thrombosis and one due to multiple
      organ failure and cardiopulmonary arrest. There were no deaths in the HELLP
      syndrome group. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in maternal
      characteristics, laboratory results and complications between AFLP and HELLP
      syndrome. TBil, gamma-GGT, SCr, FIB, INR and AT III activity may help to
      distinguish the two diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the guiding effect of peripheral perfusion index (PI) on
      fluid resuscitation in patients with septic shock. METHODS: Sixty-five patients
      with septic shock who were diagnosed according to relevant criteria of septic
      shock and admitted to the department of critical care medicine of the Affiliated 
      Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University from September 2017 to December 2020 were 
      included. Patients were divided into the conventional treatment group (30 cases) 
      and PI guidance group (35 cases) by random number method. Both groups of patients
      were treated with the bundle according to clinical guidelines. Sputum, urine and 
      blood were collected for pathogenic microorganism culture before the application 
      of antibiotics, and vasoactive drugs were given. Both groups need to achieve all 
      the following resuscitation goals within 6 hours: urine output > 0.5
      mLxkg(-1)xh(-1), mean arterial pressure (MAP) >/= 65 mmHg (1 mmHg approximately
      0.133 kPa), central venous pressure (CVP) was 8-12 mmHg, and central venous
      oxygen saturation (ScvO2) >/= 0.70. There was no further resuscitation in the
      conventional treatment group after the goals were achieved. In addition to these 
      four goals, the PI guidance group was expected to achieve PI >/= 1.4. Heart rate 
      (HR), CVP, MAP, ScvO2, blood lactic acid (Lac), the time of fluid negative
      balance, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and 28-day mortality between the two
      groups were compared before and after 6 hours of fluid resuscitation. RESULTS:
      Before fluid resuscitation, there were no statistically significant differences
      in all indicators between two groups. After 6 hours fluid resuscitation, the four
      treatment goals in PI guidance group were slightly lower than those of the
      conventional treatment group [HR (times/min): 96.5+/-12.1 vs. 97.7+/-7.9, MAP
      (mmHg): 83.2+/-6.2 vs. 82.1+/-7.5, ScvO2: 0.661+/-0.077 vs. 0.649+/-0.051, CVP
      (mmHg): 10.8+/-2.7 vs. 10.4+/-2.1], there were no statistically significant
      differences between the two groups (all P > 0.05); the Lac level of the PI
      guidance group after resuscitation was lower than that of the conventional
      treatment group, and the difference was statistically significant (mmol/L:
      4.8+/-1.3 vs. 5.9+/-1.4, P < 0.05); the duration of fluid negative balance in the
      PI guidance group was earlier than that in the conventional treatment group
      [days: 3.0 (2.0, 3.0) vs. 3.5 (3.0, 4.0), P < 0.05]. The ICU mortality and 28-day
      mortality in the PI guidance group were lower than those in the conventional
      treatment group [ICU mortality rate: 37.1% (13/35) vs. 50.0% (15/30), 28-day
      mortality rate: 57.1% (20/35) vs. 60.0% (18/30)], but the differences were not
      statistically significant (both P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The peripheral PI can be 
      used as an important indicator of fluid resuscitation in patients with septic
      shock. PI guiding fluid resuscitation in patients with septic shock can reduce
      Lac levels, shorten the duration of fluid negative balance and reduce the risk of
      fluid overload.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic value of proprotein convertase
      subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and blood lipid indexes in patients with sepsis. 
      METHODS: Patients with sepsis or septic shock who were >/= 18 years old and met
      the Sepsis-3.0 diagnostic criteria admitted to the department of critical care
      medicine of Binzhou Medical University Hospital from January to October 2021 were
      enrolled. Healthy adults at the same period were selected as healthy control
      group. Baseline characteristics, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation
      II (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were
      recorded. Venous blood samples were collected within 24 hours after diagnosis,
      and serum PCSK9 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 1,
      3 days and 5 days. Meanwhile, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride
      (TG) and lipoprotein A were detected. The differences of each index between
      sepsis group (28-day death group and survival group) and healthy control group
      were compared. Meanwhile, the indexes of patients with different severity and
      28-day prognosis in sepsis group were compared. Receiver operator characteristic 
      curve (ROC curve) was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of PCSK9 and blood
      lipid for the prognosis of sepsis. Multivariate Logistic regression was used to
      analyze the influencing factors for the prognosis of sepsis, and the Kaplan-Meier
      survival curve at 28th day was drawn. RESULTS: There were 50 patients in sepsis
      group (including 19 patients with sepsis, 31 patients with septic shock) and 27
      patients in healthy control group. In the sepsis group, 19 patients died and 31
      patients survived within 28 days. The serum PCSK9 in the sepsis group was
      significantly higher than that in the healthy control group [mug/L: 223.09
      (198.47, 250.82) vs. 188.00 (165.27, 214.90), P < 0.01], and HDL-C, LDL-C, TC and
      lipoprotein A were significantly lower than those in the healthy control group
      [HDL-C (mmol/L): 0.82+/-0.35 vs. 1.45+/-0.24, LDL-C (mmol/L): 1.53 (1.14, 2.47)
      vs. 2.89 (2.55, 3.19), TC (mmol/L): 2.03 (1.39, 2.84) vs. 4.24 (3.90, 4.71),
      lipoprotein A (g/L): 8.80 (5.66, 17.56) vs. 27.03 (14.79, 27.03), all P < 0.01]. 
      PCSK9 in the sepsis death group was higher than that in the survival group
      [mug/L: 249.58 (214.90, 315.77) vs. 207.01 (181.50, 244.95), P < 0.01], and the
      HDL-C, LDL-C and TC were lower than those in the survival group [HDL-C (mmol/L): 
      0.64+/-0.35 vs. 0.93+/-0.30, LDL-C (mmol/L): 1.32+/-0.64 vs. 2.08+/-0.94, TC
      (mmol/L): 1.39 (1.01, 2.23) vs. 2.69 (1.72, 3.81), all P < 0.01]. With the
      progression of the disease, the PCSK9 in the sepsis death group and the survival 
      group was significantly lower than that within 1 day of diagnosis (all P < 0.05).
      ROC curve analysis showed that PCSK9 had higher predictive value of 28-day death 
      than HDL-C, LDL-C, TC [area under ROC curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval
      (95%CI): 0.748 (0.611-0.885) vs. 0.710 (0.552-0.868), 0.721 (0.575-0.867), 0.702 
      (0.550-0.854)]. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that PCSK9 was
      an independent risk factor affecting the 28-day prognosis of sepsis (beta value
      was 1.014, P = 0.020). Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that when
      PCSK9 >/= 208.97 mug/L, with the increase of PCSK9, the 28-day survival rate of
      sepsis patients decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: PCSK9, HDL-C, LDL-C and TC 
      can all predict the 28-day prognosis of patients with sepsis. The prognostic
      value of PCSK9 is the highest. PCSK9 is an independent risk factor affecting the 
      prognosis of sepsis. In the early stage of the disease, PCSK9 may have a good
      predictive value for the prognosis of sepsis. When PCSK9 >/= 208.97 mug/L, the
      28-day survival rate decreased significantly.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics, risk factors and prognosis of
      early septic patients with bloodstream infection (BSI) in department of critical 
      care medicine of Ningxia Medical University General Hospital. METHODS: Patients
      with sepsis admitted to department of critical care medicine of Ningxia Medical
      University General Hospital from November 1, 2019 to August 31, 2021 were
      included in a prospective observational study. Blood samples were collected for
      culture within 24 hours of sepsis diagnosis. General information, laboratory test
      indicators and blood culture results within 24 hours of sepsis diagnosis were
      recorded. Patients were followed up and prognostic indicators [mechanical
      ventilation time, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and 28-day survival] 
      were observed. According to blood culture results, patients were divided into BSI
      group and non-BSI group. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis
      were performed on the general clinical characteristics of patients in the two
      groups to screen the risk factors of early BSI in septic patients. Receiver
      operator characteristic curve (ROC) was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of
      risk factors for early BSI in septic patients. RESULTS: A total of 202 septic
      patients were included in this study, with 62 patients in BSI group and 140
      patients in non-BSI group. The majority of patients in the BSI group were
      associated with abdominal infection (61.3%), and the majority of patients in the 
      non-BSI group were associated with pulmonary infection (49.3%). A total of 76
      strains were isolated from septic patients in BSI group, and the most common
      pathogens were Escherichia coli (26 strains, 34.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11
      strains, 14.4%), Enterococcus (7 strains, 9.2%), Bacteroides fragilis (6 strains,
      7.9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6 strains, 7.9%). There were no significant
      differences in mechanical ventilation time, the length of ICU stay and 28-day
      mortality between the BSI group and the non-BSI group. The difference of
      variables was statistically significant between two group according to Univariate
      analysis, which included body temperature, acute physiology and chronic health
      score II (APACHE II), use of antibiotics before admission to ICU, abdominal
      infection, hypersensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum creatinine (SCr), 
      total bilirubin (TBil), platelet count (PLT), blood lactic acid (Lac) and
      hypercalcitonin (PCT). Multivariate analysis showed that low PLT [odds ratio (OR)
      = 1.004, P = 0.019], high Lac (OR = 1.314, P = 0.002), high body temperature (OR 
      = 1.482, P = 0.027), concomitant abdominal infection (OR = 2.354, P = 0.040), no 
      use of antibiotics before admission to ICU (OR = 2.260, P = 0.049) were
      independent risk factors for early BSI in septic patients. The area under ROC
      curve (AUC) of PLT, Lac, body temperature, abdominal infection and no use of
      antibiotics before admission to ICU for predicting early BSI in septic patients
      were 0.711, 0.686, 0.594, 0.592 and 0.590, respectively. Youden index was used to
      calculate the optimal cut-off values, which was PLT 122.50x10(9)/L, Lac 2.95
      mmol/L, body temperature 39.45 centigrade, respectively. The highest level of AUC
      was 0.754, the PI guidance group was expected to achieve PI the sensitivity was
      75.8%, and the specificity was 68.8%, which were observed when the 5 items were
      combined. CONCLUSIONS: Early septic patients with BSI are more serious than those
      without BSI. Low PLT, high Lac, high temperature, concomitant abdominal infection
      and no use of antibiotics before admission to ICU are independent risk factors
      for early BSI in septic patients, and the combination of these five factors has
      good predictive value.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether signal transducer and activator of
      transcription (STAT1/3/5) have a protective effect on hyperoxia-induced acute
      lung injury (HALI) and its mechanism. METHODS: Seventy C57BL/6J mice were
      randomly divided into five groups: normoxia control group, HALI group, and
      STAT1/3/5 inhibitor groups, with 14 mice in each group. The HALI model was
      established by exposure to more than 90% hyperoxia for 48 hours; three STAT
      inhibitor groups were pretreated by intraperitoneal injection of STAT1 inhibitor 
      40 mg/kg and STAT3 inhibitor 5 mg/kg, and STAT5 inhibitor 10 mg/kg for 1 week.
      Six blood samples were randomly collected from each group, and microRNA-21
      (miR-21) expression was measured by quantitative real-time reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Lung tissue of the sacrificed
      mice was obtained, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to
      detect the contents of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukins
      (IL-6, IL-1beta), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonic dialdehyde (MDA), and
      matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). The water content of lung tissue was
      calculated. The pathological changes in lung tissue were observed under the light
      microscope, and the pathological score of lung injury was performed. Western
      blotting was used to detect the expression of phosphorylated STAT (p-STAT1,
      p-STAT3, p-STAT5) in lung tissue. The 7-day cumulative survival rates of the
      remaining 8 mice in each group were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. 
      RESULTS: Under the light microscope, the alveolar structures in the HALI group
      and the STAT1 inhibitor group were destroyed, a large number of neutrophils (NEU)
      infiltrated in the alveoli and lung interstitium, which were thickened. The
      pathological score of lung injury and the water content of the lung tissue was
      significantly increased. In STAT3 inhibitor and STAT5 inhibitor groups, the
      alveolar cavity was clear, the degree of NEU infiltration and the thickness of
      lung interstitium were lower than those in HALI group, the pathological score of 
      lung injury and the water content of lung tissue were significantly decreased,
      especially in STAT3 inhibitor group. Compared with the normoxia control group,
      the contents of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, MDA, and MMP9, and the expression
      levels of p-STAT3 and p-STAT5 in the HALI group were significantly increased. In 
      contrast, the content of SOD and the expression of miR-21 were significantly
      decreased. Compared with the HALI group, the contents of TNF-alpha, IL-6,
      IL-1beta, MDA, and MMP9 in the STAT3 inhibitor group and STAT5 inhibitor group
      were significantly decreased. At the same time, the content of SOD and the
      expression of miR-21 were significantly increased, especially in STAT3 inhibitor 
      group [TNF-alpha (mug/L): 42.53+/-3.25 vs. 86.36+/-5.48, IL-6 (ng/L):
      68.46+/-4.28 vs. 145.00+/-6.89, IL-1beta (mug/L): 28.74+/-3.53 vs. 68.00+/-5.64, 
      MDA (mumol/g): 20.33+/-2.74 vs. 42.58+/-3.45, and MMP9 (ng/L): 128.55+/-6.35 vs. 
      325.13+/-6.65, SOD (kU/g): 50.53+/-4.19 vs. 22.53+/-3.27, miR-21
      (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 0.550+/-0.018 vs. 0.316+/-0.037, all P < 0.05]. Kaplan-Meier 
      survival curve analysis showed that the 7-day cumulative survival rates of the
      STAT3 inhibitor group and STAT5 inhibitor group were significantly higher than
      those of the HALI group [62.5% (5/8), 37.5% (3/8) vs. 12.5% (1/8), both P <
      0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of STAT3 hyperactivation may suppress the
      inflammatory response, regulate oxidative stress, improve lung permeability
      through regulating the expression of miR-21, which exert lung protection in HALI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effect of Xiaoqinglong decoction on vascular endothelin
      (ET) in rats pulmonary hypertension (PAH) model based on the Jiebiaokuoluo
      method. METHODS: Sixty male SD rats were randomly divided into six groups:
      control group, PAH model group, positive drug group, and Xiaoqinglong decoction
      in the high-dose, medium-dose and low-dose groups, 10 rats in each group. The
      control group did not receive any treatment. The remaining groups were kept in
      low-pressure oxygen tanks, injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 200 muL on
      day 1 and day 14, respectively. The rats were smoked twice a day from day 2 to
      day 30 (except day 14) at 4 hours intervals. The rats were placed in a
      low-temperature environment for 1 hour per day, and were put into cold water to
      swim (for 2 weeks), while the rats were given a cold diet. After modeling, the
      control group and the PAH model group were given equal volumes of normal saline; 
      the positive drug group was given bosentan (100 mg/kg); Xiaoqinglong decoction
      15, 10 and 5 g/kg was given, respectively, in the high, medium and low dose
      groups; once daily for 30 days. The mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and
      right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP) were then measured with right heart
      catheterization and the right ventricle hypertrophy index (RVHI) was assessed;
      ET-1 and nitric oxide (NO) levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS:
      Compared with the control group, the levels of mPAP, RVSP, RVHI and ET-1 were
      significantly increased in the PAH model group [mPAP (mmHg, 1 mmHg approximately 
      0.133 kPa): 33.20+/-1.04 vs. 13.20+/-1.03, RVSP (mmHg): 62.40+/-1.54 vs.
      24.20+/-1.02, RVHI: 42.90+/-2.51 vs. 25.40+/-2.01, ET-1 (ng/L): 100.80+/-20.34
      vs. 81.50+/-13.84, all P < 0.05], while NO levels were significantly decreased
      (mmol/L: 23.20+/-1.81 vs. 31.70+/-1.49, P < 0.05). Compared with the PAH model
      group, the levels of mPAP, RVSP, RVHI and ET-1 in the positive drug group and
      high, medium, low dose groups of Xiaoqinglong decoction were significantly
      decreased [mPAP (mmHg): 25.50+/-0.84, 26.90+/-0.74, 27.10+/-1.19, 29.10+/-0.75
      vs. 33.20+/-1.04, RVSP (mmHg): 54.40+/-5.14, 50.10+/-1.67, 53.10+/-1.05,
      56.60+/-1.07 vs. 62.40+/-1.54, RVHI: 41.10+/-1.19, 31.20+/-1.67, 31.30+/-1.89,
      40.30+/-1.88 vs. 42.90+/-2.51, ET-1 (ng/L): 70.70+/-7.89, 69.90+/-2.92,
      71.70+/-4.32, 73.90+/-5.19 vs. 100.80+/-20.34, all P < 0.05], while NO levels
      were significantly increased (mmol/L: 32.50+/-2.06, 34.70+/-1.16, 32.70+/-1.33,
      30.10+/-1.19 vs. 23.20+/-1.81, all P < 0.05), and with the increased dose of
      Xiaoqinglong decoction, the change was more obvious, and the effect was better in
      the high-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: Xiaoqinglong decoction can reduce rats PAH by
      regulating ET-1 and NO levels in a dose-dependent manner.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influencing factors of endotracheal intubation and 
      mechanical ventilation (ETI-MV) in patients with acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) caused by viral pneumonia, and to provide evidence for
      individualized use of ETI-MV. METHODS: Patients with ARDS due to viral pneumonia 
      admitted to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) of the First Affiliated
      Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University were retrospectively analyzed from
      November 2017 to March 2022. The gender, age, concomitant diseases, clinical
      symptoms and signs, complications, lab results, ARDS severity, infectious virus
      type, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), respiratory 
      support methods and prognosis-related variables were collected. Univariate
      analysis was performed on each factor, and the variables with statistical
      significance in the univariate analysis were subjected multivariate logistic
      regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was 
      drawn to evaluate the predictive value of each index for the implementation of
      ETI-MV. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were enrolled in the study, including 61
      patients in the ETI-MV group, and 3 patients (4.9%), 39 patients (63.9%) and 19
      patients (31.1%) with mild, moderate and severe ARDS, respectively. There were 56
      patients in non-ETI-MV group, and the mild, moderate and severe ARDS cases were
      16 cases (28.6%), 38 cases (67.8%) and 2 cases (3.6%), respectively. There was
      significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). Univariate analysis
      showed that during 24 hours admitted to RICU, the levels of interleukin-6 [IL-6
      (ng/L): 104.0+/-90.0 vs. 62.4+/-76.0], oxygenation index [PaO2/FiO2 (mmHg, 1 mmHg
      approximately 0.133 kPa): 123.9+/-30.9 vs. 173.6+/-28.5], the proportion of cases
      with pulmonary infiltrating opacity distribution range >/= 3/4 lung fields [85.3%
      (52/61) vs. 21.5% (12/56)], APACHE II score >/= 16.5 [67.2% (41/61) vs. 42.9%
      (24/56)], the rate of nosocomial invasive aspergillus infection [14.8% (9/61) vs.
      3.6% (2/56)], the percentage of nosocomial bacterial infection [16.4% (10/61) vs.
      3.6% (2/56)], and the lowest CD4(+) T lymphocyte count in the course of the
      disease [cells/mm(3): 192.2+/-35.8 vs. 215.0+/-58.3] had significant differences 
      between ETI-MV and non-ETI-MV group (all P < 0.05). Multivariate Logistic
      regression analysis showed that during 24 hours admitted to RICU the distribution
      range of pulmonary infiltrating opacity >/= 3/4 the lung fields [odds ratio (OR) 
      = 12.527, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 3.279-47.859, P < 0.001], APACHE II
      score >/= 16.5 (OR = 30.604, 95%CI = 4.318-216.932, P = 0.001), PaO2/FiO2 (OR =
      0.948, 95%CI = 0.925-0.972, P < 0.001), CD4(+) T lymphocytes cell count (OR =
      0.975, 95%CI = 0.955-0.995, P = 0.015), and nosocomial bacterial infection (OR = 
      38.338, 95%CI = 1.638-897.158, P = 0.023) were independent risk factors for
      ETI-MV. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of ROC showed that PaO2/FiO2 had the
      greatest predictive value for ETI-MV, with AUC of 0.903, sensitivity of 91.1% and
      specificity of 95.1% in case of cutoff value of 151 mmHg. The AUC of pulmonary
      infiltrating opacity distribution range was 0.809, the sensitivity of 85.2%,
      specificity of 78.6% when the cutoff value was >/= 3/4 lung field. APACHE II
      scores had the lowest predictive value for selecting ETI-MV, with AUC of 0.704,
      sensitivity of 83.6% and specificity of 57.1% under the cutoff value was 16.5.
      CONCLUSIONS: For patients with ARDS caused by viral pneumonia, PaO2/FiO2 is still
      the classic reference for selecting ETI-MV, however, the distribution range of
      pulmonary infiltrating opacity and the systemic severity of the disease during 24
      hours admitted to the RICU may provide supplemental helpful information to
      determine whether the patients choose ETI-MV, especially for moderate ARDS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the changes of clinical characteristics and immune-related 
      indicators of patients with mild and moderate acute Omicron variant infection,
      and to evaluate the protective effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      vaccination. METHODS: The study retrospectively analyzed the clinical
      characteristics of 317 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 Omicron variant
      (B1.1.529) infection admitted to Tianjin First Central Hospital (Shuixi District)
      from January 22, 2022 to February 24, 2022. Demographic characteristics,
      vaccination status, underlying diseases, epidemiological characteristics,
      baseline data, and relevant laboratory test results on admission were collected, 
      and the differences in clinical characteristics, especially the changes in
      immune-related indicators, between mild and moderate patients were compared and
      analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 317 adult patients with acute Omicron variant
      infection, the proportion of elderly, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular 
      or cerebrovascular diseases were significantly higher in moderate group (203
      cases) than those of mild group (114 cases) [age >/= 60 years old: 27.58%
      (56/203) vs. 9.65% (11/114), hypertension: 31.03% (63/203) vs. 19.30% (22/114),
      diabetes: 15.76% (32/203) vs. 7.89% (9/114), cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      diseases: 11.33% (23/203) vs 0.88% (1/114), all P < 0.05]. The route of
      transmission was mainly through gatherings and the first symptoms were fever, dry
      cough, fatigue, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose and other flu symptoms;
      19.30% (22/114) and 24.63% (50/203) of patients in mild and moderate groups were 
      positive for the new coronavirus nucleic acid test, respectively, but the
      difference was not significant difference (P > 0.05). Inflammatory indicators in 
      most mild and moderate patients were within normal range, such as white blood
      cell count (WBC), neutrophil ratio (NEU%), lymphocyte count (LYM), C-reactive
      protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), etc., suggesting
      that the acute phase of Omicron variant infection had not yet caused severe
      inflammatory storm, which might be related to the weakening of pathogenicity
      after vaccination and virus mutation. The proportion of patients with IL-6 > 7
      ng/L in the mild group was significantly lower than that in the normal group
      [1.75% (2/114) vs. 6.40% (13/203), P < 0.05], suggesting that elevated IL-6 might
      be an important factor in evaluating indicators of disease severity. There was no
      significant difference in lymphocyte subsets between the two groups, but there
      were 12.90% (12/93) and 11.04% (17/154) of the patients in two groups,
      respectively, decreased in the proportion of helper T cells, and 18.28% (17/93)
      and 14.28% (22/154) of the patients had elevated CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, suggesting 
      that patients with Omicron variant infection had autoimmune system dysfunction,
      which might be related to disease progression and the occurrence of long-term
      autoimmune disease. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-6 level may be used as a predictor for 
      evaluating the severity of disease in patients with Omicron variant infection;
      after vaccination, inflammatory indicators in patients with acute Omicron variant
      infection were significantly reduced, but the long-term effects still require
      long-term follow-up observation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effect of awake prone positioning (APP) for
      common coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Omicron variant. METHODS:
      Retrospectively analyze the clinical data of patients with COVID-19 caused by
      Omicron variant admitted by medical team of Tianjin Third Central Hospital during
      the period of supporting Tianjin COVID-19 designated hospital from January 8 to
      February 20, 2022. Patients who met the diagnostic criteria for common COVID-19
      and had risk factors for developing severe disease or had pulse oxygen saturation
      (SpO2) </= 0.93 after exercise without supplementary oxygen were enrolled.
      Patients were divided into APP group and control group according to whether they 
      completed the daily 12-hours APP in the first three days after enrollment.
      Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, COVID-19 vaccination status,
      laboratory examination, disease progression (progression to severe), time to
      nucleic acid negative conversion, length of hospital stay, and adverse reactions 
      and tolerability [visual analog scale (VAS) score (the higher the score, the
      worse the tolerability] during APP were evaluated in two groups. Interleukin-6
      (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), SpO2/inhaled oxygen concentration (FiO2) ratio 
      and ROX index (ROXI) were compared between two groups at enrollment, 3rd and 7th 
      day after enrollment. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in
      demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, vaccination rates of COVID-19 and
      laboratory tests between the two groups. There were no statistically significant 
      differences in IL-6, CRP, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI between two groups at the time
      of enrollment. Compared with the group at the time of enrollment, SpO2/FiO2 ratio
      and ROXI in APP group increased significantly at the 3rd day after enrollment
      [SpO2/FiO2 ratio: 461.90 (457.10, 466.70) vs. 446.67 (437.14, 457.10), ROXI:
      25.40 (23.33, 25.93) vs. 22.57 (21.86, 24.40), all P < 0.05], and the levels of
      IL-6 and CRP in control group were significantly increased [IL-6 (ng/L): 18.30
      (6.50, 37.75) vs. 7.40 (5.10, 11.15), CRP (mg/L): 11.46 (2.11, 17.96) vs. 4.11
      (1.72, 9.05), all P < 0.05]. At the 3rd day of enrollment, the levels of IL-6 and
      CRP in APP group were significantly lower than those in control group [IL-6
      (ng/L): 7.35 (4.35, 12.80) vs. 18.30 (6.50, 37.75), CRP (mg/L): 4.52 (1.98, 9.66)
      vs. 11.46 (2.11, 17.96), all P < 0.05], while SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI were
      significantly higher than those in control group [SpO2/FiO2 ratio: 461.90
      (457.10, 466.70) vs. 446.67 (441.90, 459.52), ROXI: 25.40 (23.33, 25.93) vs.
      23.31 (22.10, 24.66), all P < 0.05]. At the 7th day of enrollment,there were no
      significant differences in IL-6, CRP, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI between two
      groups. There were no severe cases in both groups. The time of nucleic acid
      negative conversion and length of hospital stay in APP group were significantly
      shorter than those in control group [10.0 (8.0, 12.0) days vs. 11.0 (9.0, 13.0)
      days, 12.0 (10.0, 14.0) days vs. 14.0 (12.0,16.0) days, respectively, all P <
      0.05]. The main adverse reaction during APP was back pain, and the incidence in
      APP group was slightly lower than that in control group, but the difference was
      not statistically significant [17.9% (17/95) vs. 26.5% (27/102), P = 0.149]. VAS 
      score in control group was significantly higher than that in APP group [score:
      2.5 (2.0, 4.0) vs. 2.0 (1.0, 3.0), P = 0.004]. CONCLUSIONS: In common COVID-19
      patients caused by Omicron variant with high risk factors for progression to
      severe disease or decreased oxygen reserve capacity, early APP can shorten the
      time of nucleic acid negative conversion and the length of hospital stay, but its
      effect on preventing disease progression cannot be determined.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients inoculated with
      different vaccines and underlying diseases, infected with the novel coronavirus
      Omicron variant. METHODS: The data of 430 patients infected with the novel
      coronavirus Omicron variant who were admitted to Tianjin First Center Hospital
      from January 21, 2022 to March 7, 2022 were collected. A total of 108 patients
      with Omicron variant infection with underlying diseases were selected and
      enrolled. The gender, age, body mass index (BMI), history of underlying diseases,
      vaccination status (vaccination times, vaccination type), clinical symptoms,
      laboratory test indicators, imaging data, hospitalization time, nucleic acid
      negative conversion time, re-positivity and antibody titer from the two groups of
      the patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In the 108 patients, 93 cases 
      received inactivated vaccine and 15 cases received adenovirus vaccine. There was 
      no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of
      gender, age, BMI, disease types, whether completed the fully vaccinated, whether 
      had prime boost and underlying diseases. Both groups had fever, dry cough, sore
      throat, runny nose and other clinical symptoms, but there were no statistical
      difference between the two groups. There were no statistically significant
      differences in laboratory blood routine tests, biochemical indexes, C-reactive
      protein (CRP) level and the results of chest computed tomography (CT) imaging
      between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in
      hospitalization days, nucleic acid negative conversion time, whether admission to
      intensive care unit (ICU), turn re-positive on nucleic acid tests and
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody titer expression between the two groups, but
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titer in adenovirus group was higher than that in
      inactivated group (g/L: 229.67+/-26.13 vs. 194.33+/-61.56, P = 0.020). There were
      also no significant differences in laboratory examinations, hospitalization days,
      nucleic acid negative conversion time, turn re-positive on nucleic acid tests and
      Novel coronavirus antibody titers expression of the patients with booster shots
      between the inactivated vaccine group and the adenovirus vaccine group.
      CONCLUSIONS: The protection of inactivated virus vaccine is equivalent to
      adenovirus vaccine in patients with underlying disease Omicron variant infection,
      and the titer of IgG antibody in patients with adenovirus vaccine is higher than 
      that in patients with inactivated virus vaccine after one week of recovery.

      herbivore's parasitic wasp, Trichogramma chilonis, an important biocontrol agent.
      What happens to this trophic system when heat stress challenges this
      agro-ecosystem? We studied how high temperature (HT) pre-treatments influence
      potato's VOC emissions and their subsequent effects on the preferences of
      insects, as evaluated in oviposition assays and Y-tube olfactometers. HT
      pre-stressed plants were less attractive to P. operculella adult moths, which
      were repelled by HT VOCs, but increased the recruitment of the parasitoid, T.
      chilonis, which were attracted. VOC emissions, including the most abundant
      constituent, ss-caryophyllene, were enhanced by HT treatments; some constituents 
      elicited stronger behavioral responses than others. Transcripts of many genes in 
      the biosynthetic pathways of these VOCs were significantly enhanced by HT
      treatment, suggesting increases in de novo biosynthesis. HT increased the plant's
      stomatal apertures, and exogenous applications of the hormone, ABA, known to
      suppress stomatal apertures, reduced leaf volatile emissions and affected the
      HT-altered plant attractions to both insects. From these results, we infer that
      HT stress affects this plant-insect interaction through its influence on VOC
      emissions, potentially decreasing herbivore ovipositions while increasing
      ovipositions of the parasitoid. This article is protected by copyright. All

TI  - ECG-I Phenotyping of Persistent AF Based on Driver Burden and Distribution to
      Predict Response to Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PHENOTYPE-AF).
LID - 10.1111/jce.15644 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This prospective trial sought to phenotype persistent AF based on AF 
      mechanisms using ECGI mapping to determine whether this would predict long term
      freedom from arrhythmia after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). METHODS: Patients
      with persistent AF of < 2 years duration underwent cryoballoon PVI. ECGI mapping 
      was performed prior to PVI to determine potential drivers (PDs) defined as
      rotational activations completing >/= 1.5 revolutions or focal activations. The
      co-primary end point was the association between (1) PD burden (defined as the
      number of PD occurrences) and (2) PD distribution (defined as the number of
      segments on an 18 segment model of the atria harbouring PDs) with freedom from
      arrhythmia at 1 year follow up. RESULTS: Of 100 patients, 97 completed follow up 
      and 52 (53.6%) remained in sinus rhythm off antiarrhythmic drugs. Neither PD
      burden nor PD distribution predicted freedom from arrhythmia (HR 1.01, 95% CI
      0.99 - 1.03, p = 0.164; and HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 - 1.17, p = 0.591 respectively).
      Otherwise, the burden of rotational PDs, rotational stability, and the burden of 
      PDs occurring at the pulmonary veins and posterior wall all failed to predict
      arrhythmia recurrence (all p > 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: AF mechanisms as determined
      using ECGI mapping do not predict outcome after PVI for persistent AF. Further
      studies using different methodologies to characterise AF mechanisms are
      warranted. (NCT03394404) This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Mosaicism of common pathogenic MECP2 variants identified in two males with a
      clinical diagnosis of Rett syndrome.
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.62913 [doi]
AB  - Rett (RTT) syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variation
      in the MECP2 gene, is characterized by developmental regression, loss of
      purposeful hand movements, stereotypic hand movements, abnormal gait, and loss of
      spoken language. Due to the X-linked inheritance pattern, RTT is typically
      limited to females. Recent studies revealed somatic mosaicism in MECP2 in male
      patients with RTT-like phenotypes. While detecting mosaic variation using Sanger 
      sequencing is theoretically possible for mosaicism over ~15%-20%, several
      variables, including efficiency of PCR, background noise, and/or human error,
      contribute to a low detection rate using this technology. Mosaic variants in two 
      males were detected by next generation sequencing (NGS; Case 1) and by Sanger
      re-sequencing (Case 2). Both had targeted digital PCR (dPCR) to confirm the
      variants. In this report, we present two males with classic RTT syndrome in whom 
      we identified pathogenic variation in the MECP2 gene in the mosaic state (c.730C 
      > T (p.Gln244*) in Patient 1 and c.397C > T (p.Arg133Cys) in Patient 2). In
      addition, estimates and measures of mosaic variant fraction were surprisingly
      similar between Sanger sequencing, NGS, and dPCR. The mosaic state of these
      variants contributed to a lengthy diagnostic odyssey for these patients. While
      NGS and even Sanger sequencing may be viable methods of detecting mosaic
      variation in DNA or RNA samples, applying targeted dPCR to supplement these
      sequencing technologies would provide confirmation of somatic mosaicism and
      mosaic fraction.

TI  - The advantage of mini electrode-equipped catheter for the radiofrequency ablation
      of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
LID - 10.1111/jce.15639 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Novel ablation catheters equipped with mini-electrodes (ME) offer
      high resolution mapping for target tissue. This study aimed to evaluate the
      mapping performance and efficacy of ME catheters in radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
      of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVTs). METHODS: We prospectively
      enrolled 136 patients undergoing RFA of PSVT including 76 patients with
      atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and 60 patients with
      atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) or Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW)
      syndrome. Patients were randomized to the ME group (ablation using ME catheters) 
      or the control group (ablation using conventional catheters). The number of
      ablation attempt and cumulative ablation time to ablation endpoints, which was
      defined as an emergence of junctional rhythm in AVNRT or accessory pathway (AP)
      block in AVRT/WPW syndromes were compared. RESULTS: During ablation procedures,
      discrete slow pathway or AP electrograms were found in 27 (39.7%) patients in the
      ME group and 13 (19.1%) patients in the control group. The primary study outcomes
      were significantly lower in the ME group (ablation attempt number: 2.0 [1-4] vs. 
      3.0 [2-7] in the ME and control group, p=0.032; ablation time: 23.5 [5.0-111.5]
      vs. 64.5 [16.0-185.0] seconds, p=0.013). According to the PSVT diagnosis,
      ablation time to junctional rhythm was significantly shorter in the ME group in
      AVNRT. In AVRT/WPW syndrome, both ablation attempt number and ablation time to AP
      block were non-significantly lower in the ME group. CONCLUSION: The novel ME
      catheter was advantageous for identifying pathway potentials and reducing initial
      ablation attempt number and ablation time to reach acute ablation endpoint for
      PSVTs. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04215640) This article is protected by

TI  - A real-world study of low-dose thalidomide in severe erythema nodosum leprosum
      highlighting its mechanistic rationale in a resource-constrained target
      population.
LID - 10.1111/ijd.16315 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids remain the main therapy in erythema nodosum leprosum 
      (ENL), and long-term usage in chronic or recurrent ENL is a cause of significant 
      morbidity and mortality. Thalidomide exerts dramatic effect in controlling ENL
      and helps reduce the dose of steroids, but the cost is a hindrance to its usage. 
      METHODS: Patients of ENL (steroid naive and steroid-dependent) were recruited
      over a 1-year period. An escalating dose of low-dose thalidomide with a reducing 
      dose of prednisolone was titrated depending on the control of disease activity.
      The primary aim was to reduce the dose of steroids to the lowest effective dose, 
      and the secondary aim was to stop. RESULTS: Sixteen patients of ENL were studied 
      (mean duration of ENL 22.1 months, 15 severe ENL), and a majority (11/16, 68%)
      were on steroids with a mean duration of 11.27 months. All patients had
      steroid-related side effects (cushingoid habitus 81.8%, weight gain 54.5%,
      diabetes mellitus 9%, hyperlipidemia 18.18%, cataract 18.1%, osteoporosis 36.3%, 
      striae 36.3%, acneiform eruptions 18.1%, and myopathy 9%). Steroids could be
      tapered in a majority of patients (n = 9) within 3 months (mean 2.44 months) with
      a low dose of thalidomide (25-150 mg/day, mean 78.3 mg) achieving a significant
      reduction in prednisolone dose (33.16 mg at baseline; 4.28 mg at 3 months, P <
      0.05). Steroids could be stopped in 92% of patients by 3.03 months, and both
      drugs could be stopped in 80% of cases by 5.83 months. CONCLUSION: The rapid and 
      effective control of ENL with low-dose thalidomide in our series is comparable to
      the historical efficacy of high-dose thalidomide regimens, making it an
      affordable therapy in resource-constrained settings and an excellent
      steroid-sparing agent. The rapid onset of disease control is likely attributable 
      to its action via neutrophils.

      to 6 months after infection.
LID - 10.2217/fmb-2022-0006 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship
      between lung involvement of SARS-CoV-2 and antibody levels of COVID-19 patients 3
      and 6 months from the disease. Methods: A total of 156 participants were divided 
      into two groups, Group 1: lung involvement (LI)-positive and Group 2:
      LI-negative. Biochemical parameters and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels were 
      measured. Results: The results showed that mean levels of urea, LDH, CRP,
      ferritin, neutrophil count and D-dimer were significantly higher in the
      LI-positive group. In addition, mean antibody levels in the 3rd and 6th months
      were higher in the LI-positive group (p < 0.005). Discussion: High antibody
      levels in LI-positive patients correlated with some immunologic and biochemical
      parameters. Further studies should be performed to determine protective antibody 
      levels against reinfection, how long protective titers last and the mechanisms by
      which COVID-19 symptoms, demographics and comorbidities may drive higher antibody
      levels.

TI  - Heterobimetallic Au/Ru Complexes Synthesized via Post-Functionalization and
      Applied in Dual Photoredox-Gold Catalysis.
LID - 10.1002/chem.202201856 [doi]
AB  - The synthesis of heterobimetallic Au(I)/Ru(II) complexes of the general formula
      syn - and anti -[{AuCl}( L1 intersection L2 ){Ru(bpy) 2 }][PF 6 ] 2 is reported. 
      The ditopic bridging ligand L1 intersection L2 refers to a P , N hybrid ligand
      composed of phosphine and bipyridine substructures, which was obtained via a
      post-functionalization strategy based on Diels-Alder reaction between a phosphole
      and a maleimide moiety. It was found that the stereochemistry at the phosphorus
      atom of the resulting 7-phosphanorbornene backbone can be controlled by executing
      the metal coordination and the cycloaddition reaction in a different
      chronological order. All precursors, as well as the mono- and multimetallic
      complexes, were isolated and fully characterized with various spectroscopic
      methods such as NMR, IR, UV-vis and cyclic voltammetry. Photophysical
      measurements show efficient phosphorescence for the investigated monometallic
      complex anti -[( L1 intersection L2 ){Ru(bpy) 2 }][PF 6 ] 2 and the bimetallic
      analogue syn -[{AuCl}( L1 intersection L2 ){Ru(bpy) 2 }][PF 6 ] 2 , indicating a 
      small influence of the {AuCl} fragment on the photoluminescence properties. The
      heterobimetallic Au(I)/Ru(II) complexes syn - and anti -[{AuCl}( L1 intersection 
      L2 ){Ru(bpy) 2 }][PF 6 ] 2 are both active catalysts in the visible-light
      promoted P -arylation of aryldiazonium salts with H -phosphonate affording
      arylphosphonates in yields up to 91%. Both dinuclear complexes outperform the
      monometallic counterparts.

TI  - Liver transplantation for NAFLD cirrhosis: age and recent coronary angioplasty
      are major determinants of survival.
LID - 10.1111/liv.15385 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of end-stage
      non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD), i.e., decompensated cirrhosis and/or
      complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Few data on long-term outcome are 
      available. The aim of this study was to evaluate overall patient and graft
      survivals and associated predictive factors. METHOD: This retrospective
      multicenter study included adult transplant patients for NAFLD cirrhosis between 
      2000 and 2019 in participating French-speaking centers. RESULTS: A total of 361
      patients (69.8% of male) were included in 20 centers. The median age at LT was
      62.3 years [57.4 - 65.9] and the median MELD score was 13.9 [9.1 - 21.3]; 51.8%
      of patients had HCC on liver explant. Between 2004 and 2018, the number of LT for
      NAFLD cirrhosis increased by 720%. A quarter of the patients had cardiovascular
      history before LT. Median follow-up after LT was 39.1 months [15.8 - 72.3].
      Patient survival at 1, 5 and 10 years after LT was 89.3%, 79.8% and 68.1%,
      respectively. The main causes of death were sepsis (37.5%), malignancies (29.2%) 
      and cardiovascular events (22.2%). In multivariate analysis, 3 risk factors for
      overall mortality after LT were recipient pre-LT BMI < 32 kg/m2 at LT time (OR:
      2.272; p=0.012), pre-LT angioplasty during CV check-up (OR: 2.916; p=0.016), a
      combined donor and recipient age over 135 years (OR: 2.020; 95%CI: p=0.035)
      CONCLUSION: Survival after LT for NAFLD cirrhosis is good at 5 years. Donor and
      recipient age, and cardiovascular history, are major prognostic factors to
      consider.

      parameters in hypothyroid induced-rats.
PG  - e23186
LID - 10.1002/jbt.23186 [doi]
AB  - In the study investigating the effects of boron on thyroid hormones and some
      biochemical parameters in hypothyroid rats, 49 Wistar Albino male rats were
      divided into seven groups; (Control (C), Hypothyroidism (H), boron groups (B10,
      and B20), hypothyroid + boron groups (HB10 and HB20), and Treatment (T). Four
      groups (H, HB10, HB20, and T) were administered 10 mg/kg (B10 and HB10), 20 mg/kg
      (B20 and HB20) boron for 3 weeks, respectively after hypothyroidism was induced
      using Propycil(R) containing propylthiouracil (PTU). Thyroid hormone analyses and
      biochemical measurements were made from the serum and thyroid gland tissue was
      examined histopathologically. According to the findings, the fT3 level increased 
      in the B10 group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). While AST, ALT, and
      ALP activities were found to be higher in the hypothyroid group than in the
      control group, AST and ALP activities in the HB10 and HB20 groups decreased to
      values close to the control group. Total cholesterol levels were found to be
      lower in boron-given groups compared to control and hypothyroid groups (p <
      0.05). Sodium iodide symporter (NIS) immunoreactivity was found to be high in
      hypothyroid rat groups. As a result, it was observed that the increased AST and
      ALP activities in rats decreased with boron administration. The serum hormone
      levels measured in the study are not sufficient to understand the effect of boron
      on the thyroid gland, and it was concluded that further studies at the molecular 
      level are needed to understand the effects of boron on the thyroid gland.

TI  - Comparing the associations between host and tumor factors with survival outcomes 
      with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5070 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) immunotherapy has drastically improved
      survival for metastatic melanoma; however, 50% of patients have progression
      within 6 months despite treatment. In this study, we investigated host, and tumor
      factors for metastatic melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.
      METHODS: Patients treated with the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy between 2014 and 2017 
      were identified in Alberta, Canada. All patients had Stage IV melanoma. Patient
      characteristics, investigations, treatment, and clinical outcomes were obtained
      from electronic medical records. RESULTS: We identified 174 patients treated with
      anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. At 37.1 months median follow-up time 135 (77.6%)
      individuals had died and 150 (86.2%) had progressed. An elevated lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH) had a response rate of 21.0% versus 41.0% for those with a
      normal LDH (p = 0.017). Host factors associated with worse median
      progression-free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) included liver
      metastases, >3 sites of disease, elevated LDH, thrombocytosis, neutrophilia,
      anemia, lymphocytopenia, and an elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Primary
      ulcerated tumors had a worse mOS of 11.8 versus 19.3 months (p = 0.042). We
      identified four prognostic subgroups in advanced melanoma patients treated with
      anti-PD-1 therapy. (1) Normal LDH with <3 visceral sites, (2) normal LDH with
      >/=3 visceral sites, (3) LDH 1-2x upper limit of normal (ULN), (4) LDH >/=2x ULN.
      The mPFS each group was 14.0, 6.5, 3.3, and 1.9 months, while the mOS for each
      group was 33.3, 15.7, 7.9, and 3.4 months. CONCLUSION: Our study reports that
      host factors measuring the general immune function, markers of systemic
      inflammation, and tumor burden and location are the most prognostic for survival.

TI  - Associations between ultra- or minimally processed food intake and three
      adiposity indicators among US adults: NHANES 2011 to 2016.
LID - 10.1002/oby.23507 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ultraprocessed food (UPF) intake is associated with BMI, but effects
      on regional adipose depots or related to minimally processed food (MPF) intake
      are unknown. METHODS: Data included 12,297 adults in the National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2011 to 2016. This study analyzed
      associations between usual percentage of kilocalories from UPFs and MPFs and
      three adiposity indicators: supine sagittal abdominal diameter to height ratio
      (SADHtR, estimates visceral adiposity); waist circumference to height ratio
      (WHtR, estimates abdominal adiposity); and BMI, using linear and multinomial
      logistic regression. RESULTS: Standardized beta coefficients per 10% increase in 
      UPF intake were 0.0926, 0.0846, and 0.0791 for SADHtR, WHtR, and BMI,
      respectively (all p < 0.001; p > 0.26 for pairwise differences). For MPF intake, 
      the beta coefficients were -0.0901, -0.0806, and -0.0688 (all p < 0.001; p > 0.18
      pairwise). Adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for adiposity tertile 3 versus tertile 1
      (comparing UPF intake quartiles 2, 3, and 4 to quartile 1) were 1.33 (1.22-1.45),
      1.67 (1.43-1.95), and 2.24 (1.76-2.86), respectively, for SADHtR; 1.31
      (1.19-1.44), 1.62 (1.37-1.91), and 2.13 (1.63-2.78), respectively, for WHtR; and 
      1.27 (1.16-1.39), 1.53 (1.31-1.79), and 1.96 (1.53-2.51), respectively, for BMI. 
      MPF intake showed inverse associations with similar trends in association
      strength. CONCLUSIONS: Among US adults, abdominal and visceral adiposity
      indictors were positively associated with UPFs and inversely associated with
      MPFs.

TI  - The effect of postgraduate osteopathic manipulative treatment training on
      practice: a survey of osteopathic residents.
LID - 10.1515/jom-2021-0260 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Osteopathic medical students receive an abundance of training in
      osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) during their first 2 years of medical
      school and less during the second 2 years. Family Medicine residency programs
      often include significantly more OMT training during residency, but it is less
      frequently applied in other residencies. OBJECTIVES: This survey was designed
      utilizing the theory of planned behavior to see whether specific training in
      osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) after osteopathic medical school was an
      influence in changing behavior, attitudes, and knowledge around OMT in
      osteopathic residents. METHODS: A total of 188 osteopathic medicine residents
      were invited to complete an anonymous cross-sectional online survey. The survey
      asked residents about their postgraduate OMT training and their knowledge,
      attitudes, norms, intentions, and behavior regarding OMT. Inferential statistics 
      were utilized to determine whether significant differences existed by specialty
      and by type of training. RESULTS: Sixty residents (31.9% response rate) completed
      the survey. This response rate is consistent with previous online survey studies,
      but it may indicate that residents chose not to participate due to survey fatigue
      or a lack of interest in OMM. Overall, residents who completed postgraduate
      training reported significantly stronger positive attitudes about the value of
      OMT in patient care (t=3.956; p<0.001). Primary care residents talk to their
      patients about OMT and perform OMT more frequently than residents in surgical
      (p<0.01) and other subspecialties (p<0.01). Residents who completed postgraduate 
      training (n=41) reported significantly more knowledge about the fundamental
      principles (p=0.04), benefits (p=0.03), and common techniques (p=0.01) of OMT,
      and rated their ability to perform OMT (p=0.001) higher than those who had not
      completed postgraduate training. Trained residents also talked to patients about 
      OMT (p<0.001), referred patients for OMT (p=0.01), and performed OMT (p<0.001)
      more frequently. They also reported significantly stronger subjective norms
      (p=0.000; p<0.001), perceived behavioral control (p=0.02; p=0.004), positive
      attitudes (p=0.004; p=0.003), and intentions (p<0.001; p<0.001) regarding talking
      to patients and performing OMT, respectively. Residents who completed in-person
      training reported talking to their patients about OMT (p=0.002) and performing
      OMT (p=0.001) more frequently, and having more confidence in their ability to
      perform OMT (p=0.02). Residents who completed in-person training reported
      significantly stronger subjective norms (p<0.001; p<0.001), perceived behavioral 
      control (p=0.001; p=0.002), positive attitudes (p=0.05; p=0.03), and intentions
      (p<0.001; p=0.001) regarding talking to patients about OMT and performing OMT,
      respectively. Residents who completed in-person training reported stronger
      subjective norms (p=0.05) related to referring patients for OMT. CONCLUSIONS:
      Residents who complete postgraduate training perform OMT, talk to their patients 
      about OMT, and refer patients for OMT more frequently. Residents who participate 
      in training, particularly in-person training, have stronger subjective norms,
      perceived behavioral control, positive attitudes, and behavioral intentions
      regarding talking with patients about OMT and performing OMT. These variables are
      validated predictors of behavior, making them important outcomes for training to 
      promote OMT in patient care.

TI  - Influence of the layer thickness on the flexural strength of aged and non-aged
      additively manufactured interim dental material.
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13582 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To measure the flexural strength and Weibull characteristics of aged and
      non-aged printed interim dental material fabricated with different layer
      thickness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bars (25x2x2mm) were additively fabricated by
      using a polymer printer (Asiga Max) and an interim resin (Nexdent C&B MFH).
      Specimens were fabricated with the same printing parameters and postprocessing
      procedures, but with 7 different layer thickness: 50 (control or 50-G group), 10 
      (10-G group), 25 (25-G group), 75 (75-G group), 100 (100-G group), 125 (125-G
      group), and 150 mum (150-G group). Two subgroups were created: non-aged and aged 
      subgroups (n = 10). A universal testing machine was selected to measure flexural 
      strength. Two-parameter Weibull distribution values were computed. Two-way ANOVA 
      and Tukey tests were elected to examine the data (alpha = .05). RESULTS:
      Artificial aging methods (P<.001) were a significant predictor of the flexural
      strength computed. Aged specimens acquired less flexural strength than non-aged
      specimens. The Weibull distribution obtained the highest shape for non-aged 50-G 
      and 75-G group specimens compared with those of other non-aged groups, while the 
      Weibull distribution showed the highest shape for aged 125-G specimens.
      CONCLUSIONS: The flexural strength of the additively fabricated interim material 
      examined was not influenced by the layer thickness at which the specimens were
      fabricated; however, artificial aging techniques reduced its flexural strength.
      Aged specimens presented lower Weibull distribution values compared with non-aged
      specimens, except for the 125-G specimens. This article is protected by

TI  - Moronic acid improves intestinal inflammation in mice with chronic colitis by
      inhibiting intestinal macrophage polarization.
PG  - e23188
LID - 10.1002/jbt.23188 [doi]
AB  - This study focuses on exploring the role and mechanism of moronic acid (MOA), a
      small triterpenoid molecule, against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intestinal
      macrophages were cultured in vitro, and their M1 polarization was induced by
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). After intervention
      with MOA, the proportion of M1 macrophages was detected, and the levels of
      inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta) were examined by ELISA.
      IFA staining was performed to determine the P50 and CD86 expressions, while
      DCFH-DA was used to determine the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, as well as
      the p-P50 and NLRP3 protein levels. Additionally, we also used N-acetylcysteine, 
      a ROS inhibitor, to further explore the association between MOA and ROS-NF-kappaB
      signaling. In murine experimentation, colitis was induced in mice with DSS. After
      MOA intervention, we assessed the mucosal barrier damage, tissue ROS, as well as 
      protein and inflammatory cytokine levels. MOA could inhibit the M1 polarization
      of intestinal macrophages, suppress the expressions of inflammatory cytokines,
      and reduce the level of ROS-NF-kappaB-NLRP3 signaling. After inhibiting ROS
      through NAC treatment, the effect of MOA was evidently weakened. Clearly, MOA
      exerted its activity via ROS. In the murine model, MOA could lower the CD86 level
      in the intestinal tissues, inhibit the M1 polarization of macrophages, and reduce
      the tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines. This study finds that MOA can
      regulate ROS-NF-kappaB-NLRP3 signaling by inhibiting ROS, thereby suppressing the
      M1 polarization of intestinal macrophages, which plays a protective role in IBD.

TI  - Improved Diagnosis by Automated Macro- and Micro-anatomical Region Mapping of
      Skin Photographs.
LID - 10.1111/jdv.18476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The exact location of skin lesions is key in clinical dermatology. On
      one hand, it supports differential diagnosis (DD) since most skin conditions have
      specific predilection sites. On the other hand, location matters for
      dermatosurgical interventions. In practice, lesion evaluation is not well
      standardized and anatomical descriptions vary or lack altogether. Automated
      determination of anatomical location could benefit both situations. OBJECTIVE:
      Establish an automated method to determine anatomical regions in clinical patient
      pictures and evaluate the gain in DD performance of a deep learning model (DLM)
      when trained with lesion locations and images. METHODS: Retrospective study based
      on three datasets: macro-anatomy for the main body regions with 6000 patient
      pictures partially labeled by a student, micro-anatomy for the ear region with
      182 pictures labeled by a student and DD with 3347 pictures of 16 diseases
      determined by dermatologists in clinical settings. For each dataset a DLM was
      trained and evaluated on an independent test set. The primary outcome measures
      were the precision and sensitivity with 95% CI. For DD, we compared the
      performance of a DLM trained with lesion pictures only with a DLM trained with
      both pictures and locations. RESULTS: The average precision and sensitivity were 
      85% (CI 84-86), 84% (CI 83-85) for macro-anatomy, 81% (CI 80-83), 80% (CI 77-83) 
      for micro-anatomy and 82% (CI 78-85), 81% (CI 77-84) for DD. We observed an
      improvement in DD performance of 6% (McNemar test p-value 0.0009) for both
      average precision and sensitivity when training with both lesion pictures and
      locations. CONCLUSION: Including location can be beneficial for DD DLM
      performance. The proposed method can generate body region maps from patient
      pictures and even reach surgery relevant anatomical precision for e.g. the ear
      region. Our method enables automated search of large clinical databases and make 
      targeted anatomical image retrieval possible.

TI  - Hemodynamic and Anatomic Changes after Fetal Aortic Valvuloplasty are associated 
      with Procedural Success and Postnatal Biventricular Circulation.
LID - 10.1002/pd.6216 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are minimal data characterizing the trajectory of left heart
      growth and hemodynamics following fetal aortic valvuloplasty (FAV). METHODS: This
      retrospective study included patients who underwent FAV between 2000 and 2019
      with echocardiograms performed pre-FAV, immediately post-FAV, and in late
      gestation. RESULTS: Of 118 fetuses undergoing FAV, 106 (90%) underwent
      technically successful FAV, of which 55 (52%) had biventricular circulation.
      Technically successful FAV was associated with improved aortic valve growth
      (p<0.001), sustained antegrade aortic arch (AoA) flow (p=0.02), improved mitral
      valve inflow pattern (p=0.002), and favorable patent foramen ovale (PFO) flow
      pattern (p=0.004) from pre-FAV to late gestation. Compared to patients with
      univentricular outcome, patients with biventricular outcome had less decrement in
      size of the left ventricle (LV) (p<0.001) and aortic valve (p=0.005), as well
      more physiologic PFO flow (p<0.001) and antegrade AoA flow (p<0.001) from pre-FAV
      to late gestation. In multivariable analysis, echocardiographic predictors of
      biventricular outcome were less decline in LV end diastolic dimension (p<0.001), 
      improved PFO flow (p=0.004), and sustained antegrade AoA flow (p=0.002) from
      pre-FAV to late gestation. CONCLUSION: Stabilization of left heart growth and
      improved hemodynamics following successful FAV through late gestation are
      associated with postnatal biventricular circulation. This article is protected by

AB  - AIM: To study the impact of the prosthesis motility on the Quality of Life (QoL) 
      in anophthalmic patients. METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational study of 100
      anophthalmic patients, of whom 64% had an acryl implant, 6% an Allen implant, 1% 
      a hydroxyapatite implant, 4% a dermis fat graft, 16% no implant, and 9% an
      unknown implant. We quantitatively assessed the motility of the prosthesis with
      Kestenbaum glasses and the QoL with a validated questionnaire covering five
      domains: General functional abilities and care, wearing comfort, physical
      appearance, psychological and social functioning. Associations between measured
      prosthetic eye motility, patient-perceived motility, and satisfaction were made. 
      RESULTS: Motility of the prosthesis was impaired with an average loss of 76%, and
      correlated with Cosmetic satisfaction (adduction P = .02, abduction P = .008,
      elevation P = .04) and Social satisfaction (adduction P = .03, abduction P =
      .003). The patient-perceived motility of the prosthesis correlated with General
      functioning abilities (horizontal P = .0004, vertical P = .0004), Comfort
      (horizontal P = .001, vertical P = .003), Cosmetic satisfaction (horizontal P =
      .0002, vertical P = .0002), Psychological satisfaction (horizontal P = .001,
      vertical P = .001), and Social satisfaction (horizontal P = .002, vertical P =
      .003). CONCLUSIONS: Ocular prosthetic motility has a significant impact on
      patient-perceived satisfaction and physical appearance, and predicts coping with 
      the prosthetic condition on the psychosocial level. This highlights the need of
      introducing patient-reported outcome measures in the prosthetic rehabilitation of
      the anophthalmic patient.

AB  - The present study investigated the relationship between MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, and
      MSH6 polymorphisms and toxicity due to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy for
      North Indian lung cancer patients. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
      length polymorphism technique was used to assess the polymorphism. For MSH2 IVS1 
      + 9G > C polymorphism variant type genotype reported a 1.4-fold increased risk of
      anemia (AOR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.98-1.99; p = 0.04) and decreased risk of developing
      gastrointestinal toxicity (diarrhea) (AOR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.28-1.01; p = 0.04). 
      Further, we also reported a 10-fold increased risk of developing severe grade
      anorexia in combined genotype (GC + CC) (AOR = 9.18; 95% CI = 0.98-86.1; p =
      0.05). For MSH2 T > C/-6 polymorphism, variant type reported a 3-fold and 2-fold 
      increased risk of developing severe grade leukopenia (AOR = 3.37; 95% CI =
      1.44-7.88; p = 0.005) and neutropenia respectively (AOR = 2.23; 95% CI =
      1.07-4.66; p = 0.03). For MSH3 G > A polymorphism, heterozygous (GA) and combined
      genotype (GA + AA) reported a 7-fold and 6-fold increased risk of developing
      anemia (AOR = 7.23; 95% CI = 1.51-34.6; p = 0.01, AOR = 6.39; 95% CI = 1.53-26.6;
      p = 0.01). Our results suggest that polymorphisms in DNA mismatch repair genes
      are associated with hematological, and gastrointestinal toxicities and might be
      considered a predictor for pretreatment evaluation in lung cancer patients.

AB  - Oral anticoagulation (OAC) prevents thromboembolism yet greatly increases the
      risk of bleeding, inciting concern among clinicians. Current guidelines lack
      sufficient evidence supporting long-term OAC following successful atrial
      fibrillation catheter ablation (CA). A literature search was performed in PubMed,
      Google Scholar, Medline, and Scopus to seek out studies that compare continued
      and discontinued anticoagulation in post-ablation Atrial fibrillation (AF)
      patients. Funnel plots and Egger's test examined potential bias. Via the
      random-effects model, summary odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)
      were calculated using RevMan (5.4) and STATA (17.0). Twenty studies, including 22
      429 patients (13 505 off-OAC) were analyzed. Stratified CHA2DS2-VASc score >/=2
      examining thromboembolic events (TE) favored OAC continuation (OR 1.86; 95% CI:
      1.02-3.40; P = .04). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated this association was
      attenuated. The on-OAC arm had greater incidence of major bleeding (MB) (OR 0.16;
      95% CI: 0.08-0.95; P < .00001), particularly intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and
      gastrointestinal bleeding (GI); (OR 0.17; 95% CI: 0.08-0.36; P < .00001) and (OR 
      0.12; 95% CI: 0.04-0.32; P < .0001), respectively. Our findings support sustained
      anticoagulation in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of >/=2. Due to reduced
      outcome robustness, physician discretion is still advised.

TI  - Comparison of General Endotracheal Anesthesia vs. Sedation without Endotracheal
      Intubation during Initial PEG Insertion for Infants: A Retrospective Cohort
      Study.
LID - 10.1111/pan.14539 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Critical airway incidents are a major cause of morbidity and
      mortality during anesthesia. Delayed management of airway obstruction quickly
      leads to severe complications due to the reduced apnea tolerance in infants and
      neonates. The decision of whether to intubate the trachea during anesthesia is
      therefore of great importance, particularly as an increasing number of procedures
      are performed outside of the operating room. AIM: In this retrospective cohort
      study, we evaluated airway management for infants below 6 months of age
      undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion. We compared
      demographic, procedural, and health outcome-related data for infants undergoing
      percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion under general endotracheal
      anesthesia (n=105) to those receiving monitored anesthesia care (n=44) without
      endotracheal intubation. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was completed for 
      all infants <6 months of age who underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
      insertion in our institution's endoscopy suite between January 2002 and January
      2017. Descriptive statistics summarized numeric variables using medians and
      corresponding ranges (minimum-maximum), and categorical variables using
      frequencies and percentages. Differences in study outcomes between patients
      undergoing general anesthesia or monitored-anesthesia-care were evaluated with
      univariate quantile or Firth logistic regression for numerical and categorical
      outcomes, respectively. Results are presented as beta [95% confidence interval]
      or odds ratio [95% confidence interval] along with corresponding p-values.
      RESULTS: Both groups were similar in distribution of age, race, and gender.
      However, patients selected for general anesthesia had lower median body weights
      (3.9 kg [range: 2.0-6.7] vs 4.4 kg [range: 2.6-6.9]), higher percentages of
      cardiac (95.2 vs 84.1%), and/or neurologic comorbidities (74.3 vs 56.8%) and were
      more frequently given American Society of Anesthesiologists level IV
      classifications (41.9 vs 29.6%) indicating that these infants may have had more
      severe disease than patients selected for monitored-anesthesia-care. Three
      monitored-anesthesia-care patients required intraoperative conversion to general 
      anesthesia. General anesthesia patients experienced greater odds of
      intraoperative hypoxemia (45.2 vs 29.0%; odds ratio: 2.0 [0.9-4.3], p-value: .09)
      and required post-operative airway intervention more frequently than
      monitored-anesthesia-care patients (13.3 vs 2.3%; odds ratio: 4.6 [0.8-25.6],
      p-value: .08). Procedure times were identical in both groups (6 minutes), but
      general anesthesia resulted in longer median anesthesia times (44 minutes [range:
      22-292]vs 12 minutes [range:19-136]; beta:13 [95% 6.9-19.1], p-value: < .001).
      CONCLUSION: Study results suggest that providers selected general anesthesia over
      monitored-anesthesia-care for infants and neonates with low body weights, cardiac
      comorbidities, and neurologic comorbidities. Increased rates of airway
      intervention, and increased length of stay may be at least partially related to
      more severe patient comorbidity, as indicated by higher American Society of
      Anesthesiologists classifications. However, due to the exploratory nature of
      these analyses, further confirmatory studies are needed to evaluate the impact of
      airway selection during PEG on post-operative patient outcomes.

TI  - Second-line treatment options in advanced thymic carcinoma after failure of
      platinum-based chemotherapy: A multicenter retrospective study.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5053 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently there is no standard therapy recommended for second-line
      treatment for thymic carcinoma. Our study compared multidrug chemotherapy,
      single-agent chemotherapy, and PD-1 inhibitors in patients diagnosed with
      advanced thymic carcinoma who had previous platinum-based chemotherapy at the
      clinic. METHODS: The study included patients with thymic carcinoma who failed
      first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier methods were applied in the 
      study for estimating the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
      (OS) curves. Pearson chi-square or Fisher's exact chi-square test was adopted to 
      make comparisons of the objective response rate (ORR) between treatment groups.
      Cox regression was used for the multivariate analyses in PFS and OS. RESULTS:
      Among the 92 patients enrolled, multidrug chemotherapy was used in 51 (55.4%)
      patients for second-line therapy. Thirty-six patients (35.9%) received
      single-agent chemotherapy, and eight patients (8.7%) underwent PD-1 inhibitors.
      The multidrug chemotherapy group showed better efficacy than the other two
      groups, with an ORR of 35.3% (p = 0.006). The median PFS of multidrug
      chemotherapy, single-agent chemotherapy and PD-1 inhibitors were 5.0 months, 3.0 
      months, and 4.0 months, respectively (p = 0.008). Patients in the multidrug
      chemotherapy group also showed an advantage in OS in comparison with the other
      two treatment groups (p = 0.045), with a median OS of 30.4 months. Multivariate
      analysis showed that second-line treatment was independent factor for both PFS (p
      = 0.035) and OS (p = 0.037). Grade 3-4 AEs were mostly detected in patients
      receiving multidrug chemotherapy and were primarily hematologic.
      Treatment-related mortality was not found in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Multidrug chemotherapy had a trend toward a more positive response rate and
      outcomes in longer survival time than single-agent chemotherapy and PD-1
      inhibitors. Multidrug chemotherapy is a choice worth considering for second-line 
      therapy in patients with thymic carcinoma if tolerable.

TI  - Interstitial pneumonitis associated with EGFR/ ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors
      used in non-small cell lung cancer: an observational, retrospective,
      pharmacovigilance study.
LID - 10.1080/14740338.2022.2110235 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor/ Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors (EGFR/ALK TKIs) may provoke fatal interstitial pneumonitis
      (IP). The study was conducted to characterise the main characteristics of
      EGFR/ALK TKI-induced IP and identify factors associated with death. RESEARCH
      DESIGN AND METHODS: A disproportionality analysis was conducted using Vigibase,
      the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database. Clinical features of
      patients with EGFR/ALK-TKI-related IP were compared between the fatal and
      non-fatal groups. RESULTS: A total of 3355 EGFR/ALK-TKI-IP events were
      identified, over half of them from Asia (57.47%) and mostly the aged (63.21%).
      Osimertinib appeared the strongest IP association. The median time to onset (TTO)
      was 40 (interquartile range [IQR] 16-84) days. There were significant differences
      between the fatal and non-fatal groups in terms of reporting year and TKI
      regimens (P < 0.05). The fatality rate of erlotinib-induced IP was the highest
      (35.54%). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that EGFR/ALK TKIs were associated with IP
      that had a high fatality rate and tend to occur earlier in fatal cases. It is
      necessary to raise awareness of IP surveillance when EGFR/ALK TKIs were
      administered.

TI  - The use of an antiseptic rinse (NanArgol) for the oral hygiene maintenance of
      subjects with fixed appliances: a randomized clinical trial.
LID - 10.1111/idh.12608 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of periodontal diseases development increased in patients
      with malocclusion undergoing orthodontic treatment. Thus, the aim of this study
      was to examine the efficacy of the use of adjunctive rinses with nano-Argentum to
      standard oral hygiene regimen in subjects wearing fixed orthodontic appliances
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty patients were observed for 1 year. They were
      divided in two groups: in test group patients were instructed to rinse with
      non-ionic colloidal silver solution according to protocol for 6 months as an
      adjunct to standard; in control group the patients followed the standard oral
      hygiene regimen. Index of efficiency of oral hygiene (PHPm), community
      periodontal index (CPI), and papillary-marginal-alveolar index (PMA) were
      evaluated before treatment, and after one and six months. For statistics analysis
      Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis tests and Pearson criterion were used. RESULTS:
      Baseline hygiene levels in two groups had no differences. Oral hygiene indices
      were significantly lower in the test group in comparison with control after 1
      month (PHPm = 0.38 +/- 0.18 and 1.19+/-0.45 respectively, p<0.01; PMA =
      11.78+/-8.5 and 47.25+/-20.9 respectively, p<0.05; CPI = 0.65+/-0.53 and
      1.53+/-0.77 respectively, p<0.01) and 6 months (PHPm = 0.5+/-0.2 and 1.2+/-0.4
      respectively, p <0.01; PMA = 11.62+/-19.6 and 66.33+/-27.9 respectively, p<0.01; 
      CPI = 0.63+/-0.73 and 1.68+/-0.78 respectively, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The use of 
      the test solution as an adjunct to standard oral hygiene provided a significant
      beneficial effect in terms of oral hygiene in patients undergoing orthodontic
      treatment.

TI  - The Role of MR Assessments of Cardiac Morphology, Function, and Tissue
      Characteristics on Exercise Capacity in Well-Functioning Older Adults.
LID - 10.1002/jmri.28373 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between resting cardiac indices and exercise
      capacity in older adults was still not well understood. New developments in
      cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enable a much fuller assessment of
      cardiac characteristics. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the association between
      exercise capacity and specific aspects of resting cardiac structure, function,
      and tissue. STUDY TYPE: Cross-sectional study. POPULATION: A total of 112
      well-functioning older adults (mean age 69 years, 52 men). FIELD
      STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: All participants underwent 3.0 T MRI, using scan protocols
      including balanced steady-state free precession cine sequence, modified
      look-locker inversion recovery, and T2-prepared single-shot balanced steady-state
      free precession. ASSESSMENT: Demographic and geriatric characteristics were
      collected. Blood samples were assayed for lipid and glucose related biomarkers.
      All participants performed a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test to
      achieve peakVO2 . Cardiac MRI parameters were measured with semi-automatic
      software by S.Y., an 18-year experienced radiologist. STATISTICAL TESTS:
      Demographic, geriatric characteristics and MR measurements were compared among
      quartiles of peakVO2, with different methods according to the data type.
      Spearman's partial correlation and least absolute shrinkage selection operator
      regression were performed to select significant MR features associated with
      peakVO2 . Mediation effect analysis was conducted to test any indirect connection
      between age and peakVO2 . A two-sided P value of <0.05 was defined statistical
      significance. RESULTS: Epicardial fat volume, left atrial volume indexed to
      height, right ventricular end-systolic volume indexed to body surface area and
      global circumferential strain (GCS) were correlated with peakVO2 (regression
      coefficients were -0.040, -0.093, 0.127, and 0.408, respectively). Mediation
      analysis showed that the total effect of peakVO2 change was 43.6% from the change
      of age. The proportion of indirect effect from epicardial fat volume and GCS were
      11.8% and 15.1% in total effect, respectively. DATA CONCLUSION: PeakVO2 was
      associated with epicardial fat volume, left atrial volume, right ventricular
      volume and GCS of left ventricle. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 4 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 5.

TI  - Calf-cow and bull-cow management in buffaloes: Effects on growth, productive and 
      reproductive performance of mothers and their calves.
LID - 10.1111/rda.14219 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the first study was to determine the influence of the calf handling
      (restricted or full contact) and fenceline bull stimulation on performance of
      mothers and their calves. The aim of the second study was to determine the
      relative impact of calf-bull contact, comparing the result of restricted calf and
      no bull with that of fenceline calf contact and direct bull contact on the
      performance of mother buffaloes and their calves. In Experiment 1, 24 mother-calf
      dyads were allocated to three treatments: NCB (no calf-mother-bull contact),
      RC-FBC (restricted calf and fenceline bull contact) and FC-FBC (fenceline calf
      and fenceline bull contact). In Experiment 2, another 24 mother-calf dyads were
      allocated to two treatments: RC-NB (restricted calf and no bull contact) and
      FC-DBC (fenceline calf and direct bull contact). In Experiment 1, average daily
      gain (ADG) was greater in FC-FBC than RC-FBC and NCB calves (p < .05). Average
      dry matter intake (DMI) was greater in FC-FBC than RC-FBC and NCB calves. DMI of 
      buffaloes was greater in FC-FBC than RC-FBC and NCB. Daily milk yield of
      buffaloes was more (p < .05) in FC-FBC (10.2 +/- 0.2 kg) than RC-FBC (8.4 +/- 0.2
      kg) and RC-FBC (7.8 +/- 0.2 kg). There were no statistical differences observed
      in the interval from calving to first oestrus, first service, service period
      among three groups. In Experiment 2, ADG's and DMI were greater in FC-FBC calves 
      than RC-FBC (p < .05). DMI of buffaloes was greater in FC-DBC than RC-NBC (p <
      .05). Daily milk yield of buffaloes was greater (p < .05) in FC-DBC (11.6 +/- 0.2
      kg) than RC-NBC (8.3 +/- 0.2 kg). The first oestrus (51.5 +/- 3.1 vs. 103.2 +/-
      7.2), days to first service (74.8 +/- 3.5 vs.112.0 +/- 7.6) and service period
      (78.8 +/- 4.8 vs.118.9 +/- 8.3 days) were lower (p < .05) in FC-DBC than RC-NBC
      buffaloes. The fenceline calf-mother contact increased the growth rate, FCR, and 
      feeding efficiency of buffalo calves; reduced some stress responses and improved 
      the productive performance of buffalo mothers. Further, mother-bull contact
      stimulated the post-partum reproductive performance of buffaloes in fenceline
      calf contact.

TI  - Prevalence of halitosis among young adults in Dunedin, New Zealand.
LID - 10.1111/idh.12609 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of halitosis in young adults. METHODS: 
      Young adults (n = 372; mean age = 21.0 +/- 2.6 years old, range = 18-30 years) in
      Dunedin, New Zealand were recruited into the cross sectional study after
      providing informed consent. The prevalence of halitosis was determined using both
      objective measurements (parts per billion [ppb] volatile sulphur compounds [VSCs]
      in the exhaled air) and subjective measurements (self-reported halitosis
      questionnaire, tongue coating index, and organoleptic assessment). RESULTS: VSC
      measurements indicated that the prevalence of halitosis (values >/= 140 ppb) was 
      31.2%; 25.6% of participants self-reported halitosis. The organoleptic assessment
      revealed that 14.3% of the participants had a score of >/=2. A positive
      correlation was found between the VSC measurements and organoleptic assessment (p
      < 0.05). No significant relationship was found between self-reported halitosis
      and either organoleptic assessment or VSC measurements. Self-reported dry mouth, 
      smoking, oral hygiene index, DMFT index, and tongue coating score were
      significantly associated with the organoleptic assessment (p < 0.05). The
      self-reported dry mouth, mouth breathing and tongue coating score were
      significantly associated with the VSC scores (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Halitosis,
      as represented by VSC, was found in 31.2% of the participants. VSC scores and
      organoleptic assessment were positively correlated. There was no significant
      relationship between self-reported halitosis and either organoleptic assessment
      or VSC measurements.

TI  - Geriatric risk and protective factors for serious COVID-19 outcomes among older
      adults in Shanghai Omicron wave.
PG  - 1-22
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2022.2109517 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Omicron variant was featured with high transmissibility and striking 
      antibody evasion. Shanghai has been experiencing Omicron wave since March 2022.
      Though several studies have evaluated the risk factors of severe infections, the 
      analyses of BA.2 infection risk and protective factors among geriatric people was
      much limited. METHODS: This multicenter cohort study described clinical
      characteristics of geriatric Omicron infections (aged more than 60), and assessed
      risk and protective factors for severe infections. RESULTS: A total of 1377
      patients older than 60 were enrolled, with 75.96% had comorbidities. The median
      viral shedding time and hospitalization time was 9 and 8 days, respectively.
      Severe/critical were associated with longer virus clearance time (aOR
      [95%CI]:0.706(0.533-0.935), P=0.015)), while fully vaccinated/booster and
      paxlovid use shortened viral shedding time (1.229 [1.076-1.402], P=0.002; 1.140
      [.019-1.274], P=0.022, respectively). Older age (>80), cerebrovascular disease,
      and chronic kidney disease were risk factors of progressing to severe/critical.
      Fully vaccination was a significant protective factor of severe infections
      (0.237[0.071-0.793], P=0.019). Further, we found patients with more than two
      comorbidities were more likely to get serious outcome in all age groups.
      CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that in the elderly older than 60 years
      old, older age (aged over 80), cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidney
      disease were risk factors of severe infection. Patients with more than two
      comorbidities were more likely to get serious outcome. Fully vaccinated/booster
      patients were less likely to be severe and vaccinations could shorten viral
      shedding time. The limitation of lacking overall spectrum of COVID-19 infections 
      among elders could be compensated in other larger scale studies in the future.

AB  - Objective:To investigate the application value of bone marrow megakaryocyte
      count, the proportion of megakaryocytes at each stage, and the platelet parameter
      in the clinical diagnosis of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Methods: The 
      megakaryocyte and platelet parameter level in 62 ITP and 40 control group
      patients were compared and analyzed. Linear correlation analysis, Pearson
      correlation analysis, and ROC curves were performed for the correlation between
      megakaryocytes and platelet parameters. Results: Compared to the control group,
      the total number of megakaryocytes, the promegakaryocytes the granular
      megakaryocytes (GMeg), and naked megakaryocytes (NMeg), MPV, and P-LCR% in the
      ITP group increased. All differences were statistically significant (P<0.05).
      While the proportion of platelet-producing megakaryocytes (PMeg), PLT, and PCT
      decreased in the ITP group. These differences were statistically significant (P <
      0.05). PLT was strongly positively correlated with PCT (r = 0.921, p<0.01). PCT
      was weakly positively with MPV (r = 0.309, p<0.05). MPV was positively correlated
      with P-LCR (r = 0.856, p<0.01). PDW was weakly positively correlated with P-LCR
      (r = 0.296, p<0.05) and Meg (r = 0.301, p<0.05), and negatively correlated with
      PMeg (r = -0.336, p<0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that PLT, PCT MPV and P-LCR%
      gave a high sensitivity100.0%81.0%74.6%90.5%respectively.) and specificity
      (100.0%, 92.5%, 80.0%, 77.5%, respectively.) in diagnosis of ITP. Conclusion: The
      combined analysis of bone marrow megakaryocyte count, the proportion of
      megakaryocyte classification at each stage, and platelet parameters have an
      important reference value for auxiliary diagnosis of ITP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs is a common disease in
      vascular surgery. Approximately 20-50% of deep vein thrombosis patients develop
      post-thrombotic syndrome, which can severely affect the patient's quality of
      life. However, the precise science of the pathophysiology of the progression of
      the post-thrombotic syndrome remains unclear. Studies have demonstrated that
      patients with post-thrombotic syndrome of the lower limbs have impaired arterial 
      wall endothelial function. Nevertheless, there is little research on the
      different impacts of post-thrombotic syndrome on the arterial wall endothelial
      function between the affected limbs and the healthy limbs. This study aims to
      assess this difference. METHODS: A total of 60 patients treated for the
      post-thrombotic syndrome of the lower limbs were included. The flow-mediated
      dilation (FMD%) and nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (NMD%) were measured to
      assess the different endothelial function alterations of the common femoral
      arterial wall between the affected limb and the healthy limb. RESULTS: No
      significant differences in the common femoral artery diameter between the
      affected limbs and the healthy limbs were discovered (8.94 +/- 0.92 mm vs 8.75
      +/- 1.0 mm, P = 0.710). The flow-mediated dilation of the common femoral artery
      of the affected limbs were significantly lower compared to the healthy limbs
      (FMD%: 3.21 +/- 1.07% vs 5.19 +/- 1.35%, P = 0.001). However, there was no
      significant difference in the nitroglycerin-mediated dilation of the common
      femoral artery between the affected limbs and the healthy limbs NMD%: 13.37 +/-
      1.78% versus 14.45 +/- 2.14%, P = 0.083). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated
      the association between post-thrombotic syndrome and deteriorated endothelial
      functional properties of the arterial wall of the lower limbs. Endothelial
      dysfunction of the arteries wall was more severe in the affected lower limbs with
      the post-thrombotic syndrome than in the healthy limbs. The mentioned findings
      may partly explain the pathophysiology of the progression post-thrombotic
      syndrome of the lower limbs. HIGHLIGHTS: tudies have demonstrated that patients
      with post-thrombotic syndrome of the lower limbs have impaired arterial wall
      endothelial function. Our results demonstrated the endothelial dysfunction of the
      arteries wall was more severe in the affected lower limbs with the
      post-thrombotic syndrome than in the healthy limbs. Our findings may partly
      explain the pathophysiology of the progression post-thrombotic syndrome of the
      lower limbs.

LID - 10.1017/ice.2022.178 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of changes to urinalysis with reflex to culture
      (UARC) reflex criteria on culture performance and clinical decision outcomes.
      DESIGN: Retrospective study utilizing interrupted time series analysis from
      December 2018 to November 2020. Primary outcomes were measures of culture
      performance. Secondary outcomes were rates of antimicrobial prescription for
      suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and catheter-associated urinary tract
      infection (CAUTI). We also assessed harmful events related to antimicrobial
      prescription for all causes and UTI, UTI symptoms, and sepsis. SETTING: A
      415-bed, academic, tertiary-care, medical center. PATIENTS: Hospitalized adult
      patients with urine testing performed. INTERVENTION: UARC reflex criteria were
      changed on October 22, 2019, from >/=5x10(9)/L white blood cells (WBCs) or trace 
      leukocyte esterase or positive nitrite units on urinalysis to only >/=15x10(9)/L 
      WBCs. RESULTS: The study included 11,322 unique UARC tests. We detected a
      significant decrease in the rate of urine cultures performed from UARC after the 
      intervention (32.5-8.7 cultures per 1,000 patient days; P < .001), with improved 
      diagnostic efficacy (ie, culture positivity increased from 34.8% to 62.1%). CAUTI
      rates did not change. We detected a significant decrease in antimicrobial
      prescription rates (P = .05), this was primarily driven by preintervention
      changes. One case of sepsis occurred secondary to a missed UTI, and UTIs were
      rarely missed after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a stricter
      UARC reflex criterion was associated with a decrease in culture rates with
      improved diagnostic efficacy without significant adverse events. Continued
      education is needed to change antimicrobial prescribing practices.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of filgotinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and
      inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): A
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Filgotinib has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) in adults who respond inadequately to disease-modifying
      antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in Europe and Japan. Several randomized controlled
      trials (RCTs) have investigated its efficacy and safety in adult patients with
      RA. This meta-analysis aimed to study the efficacy and safety of filgotinib in
      patients with RA withan inadequate response to methotrexateor other DMARDs.
      METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify articles in
      PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from inceptionto December 1, 2021. 
      Outcomes of interest included ACR20/50/70 responses, DAS28-CRP </= 3.2, SF-36 PCS
      Score, FACIT-fatigue, SDAI,CDAI, and HAQ-DI, which were assessed after treatment.
      The safety outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and
      serious TEAEs. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled
      for categorical variables, and the mean difference with 95%CI were pooled for
      continuous variables. We used Review Manager 5.3 for the standard meta-analysis. 
      This study followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). RESULTS: Four RCTs comparing
      filgotinib (200 and 100 mg once daily) with placebo were identified. Compared
      with placebo, 200 and 100 mg filgotinib was more effective in achieving
      ACR20/50/70 responses and other outcomes at weeks 12 and 24 (P < 0.05), with no
      significant difference in safety outcomes (P > 0.05). Filgotinib 200 mg performed
      better than filgotinib 100 mg in terms of ACR20/50 responses, DAS28-CRP </= 3.2, 
      SDAI, and CDAI at weeks 12 and 24, and caused fewer serious TEAEs than the 100 mg
      dose. CONCLUSIONS: Filgotinib is effective in the treatment of RA, and the 200 mg
      dose has a more beneficialprofile thanthe 100 mg dose.

TI  - Validation of a disease-specific health-related quality of life measure in adult 
      Portuguese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: LupusQoL-PT.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: LupusQoL is a questionnaire specifically designed to assess
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in SLE patients. We report on the
      translation and cross-cultural adaptation of LupusQoL into European Portuguese.
      METHODS: Translation and cultural adaptation were performed according to standard
      protocol described by the original developers. LupusQoL-PT was administered to
      patients during a routine visit from an outpatient clinic at a university
      hospital in Portugal. Content structure was validated using factorial analysis.
      Cronbach's alpha coefficient was computed for internal consistency.
      Sociodemographic were questioned during the visit and clinical data were
      collected during the visit and from the clinical files. Pearson's correlation,
      T-test, Mann-Whitney and one-way ANOVA were applied to test internal and external
      validation. RESULTS: Seventy-nine SLE patients (78 woman: 1 man) were evaluated. 
      Most had Low disease activity (mean SLEDAI-2k = 3.49; standard deviation 4.80),
      19% had moderate to severe activity and 38% had damage accrual (mean SDI = 0.75; 
      standard deviation 1.05). Cronbach's alpha coefficient was at least 0.812,
      confirming good internal consistency. Correlation coefficient and test-retest
      correlation between the eight domains of LupusQoL-PT were strong in almost every 
      domain (p < 0.01). External convergent analysis showed strong correlation between
      LupusQoL-PT and Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-item version 2 and visual
      analogic scale. Current disease activity was negative correlated with "Body
      Image" domain. There was no correlation between other LupusQoL-PT domains and
      SLEDAI-2k on divergent validity. Patients with previous neuropsychiatric and
      DMARDs treatment had lower HRQoL in emotional domains, while patients with renal 
      damage accrual had HRQoL impact in both physical and emotional domains.
      Portuguese SLE patients had lower HRQoL than French and Italian validation
      cohorts' patients, and higher than Spanish cohorts. CONCLUSION: LupusQoL-PT has
      shown adequate metric properties and should be considered an appropriate tool to 
      evaluate HRQoL in Portuguese SLE patients.

TI  - Mehran 2 Contrast-Associated Acute Kidney Injury Risk Score: Is it Applicable to 
      the Asian Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Population?
PG  - 10760296221116353
LID - 10.1177/10760296221116353 [doi]
AB  - Contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) can occur after percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI). The Mehran score is the gold standard for predicting
      CA-AKI risk, and it has recently been updated. The Mehran 2 CA-AKI risk score,
      based on existing variables in patients undergoing PCI, can accurately
      differentiate the risk of CA-AKI. This study aimed to verify whether the new
      Mehran score is applicable to the Asian PCI population. The study included the
      clinical data of 2487 patients undergoing PCI from August 2020 to February 2022. 
      The goodness-of-fit test (Hosmer-Lemeshow) was used to evaluate the correction
      ability of the Mehran 2 score, and the area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve (ROC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the Mehran 2
      score in predicting CA-AKI. CA-AKI occurred in 28 of 2487 patients, with an
      incidence rate of 1.12%. The proportion of high risk factors for AKI in the
      cohort was lower than that in the Mehran 2 cohort (a large contemporary PCI
      cohort to develop the Mehran 2 score). The Mehran 2 risk score had excellent
      goodness-of-fit (chi2 = 5.320, df = 6, P = 0.503) and high predictive accuracy
      (area under the ROC curve 0.836, P < 0.0001). The Mehran 2 score shows good
      predictive and correction performance in the Asian population and has good
      clinical application value. The inclusion of the Mehran 2 risk score in patients 
      hospitalised for coronary angiography appears to be good practice.

      bridges, forming chains running in the [100] direction. The octahedral
      coordination geometry around the Fe(II) centre is completed by a bidentate
      5,5'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine ligand. Two polymorphs for this compound were
      obtained from the crude reaction product, the first in the space group P-1 and
      the other in P21/c. The molecular and crystal structures are very similar for
      both forms, the main difference being that the eight-membered Fe(mu-1,3-N3)2Fe
      metallacycle formed with end-to-end azide ligands has a nearly flat conformation 
      in the triclinic form and a chair conformation in the monoclinic form. In spite
      of this geometric difference, both forms have the same density, the same packing 
      index and similar arrangements of the one-dimensional chains in the crystal. As a
      consequence, they also share very similar Hirshfeld surfaces and fingerprint
      plots. However, a density functional theory (DFT) computational study showed that
      the monoclinic form is more stable than the triclinic form by ca 30.5 kJ mol(-1).

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of same-site trabeculectomy
      (TRAB) with mitomycin C (MMC) and Ologen (Aeon Astron Europe BV. Leiden, The
      Netherlands) in patients with a failed non-penetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS).
      METHODS: A retrospective study of 24 consecutive eyes (22 patients) undergoing
      reintervention by same-site TRAB with at least one-year follow-up after failed
      NPDS. Mean visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and use of glaucoma
      medications were compared before and one year after surgery. Early and late
      postoperative complications were registered. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was
      performed according to four levels of success criteria. RESULTS: Overall the mean
      IOP reduced significantly (24.9 +/- 7.1 vs. 14.4 +/- 4.5 mmHg; p < 0.001), and
      the number of glaucoma medications (2.80 +/- 1.01 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.94; p < 0.001)
      significantly decreased, one year after surgery. The mean VA remained stable one 
      year after surgery (p = 0.516). Hypotony, defined as IOP </= 5 mmHg, in the early
      postoperative period was observed in 62.5% of eyes, but only in 2 patients
      (8.33%) in the long term. The mean survival time ranged from 10 months (CI 95%
      5-15) to 29 months (CI 95%: 26-32) according to the most stringent and lenient
      success criteria respectively. CONCLUSION: Same-site TRAB augmented with MMC and 
      Ologen may provide an effective, safe and lasting alternative following failed
      NPDS, especially when sparing of the conjunctiva is highly desirable.
      Postoperative hypotony is the most common postoperative complication.

TI  - The moderate-intensity continuous exercise maintains renal blood flow and does
      not impair the renal function.
PG  - e15420
LID - 10.14814/phy2.15420 [doi]
AB  - Exercise is restricted for individuals with reduced renal function because
      exercising reduces blood flow to the kidneys. Safe and effective exercise
      programs for individuals with reduced renal function have not yet been developed.
      We previously examined the relationship between exercise intensity and renal
      blood flow (RBF), revealing that moderate-intensity exercise did not reduce RBF. 
      Determining the effects of exercise duration on RBF may have valuable clinical
      applications. The current study examined the effects of a single bout of
      continuous exercise at lactate threshold (LT) intensity on renal hemodynamics.
      Eight adult males participated in this study. Participants underwent 30 min of
      aerobic exercise at LT intensity using a cycle ergometer. Evaluation of renal
      hemodynamics was performed before and after exercise, in the recovery phase using
      ultrasound echo. Furthermore, blood and urine samplings were conducted before and
      after exercise, in the recovery phase. Compared with resting, RBF was not
      significantly changed immediately after continuous exercise (319 +/- 102 vs. 308 
      +/- 79 ml/min; p = 0.976) and exhibited no significant changes in the recovery
      phase. Moreover, urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (uKIM-1) level exhibited no
      significant change immediately after continuous exercise (0.52 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.46 
      +/- 0.27 mug/g creatinine; p = 0.447). In addition, the results revealed no
      significant change in urinary uKIM-1 in 60-min after exercise. Other renal injury
      biomarkers exhibited a similar pattern. These findings indicate that a single
      bout of moderate-intensity continuous exercise maintains RBF and does not induce 
      renal injury.

TI  - Isolated knee extensor exercise training improves skeletal muscle vasodilation,
      blood flow, and functional capacity in patients with HFpEF.
PG  - e15419
LID - 10.14814/phy2.15419 [doi]
AB  - Patients with HFpEF experience severe exercise intolerance due in part to
      peripheral vascular and skeletal muscle impairments. Interventions targeting
      peripheral adaptations to exercise training may reverse vascular dysfunction,
      increase peripheral oxidative capacity, and improve functional capacity in HFpEF.
      Determine if 8 weeks of isolated knee extension exercise (KE) training will
      reverse vascular dysfunction, peripheral oxygen utilization, and exercise
      capacity in patients with HFpEF. Nine HFpEF patients (66 +/- 5 years, 6 females) 
      performed graded IKE exercise (5, 10, and 15 W) and maximal exercise testing
      (cycle ergometer) before and after IKE training (3x/week, 30 min/leg). Femoral
      blood flow (ultrasound) and leg vascular conductance (LVC; index of vasodilation)
      were measured during graded IKE exercise. Peak pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2 ;
      Douglas bags) and cardiac output (QC ; acetylene rebreathe) were measured during 
      graded maximal cycle exercise. IKE training improved LVC (pre: 810 +/- 417, post:
      1234 +/- 347 ml/min/100 mmHg; p = 0.01) during 15 W IKE exercise and increased
      functional capacity by 13% (peak VO2 during cycle ergometry; pre:12.4 +/- 5.2,
      post: 14.0 +/- 6.0 ml/min/kg; p = 0.01). The improvement in peak VO2 was
      independent of changes in Qc (pre:12.7 +/- 3.5, post: 13.2 +/- 3.9 L/min; p =
      0.26) and due primarily to increased a-vO2 difference (pre: 10.3 +/- 1.6, post:
      11.0 +/- 1.7; p = 0.02). IKE training improved vasodilation and functional
      capacity in patients with HFpEF. Exercise interventions aimed at increasing
      peripheral oxidative capacity may be effective therapeutic options for HFpEF
      patients.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor-1 reduces hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and
      oxidative stress and inhibits cell apoptosis through PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4/CHOP
      signaling.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/01902148.2022.2106388 [doi]
AB  - Background: Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a member of the insulin family,
      has a high degree of homology with insulin and exhibits anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidative stress properties. However, the potential protective effect of
      IGF-1 on hyperoxia-induced lung injury remains unknown. In this study, we aimed
      to explore the effects and mechanism of action of IGF-1 in hyperoxia-induced lung
      injury in neonatal rats. Materials and Methods: Hematoxylin-eosin staining was
      used to observe pathological changes in lung tissue; transmission electron
      microscopy was used to examine the ultrastructure, and ELISA was used to detect
      the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Further,
      malondialdehyde, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase activities in lung tissue 
      were evaluated. TUNEL staining was used to detect cell apoptosis, and western
      blot analysis was used to detect the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, p-PERK,
      p-eIF2alpha, ATF4, and CHOP in the lung tissue. Moreover, the wet/dry weight
      ratio of lung tissue was determined. Results: Intraperitoneal injection of IGF-1 
      effectively reduced lung tissue damage induced by hyperoxia; production of
      inflammatory cells and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress,
      and cell apoptosis. Further, IGF-1 down-regulated the expression of ATF4, CHOP,
      and Bax/Bcl-2, and inhibited the phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2alpha.
      Conclusion: The results suggest that IGF-1 reduces hyperoxia-induced lung
      inflammation and oxidative stress in neonatal rats through the
      PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway and inhibits cell apoptosis.

TI  - Temperature profiles during ureteroscopy with thulium fiber laser and holmium:YAG
      laser: Findings from a pre-clinical study.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/21681805.2022.2104367 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate temperature profiles in both 
      the renal pelvis and parenchyma during Thulium Fiber Laser (TFL) and
      Holmium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser activation in an ex-vivo porcine 
      model. METHODS: Three porcine kidneys with intact renal pelvis and proximal
      ureters were used in the study. A temperature sensor was inserted through a
      nephrostomy tube into the renal pelvis and a second sensor was inserted directly 
      into the renal parenchyma. Temperatures were recorded during continuous laser
      activation for 180 s, and for an additional 60 s after deactivation. TFL (150 mum
      and 200 mum) and Ho:YAG (270 mum) laser delivered power at settings of 2.4 W, 8
      W, 20 W and 30 W. RESULTS: Intrapelvic temperatures correlated directly to power 
      settings. Higher power produced higher temperatures. For example, using a 150 mum
      fiber at 2.4 W resulted in a 2.6 degrees C rise from baseline (p = 0.008),
      whereas using the same fiber at 20 W produced a rise in temperature of 19.9
      degrees C (p = 0.02). Larger laser fibers caused significantly higher
      temperatures compared to smaller fibers using equivalent power settings, e.g.
      mean temperature at 20 W using 150 mum was 39.6 degrees C compared to 44.9
      degrees C using 200 mum, p < 0.001. There was a significant increase in
      parenchymal temperatures when applying 20 W and 30 W of laser power with the two 
      larger fibers. CONCLUSION: In this ex-vivo study, renal temperatures correlated
      directly to power settings. Higher power produced higher temperatures.
      Furthermore, larger laser fibers caused higher temperatures. These findings could
      help guide selection of safe power settings for ureteroscopic lithotripsy, but
      future clinical studies are needed for confirmation.

TI  - The Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Related Medications on COVID-19
      Severity and Outcome: A Tertiary Referral Center Experience from Turkey.
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2022.22059 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 has become a serious pandemic, and still
      remains a risk despite vaccines that have been devel- oped. Among inflammatory
      bowel disease patients old age, inflammatory bowel disease activation, the
      existence of the comorbid dis- ease, and using steroids are known risk factors
      for severe coronavirus disease-2019. But there are different data for drugs other
      than corticosteroids used. The aims of the study are to evaluate the prevalence
      and risk factors of severe coronavirus disease-2019 and the effect of
      inflammatory bowel disease drugs on severe coronavirus disease-2019. METHODS: In 
      this study among 1195 inflammatory bowel disease patients, 130 patients who were 
      found to be positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 between 
      March 2020 and May 2021 were evaluated. Patients were divided into 3 groups as
      mild, moderate, and severe coronavirus disease-2019. RESULTS: Among 130 patients,
      91 (70%) had mild, 16 (12.3%) had moderate, and 23 (17.7%) had severe coronavirus
      disease-2019. Being 60 years of age or older (P = .009), having at least 1
      comorbid disease (P = .002), and having active inflammatory bowel disease (P =
      .001) were factors that increased the risk for severe coronavirus disease-2019.
      The use of mesalazine (P = .35), biologic agents (P = .23), and corticosteroids
      (P = .42) did not increase the risk of severe coronavirus disease-2019. The use
      of azathioprine seemed to decrease the risk of severe disease with univariate
      regression analysis however the significance disappeared with multivariate
      analysis. CONCLUSION: Older age, active inflammatory bowel disease, and existence
      of at least 1 comorbid disease are risk factors for severe coro- navirus
      disease-2019. However, drugs used in inflammatory bowel disease management do not
      increase the risk of severe coronavirus disease-2019. But due to the small number
      of patients, it is difficult to reach a definite conclusion about
      corticosteroids.

TI  - The Generic BFRB Scale-8 (GBS-8): a transdiagnostic scale to measure the severity
      of body-focused repetitive behaviours.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1017/S1352465822000327 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Body-focused repetitive behaviours (BFRBs) such as skin picking and
      hair pulling are frequent but under-diagnosed and under-treated psychological
      conditions. As of now, most studies use symptom-specific BFRB scales. However, a 
      transdiagnostic scale is needed in view of the high co-morbidity of different
      BFRBs. AIMS: We aimed to assess the reliability as well as concurrent and
      divergent validity of a newly developed transdiagnostic BFRB scale. METHOD: For
      the first time, we administered the 8-item Generic BFRB Scale (GBS-8) as well as 
      the Repetitive Body Focused Behavior Scale (RBFBS), modified for adults, in 279
      individuals with BFRBs. The GBS-8 builds upon the Skin Picking Scale-Revised
      (SPS-R), but has been adapted to capture different BFRBs concurrently. A total of
      170 participants (61%) were re-assessed after 6 weeks to determine the
      test-retest reliability of the scale. RESULTS: Similar to the SPS-R, factor
      analysis yielded two dimensions termed symptom severity and impairment. The
      test-retest reliability of the scale was satisfactory (r = .72, p<.001).
      Concurrent validity (r = .74) with the RBFBS was good (correlational indexes for 
      concurrent validity were significantly higher than that for discriminant
      validity). DISCUSSION: The GBS-8 appears to be a reliable and valid global
      measure of BFRBs. We recommend usage of the scale in combination with specific
      BFRB scales to facilitate comparability across studies on obsessive-compulsive
      spectrum disorders.

TI  - Efficacy of leupeptin in treating ischemia in a rat hind limb model.
PG  - e15411
LID - 10.14814/phy2.15411 [doi]
AB  - Prolonged tourniquet use can lead to tissue ischemia and can cause progressive
      muscle and nerve injuries. Such injuries are accompanied by calpain activation
      and subsequent Wallerian-like degeneration. Several known inhibitors, including
      leupeptin, are known to impede the activity of calpain and associated tissue
      damage. We hypothesize that employment of leupeptin in a rat model of prolonged
      hind limb ischemia can mitigate muscle and nerve injuries. Sprague-Dawley rats (n
      = 10) weighing between 300-400 g were employed in this study. Their left hind
      limbs were subjected to blood flow occlusion for a period of 2-h using a neonatal
      blood pressure cuff. Five rats were given twice weekly intramuscular leupeptin
      injections, while the other five received saline. After 2 weeks, the animals were
      euthanized, their sciatic nerves and gastrocnemius muscles were harvested, fixed,
      stained, and analyzed using NIH Image J software. The administration of leupeptin
      resulted in larger gastrocnemius muscle fiber cross-sectional areas for the right
      (non-tourniquet applied) hindlimb as compared to that treated with the saline (p 
      = 0.0110). However, no statistically significant differences were found between
      these two groups for the injured left hindlimb (p = 0.1440). With regards to the 
      sciatic nerve cross-sectional areas and sciatic functional index, no differences 
      were detected between the leupeptin and control treated groups for both the
      healthy and injured hindlimbs. This research provides new insights on how to
      employ leupeptin to inhibit the degenerative effects of calpain and preserve
      tissues following ischemia resulting from orthopedic or plastic surgery
      procedures.

TI  - Comparison of Access Site Complications After Early or Late Sheath Removal in
      Patients with PCI, Regardless of ACT Levels.
PG  - 654-661
LID - 10.5152/AnatolJCardiol.2022.1733 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the lack of supporting data, many clinics perform sheath
      removal 4-6 hours after femoral percutaneous coronary intervention to reduce the 
      risk of possible access site complications. This study aims to examine the
      effects of sheath removal immediately after the procedure on access site
      complications and patient comfort. METHODS: This prospective study included 349
      patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention via the femoral site
      and 6 French guiding catheters. The sheath in the early group was removed
      immediately after the procedure without checking the activated clotting time
      levels but after 4 hours in the late group. Access site complications were
      recorded and patient comfort was evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale.
      RESULTS: Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients in the early removal group
      (n=171) and in the late removal group (n= 178). There was no statistically
      significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of access site
      complications. Three patients in the early removal group and 4 patients in the
      late removal group developed a hematoma. Six patients in the early removal group 
      and 10 patients in the late removal group showed
      ecchymosis.TheVisualAnalogScalescorewas statistically significantly lower
      intheearly removal group compared with that in the late removal group [2 (1-3)
      vs. 3 (2-4), P < .001]. CONCLUSION: This study shows that immediate sheath
      removal is safe and more comfortable for patients with percutaneous coronary
      intervention who received weightadjusted dose of heparin, regardless of the
      percutaneous coronary intervention levels after the procedure.

TI  - Evaluation of Left Ventricular Longitudinal, Radial, and Circumferential Strains 
      in Subjects with Normal Variations of Coronary Dominance: A Preliminary
      Comparative Study.
PG  - 645-653
LID - 10.5152/AnatolJCardiol.2022.1075 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the contractile function of the
      left ventricular muscles in subjects with normal coronary artery and normal
      variations of coronary dominance. METHODS: This study was performed on 90 adult
      subjects with normal results of coronary arteries angiography, echocardiography, 
      and electrocardiography. The participants were categorized into 3 groups of 30
      with right-dominant, left-dominant, and codominant variations. Two-dimensional
      transthoracic echocardiography was performed with apical 2-, 3-, and 4-chamber
      views and parasternal basal, mid, and apical short-axis views. Then, images were 
      analyzed offline using the velocity vector imaging method. In all studied groups,
      the mean and standard deviation of left ventricle coronary territorial
      longitudinal, circumferential, radial strains, and left ventricle global strains 
      were determined. They were compared in 3 layers of sub-endocardial, myocardium,
      and sub-epicardial. RESULTS: In terms of longitudinal and circumferential
      strains, there were significant differences in the most coronary territories and 
      global strain among the right-dominant, left-dominant and codominant groups (P < 
      .05). No significant differences in terms of territorial and global radial
      strains were observed among the study groups (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Strain level 
      decreased from endocardium to epicardium in all studied groups. Territorial and
      global contractile functions (longitudinal and circumferential strains) of the
      left ventricle vary depending on the variations of coronary arteries.

      Tomography in Out of Window Period Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction Patients.
PG  - 637-644

AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the accuracy of global longitudinal strain and
      territorial longitudinal strain in determining myocardial viability in comparison
      to single-photon emission computed tomography in out of window period anterior
      wall myocardial infarction patients. METHODS: This was a single-center,
      prospective study carried out in a tertiary care center in northern India. All
      patients presenting with anterior wall myocardial infarction-out of window period
      without ongoing chest pain and akinetic left-anterior descending territory on
      echocardiography were recruited. All patients underwent strain echocardiography
      and the determination of both global longitudinal strain and territorial
      longitudinal strain within 12-48 hours of anterior wall myocardial infarction. In
      addition, all underwent single-photon emission computed tomography to determine
      the viability status of the anterior myocardium. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients of
      anterior wall myocardial infarction-out of window period were enrolled and
      underwent strain imaging with speckle tracking and single-photon emission
      computed tomography for viability determination. Gobal longitudinal strain and
      territorial longitudinal strain were significantly reduced in patients with
      nonviable myocardium (P < .001). On receiver-operating curves, a gobal
      longitudinal strain of <10.45% had a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of
      93.9% (AUC=0.889) in predicting nonviability on single-photon emission computed
      tomography. Similarly, a territorial longitudinal strain of <7.60% had a
      sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 84.8% (AUC=0.825) in predicting
      nonviability. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment strategies in patients presenting with
      anterior wall myocardial infarction, outside the window period is largely guided 
      by the hemodynamic status and influenced by the viability status of the
      myocardium. Strain echocardiography using speckle tracking provides gobal
      longitudinal strain and territorial longitudinal strain, both of which have good 
      sensitivity and specificity in predicting viability and can be performed safely
      and quickly in high-risk group of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardioneuroablation is one of the emerging therapies in vasovagal
      syncope. In this study, we present a simple method of cardioneuroablation
      performed via a rightsided approach, targeting anterior-right and right-inferior 
      ganglionated plexi, along with procedural and follow-up data. METHODS: Patients
      who had underwent cardioneuroablation between March 2018 and September 2019 with 
      vasovagal syncope in 2 clinics were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent
      radio-anatomically guided radiofrequency ablation targeting anterior-right
      ganglionated plexi and right-inferior ganglionated plexi. Syncope and symptom
      burden, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram data at presentation, and at
      follow-up were assessed along with procedural data. RESULTS: A total of 23
      patients underwent modified right-sided cardioneuroablation. Mean basal cycle
      length decreased significantly from 862.3 +/- 174.5 ms at the beginning of the
      procedure 695.8 +/- 152.1 ms following the final radiofrequency ablation (P <
      .001). Mean 24-hour ambulatory heart rate increased significantly from 66.4 +/-
      10.7 bpm at baseline to 80 +/- 7.6 bpm at follow-up (P < .001). Only 1 patient
      had 1 episode of syncope following the procedure at the mean follow-up period of 
      10 +/- 2.9 months. The same patient had recurrent presyncope. CONCLUSION: The
      right-sided cardioneuroablation approach was found to be an effective treatment
      for vasovagal syncope and may be regarded as a default initial
      cardioneuroablation technique.

TI  - Age-Related Differences of Cortical Topology Across the Adult Lifespan: Evidence 
      From a Multisite MRI Study With 1427 Individuals.
LID - 10.1002/jmri.28318 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthy aging is usually accompanied by alterations in brain network 
      architecture, influencing information processing and cognitive performance.
      However, age-associated coordination patterns of morphological networks and
      cognitive variation are not well understood. PURPOSE: To investigate the
      age-related differences of cortical topology in morphological brain networks from
      multiple perspectives. STUDY TYPE: Prospective, observational multisite study.
      POPULATION: A total of 1427 healthy participants (59.1% female, 51.75 +/- 19.82
      years old) from public datasets. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5 T/3 T, T1-weighted 
      magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence. ASSESSMENT: The
      multimodal parcellation atlas was used to define regions of interest (ROIs). The 
      Jensen-Shannon divergence-based individual morphological networks were
      constructed by estimating the interregional similarity of cortical thickness
      distribution. Graph-theory based global network properties were then calculated, 
      followed by ROI analysis (including global/nodal topological analysis and hub
      analysis) with statistical tests. STATISTICAL TESTS: Chi-square test,
      Jensen-Shannon divergence-based similarity measurement, general linear model with
      false discovery rate correction. Significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The
      clustering coefficient (q = 0.016), global efficiency (q = 0.007), and
      small-worldness (q = 0.006) were significantly negatively quadratic correlated
      with age. The group-level hubs of seven age groups were found mainly distributed 
      in default mode network, visual network, salient network, and somatosensory motor
      network (the sum of these hubs' distribution in each group exceeds 55%). Further 
      ROI-wise analysis showed significant nodal trajectories of intramodular
      connectivities. DATA CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated the age-associated
      reconfiguration of morphological networks. Specifically, network
      segregation/integration had an inverted U-shaped relationship with age, which
      indicated age-related differences in transmission efficiency. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 2
      TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 1.

TI  - Effect of Transdermal Fentanyl Patch Combined with Enhanced Recovery after
      Surgery on the Curative Effect and Analgesic Effect of Liver Cancer.
PG  - 9722458
LID - 10.1155/2022/9722458 [doi]
AB  - Its goal was to see how a transdermal fentanyl patch combined with accelerated
      recovery after surgery (ERAS) affected the treatment efficacy and analgesic
      effect of liver cancer, as well as to help patients with liver cancer choose the 
      right analgesic treatment and nursing mode. 150 patients with liver cancer were
      divided into group A (transdermal fentanyl patch), group B (ERAS), and group C
      (transdermal fentanyl patch combined with ERAS). Patients in the three groups
      were compared in terms of pain, survival, psychological status, adverse
      responses, postoperative recovery, and patient satisfaction. The results showed
      that under different treatment and nursing methods, the number of patients with
      mild cancer pain in the three groups was increased, especially the number of
      patients with mild cancer pain in group C (P < 0.05). Besides, the quality of
      life score of patients in each group was decreased. Patients who received the
      combination analgesia had a significantly higher quality of life than those who
      received simply a transdermal fentanyl patch or ERAS (P < 0.05). The scores of
      both the Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) and Hamilton depression rating scale
      (HAMD) of patients with the combined analgesia were decreased signally (P <
      0.05). There were few patients with combined analgesia who had adverse reactions 
      (P < 0.05). After surgery, the time of the first anal exhaust, first defecation, 
      and first ambulation in group C were shorter than those in the other two groups
      (P < 0.05). To summarize, combining the two techniques aided in the recovery of
      gastrointestinal function as well as the physical recovery of patients following 
      surgery. Furthermore, combining the two approaches produced a clear analgesic
      impact, which could improve patients' quality of life while also having a
      favorable clinical adoption effect.

      Exposed Population under Sudden Public Health Crisis.
PG  - 3411960
LID - 10.1155/2022/3411960 [doi]
AB  - Background: After the occurrence of public health emergencies, people will have a
      series of physiological reactions, which will develop into psychological stress
      disorder in serious cases. Based on this, the purpose of this study is to analyze
      the psychological stress response and intervention countermeasures of exposed
      people under sudden public health crisis. Objective: To explore the psychological
      stress response and intervention countermeasures of exposed population under
      sudden public health crisis. Methods: A total of 400 people under the sudden
      public health crisis that bring about serious damage to public health, mass
      diseases of unknown causes, major food and occupational poisoning, and other
      events that seriously affect public health from December 2020 to December 2021
      were selected as the subjects of the study. It was randomly and equally divided
      into two groups to take different intervention measures, the control group was
      given routine public health crisis intervention measures, and the research group 
      was given comprehensive intervention. The metabolism, social function defects,
      health symptoms, psychological status, quality of life, sleep quality, and stress
      reaction were compared between the two groups. Results: The rate of good
      metabolism in the research group was significantly higher than that in the
      control group (P < 0.05). After intervention, the scores of Social Disability
      Screening Schedule (SDSS) and Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) decreased in both
      groups, and the scores of SDSS and SCL-90 in the research group were lower than
      those in the control group. After intervention, the scores of self-rating
      depression scale and self-rating anxiety scale in the two groups decreased, and
      the scores of self-rating depression scale and self-rating anxiety scale in the
      research group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The sleep
      quality of the research group was better than that of the control group (P <
      0.05). The stress response indexes such as cortisol, blood glucose, and
      C-reactive protein in the two groups were decreased after intervention. The
      stress response indexes such as cortisol, blood glucose, and C-reactive protein
      in the research group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05).
      Conclusion: Giving that comprehensive intervention measures to people exposed to 
      sudden public health crisis can effectively relax their stress response,
      reinvigorate their quality of life and sleep, reduce depression and anxiety, and 
      improve their metabolism, therefore, in the case of the outbreak of public health
      crisis in the future, it is worth applying for reference and popularizing.

      Proteins in Cattle and Buffalo.
PG  - 5893825
LID - 10.1155/2022/5893825 [doi]
AB  - The somatotropic axis consists of genes associated with economic traits like
      muscle growth and carcass traits in livestock. Insulin-like growth factor binding
      proteins (IGFBPs) are the major proteins that play a vital role in the
      somatotropic axis. The present study performed a genome-wide characterization of 
      IGFBP genes in cattle. Genomic sequences of the IGFBP gene family for different
      mammals (cattle, buffalo, goat, and sheep) were recovered from the NCBI database.
      Sequence analyses were performed to investigate cattle's genomic variations in
      the IGFBP gene family. Phylogenetic analysis, gene structure, motif patterns, and
      conserved domain analysis (CDA) of the IGFBP family revealed the evolutionarily
      conserved nature of the IGFBP genes in cattle and other studied species.
      Physicochemical properties of IGFBP proteins in cattle revealed that most of
      these proteins are unstable, hydrophilic, thermostable, and acidic. Comparative
      amino acid analysis revealed variations in all protein sequences with single
      indels in IGFBP3 and IGFBP6. Mutation analysis revealed only one nonsynonymous
      mutation D212 > E in the IGFBP6 protein of cattle. A total of 245 nuclear hormone
      receptor (NHRs) sites were detected, including 139 direct repeats (DR), 65
      everted repeats (ER), and 41 inverted repeats (IR). Out of 133 transcription
      factors (TFs), 10 TFs (AHR, AHRARNT, AP4, CMYB, E47, EGR2, GATA, SP1, and SRF)
      had differential distribution (P value < 0.05) of putative transcriptional
      binding sites (TFBS) in cattle compared to buffalo. Synteny analysis revealed the
      conserved nature of genes between cattle and buffalo. Two gene pairs
      (IGFBP1/IGFBP3 and IGFBP2/IGFBP5) showed tandem duplication events in cattle and 
      buffalo. This study highlights the functional importance of genomic variation in 
      IGFBP genes and necessitates further investigations better to understand the role
      and mechanisms of IGFBPs in bovines.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aimed to develop gefitinib-loaded solid lipid
      nanoparticles (GEF-SLN), and GEF-loaded PEGylated SLN (GEF-P-SLN) for targeting
      metastatic lung cancer through the lymphatic system. Methods: The prepared SLNs
      were characterized in terms of physicochemical properties, entrapment efficiency,
      and in-vitro release. Furthermore, ex-vivo permeability was investigated using
      the rabbit intestine. Cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects were studied against
      A549 cell lines as a model for lung cancer. Results: The present results revealed
      that the particle size and polydispersity index of the prepared formulations
      range from 114 to 310 nm and 0.066 to 0.350, respectively, with negative
      zeta-potential (-14 to -27.6). Additionally, SLN and P-SLN showed remarkable
      entrapment efficiency above 89% and exhibited sustained-release profiles. The
      permeability study showed that GEF-SLN and GEF-P-SLN enhanced the permeability of
      GEF by 1.71 and 2.64-fold, respectively, compared with GEF suspension.
      Cytotoxicity showed that IC50 of pure GEF was 3.5 mug/mL, which decreased to 1.95
      and 1.8 mug/mL for GEF-SLN and GEF-P-SLN, respectively. Finally, the apoptotic
      study revealed that GEF-P-SLN decreased the number of living cells from 49.47 to 
      3.43 when compared with pure GEF. Conclusion: These results concluded that
      GEF-P-SLN is a promising approach to improving the therapeutic outcomes of GEF in
      the treatment of metastatic lung cancer.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2-Specific Adaptive Immunity in COVID-19 Survivors With Asthma.
PG  - 947724
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.947724 [doi]
AB  - Background: Asthma patients potentially have impaired adaptive immunity to virus 
      infection. The levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immunity between COVID-19
      survivors with and without asthma are presently unclear. Methods: COVID-19
      survivors (patients with asthma n=11, with allergies n=8, and COVID-19 only n=17)
      and non-COVID-19 individuals (asthmatic patients n=10 and healthy controls n=9)
      were included. The COVID-19 patients were followed up at about 8 months and 16
      months after discharge. The clinical characteristics, lymphocyte subsets, memory 
      T cells, and humoral immunity including SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies,
      SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, and memory B cells were
      analyzed in these subjects. Results: The strength of virus-specific T cell
      response in COVID-19 survivors was positively correlated with the percentage of
      blood eosinophils and Treg cells (r=0.4007, p=0.0188; and r=0.4435, p=0.0086
      respectively) at 8-month follow-up. There were no statistical differences in the 
      levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response between the COVID-19 survivors
      with, and without, asthma. Compared to those without asthma, the COVID-19 with
      asthma survivors had higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies
      (NAbs) at the 8-month follow-up (p<0.05). Moreover, the level of NAbs in COVID-19
      survivors was positively correlated with the percentage of Treg and cTfh2 cells
      (r=0.5037, p=0.002; and r=0.4846, p=0.0141), and negatively correlated with the
      percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells (r=-0.5701, p=0.0003; and r=-0.3656, p=0.0308), 
      the ratio of Th1/Th2, Th17/Treg, and cTfh1/cTfh2 cell (r=-0.5356, r=-0.5947,
      r=-0.4485; all p<0.05). The decay rate of NAbs in the COVID-19 survivors with
      asthma was not significantly different from that of those without asthma at
      16-month follow-up. Conclusion: The level of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs in COVID-19
      survivors with asthma was higher than that of those without asthma at 8-month
      follow-up. The SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity was associated with blood
      eosinophils and Treg percentages. The SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity was
      closely associated with cTfh2/cTfh1 imbalance and Treg/Th17 ratio. According to
      the findings, asthmatic patients in COVID-19 convalescent period may benefit from
      an enhanced specific humoral immunity, which associates with skewed Th2/Th1 and
      Treg/Th17 immune.

LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.930956 [doi]
AB  - Individuals infected with P. falciparum develop antibody responses to
      intra-erythrocytic gametocyte proteins and exported gametocyte proteins present
      on the surface of infected erythrocytes. However, there is currently limited
      knowledge on the immunogenicity of gametocyte antigens and the specificity of
      gametocyte-induced antibody responses. In this study, we assessed antibody
      responses in participants of two controlled human malaria infection (CHMI)
      studies by ELISA, multiplexed bead-based antibody assays and protein microarray. 
      By comparing antibody responses in participants with and without gametocyte
      exposure, we aimed to disentangle the antibody response induced by asexual and
      sexual stage parasites. We showed that after a single malaria infection, a
      significant anti-sexual stage humoral response is induced in malaria-naive
      individuals, even after exposure to relatively low gametocyte densities (up to
      ~1,600 gametocytes/mL). In contrast to antibody responses to well-characterised
      asexual blood stage antigens that were detectable by day 21 after infection,
      responses to sexual stage antigens (including transmission blocking vaccine
      candidates Pfs48/45 and Pfs230) were only apparent at 51 days after infection. We
      found antigens previously associated with early gametocyte or anti-gamete
      immunity were highly represented among responses linked with gametocyte exposure.
      Our data provide detailed insights on the induction and kinetics of antibody
      responses to gametocytes and identify novel antigens that elicit antibody
      responses exclusively in individuals with gametocyte exposure. Our findings
      provide target identification for serological assays for surveillance of the
      malaria infectious reservoir, and support vaccine development by describing the
      antibody response to leading vaccine antigens after primary infection.

TI  - Multi-organ Immune-Related Adverse Event Is a Risk Factor of Immune Checkpoint
      Inhibitor-Associated Myocarditis in Cancer Patients: A Multi-center Study.
PG  - 879900
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.879900 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objective: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated
      myocarditis is a fatal immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which is prone to
      affecting multiple organ systems. Multi-organ irAEs have not been fully studied
      in ICI-associated myocarditis. Therefore, we aimed to explore the impact of
      multi-organ irAEs on ICI myocarditis in terms of clinical features, treatment,
      and prognosis. Methods: This was a retrospective study. The clinical data of ICI 
      myocarditis patients were collected from 6 hospitals in China. The risk factors
      and characteristics of pure myocarditis and multi-organ irAEs were analyzed. The 
      overall survival (OS) after myocarditis was analyzed and univariate and
      multivariate regression analysis were performed. Results: A total of 46 patients 
      were analyzed in this study. Multi-organ irAEs were common (30/46, 65.2%) and
      prone to severe heart failure. The severe myocarditis was observed in 32 patients
      (69.6%). When myocarditis occurred, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive
      protein, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, creatine kinase, MB
      isoenzyme of creatine kinase, and brain natriuretic peptide increased from
      baseline, but absolute lymphocyte count decreased. Thymoma (B2/B3) was a risk
      factor for multi-organ irAEs. Heart failure and myocarditis were more severe in
      patients with multi-organ irAEs and require early corticosteroid therapy (<24
      hours). Univariate analysis showed that age >/= 60 years, myocarditis (grade
      3-4), heart failure (grade 3-4), multi-organ irAEs, and severe myocarditis were
      associated with OS after myocarditis. After adjusting for other factors, heart
      failure (grade 3-4) was an independent risk factor for immune-related myocarditis
      (HR: 6.655, 95% CI: 1.539-28.770, p=0.011). Conclusion: Patients with
      ICI-associated myocarditis had multi-organ irAEs with a high incidence of severe 
      myocarditis, mortality, and poor prognosis. Thymoma was prone to those patients
      with multiple organs involvement. Patients could benefit from early
      corticosteroid intervention. Heart failure (grade 3-4) was an independent risk
      factor for OS after myocarditis.

AB  - Background: Exosome circRNAs (Exo-circRNAs) regulate cancer progression and
      intercellular crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment. However, their biological 
      functions and potential clinical importance in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain
      unknown. Methods: We used exoRBase 2.0 data to identify significant
      differentially expressed Exo-circRNAs (Exo-DEcircRNAs) in CRC patients and
      healthy individuals. The least absolute shrinkage and selector operation
      algorithm, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination, and multivariate
      Cox regression analyses were used to select candidate Exo-circRNAs and
      constructed a diagnostic model. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
      chain reaction analysis was performed to confirm the expression of Exo-circRNAs
      in the serum samples of patients. Furthermore, we constructed an exosome
      circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network for CRC. Upregulated target mRNAs in the exosome
      competing endogenous RNA (Exo-ceRNA) network were used for functional and pathway
      enrichment analyses. We identified 22 immune cell types in CRC patients using
      CIBERSORT. Correlation analysis revealed the relationship between Exo-ceRNA
      networks and immune-infiltrating cells. The relationship between target mRNAs and
      immunotherapeutic response was also explored. Finally, using the Kaplan-Meier
      survival curve, a prognostic upregulated target mRNA was screened. We constructed
      a survival-related Exo-ceRNA subnetwork and explored the correlation between the 
      Exo-ceRNA subnetwork and immune-infiltrating cells. Results: The constructed
      diagnostic model had a high area under the curve (AUC) value in both the training
      and validation sets (AUC = 0.744 and AUC = 0.741, respectively). qRT-PCR
      confirmed that the Exo-circRNAs were differentially expressed in CRC serum
      samples. We constructed Exo-ceRNA networks based on the interactions among seven 
      upregulated Exo-DEcircRNAs, eight differentially expressed miRNAs, and twenty-two
      differentially expressed mRNAs in CRC. Functional enrichment analysis revealed
      that the upregulated target mRNAs were significantly enriched in cytoskeletal
      motor activity and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Co-expression analysis showed 
      a significant correlation between the Exo-ceRNA networks and immune cells. The
      significant correlation was observed between target mRNAs and the
      immunotherapeutic response. Additionally, based on the prognostic upregulated
      target gene (RGS2), we constructed a survival-related Exo-ceRNA subnetwork
      (Exosome hsa_circ_0050334-hsa_miR_182_5p-RGS2). CIBERSORT results revealed that
      the Exo-ceRNA subnetwork correlated with M2 macrophages (P = 4.6e-07, R = 0.31). 
      Conclusions: Our study identified an Exo-diagnostic model, established Exo-ceRNA 
      networks, and explored the correlation between Exo-ceRNA networks and immune cell
      infiltration in CRC. These findings elucidated the biological functions of
      Exo-circRNAs and their potential clinical implications.

TI  - A Novel Prognostic Risk Model for Cervical Cancer Based on Immune Checkpoint
      HLA-G-Driven Differentially Expressed Genes.
PG  - 851622
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.851622 [doi]
AB  - Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is a potential checkpoint molecule that plays a
      key role in cervical carcinogenesis. The purpose of this study was to construct
      and validate a prognostic risk model to predict the overall survival (OS) of
      cervical cancer patients, providing a reference for individualized clinical
      treatment that may lead to better clinical outcomes. HLA-G-driven differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from two cervical carcinoma cell lines,
      namely, SiHa and HeLa, with stable overexpression of HLA-G by RNA sequencing
      (RNA-seq). The biological functions of these HLA-G-driven DEGs were analysed by
      GO enrichment and KEGG pathway using the "clusterProfiler" package. The
      protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were assessed using the STRING database. The 
      prognostic relevance of each DEG was evaluated by univariate Cox regression using
      the TCGA-CESC dataset. After the TCGA-CESC cohort was randomly divided into
      training set and testing set, and a prognostic risk model was constructed by
      LASSO and stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis in training set and
      validated in testing set or in different types of cervical cancer set. The
      predictive ability of the prognostic risk model or nomogram was evaluated by a
      series of bioinformatics methods. A total of 1108 candidate HLA-G-driven DEGs,
      including 391 upregulated and 717 downregulated genes, were obtained and were
      enriched mostly in the ErbB pathway, steroid biosynthesis, and MAPK pathway.
      Then, an HLA-G-driven DEG signature consisting of the eight most important
      prognostic genes CD46, LGALS9, PGM1, SPRY4, CACNB3, PLIN2, MSMO1, and DAGLB was
      identified as a key predictor of cervical cancer. Multivariate Cox regression
      analysis showed that this signature is an independent risk factor for the overall
      survival of CESC patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the 5-year 
      overall survival rate is 23.0% and 84.6% for the high-risk and low-risk patients,
      respectively (P<0.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of this
      prognostic model with an area under the curve (AUC) was 0.896 for 5 years, which 
      was better than that of other clinical traits. This prognostic risk model was
      also successfully validated in different subtypes of cervical cancer, including
      the keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, non-keratinizing squamous cell
      carcinoma, squamous cell neoplasms, non-squamous cell neoplasms set.
      Single-sample gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) algorithm and Tumor Immune Dysfunction
      and Exclusion (TIDE) analysis confirmed that this signature influence tumour
      microenvironment and immune checkpoint blockade. A nomogram that integrated risk 
      score, age, clinical stage, histological grade, and pathological type was then
      built to predict the overall survival of CESC patients and evaluated by
      calibration curves, AUC, concordance index (C-index) and decision curve analysis 
      (DCA). To summarize, we developed and validated a novel prognostic risk model for
      cervical cancer based on HLA-G-driven DEGs, and the prognostic signature showed
      great ability in predicting the overall survival of patients with cervical
      cancer.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease risk factors play a critical role in brain
      aging. The metabolic syndrome (MetS), a constellation of cardiovascular risk
      factors, has been associated with poorer cognition in old age; however, it is
      unclear if it is connected to brain health earlier in life. Methods: We
      investigated the association of MetS (n = 534, 18.5%) vs. no MetS (n = 2,346,
      81.5%) with cognition in midlife within the prospective study, Coronary Artery
      Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA). At midlife (mean age 50), MetS was
      defined using National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. At the 5-year
      follow-up, a cognitive battery was administered including tests of processing
      speed (Digit Symbol Substitution Test, DSST), executive function (the Stroop
      Test), verbal memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, RAVLT), verbal fluency
      (category and letter fluency), and global cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive 
      Assessment, MoCA). A sub-sample (n = 453) underwent brain MRI. Results:
      Participants with MetS had worse performance on tests of verbal fluency,
      processing speed, executive function, and verbal memory (p < 0.05), but not on
      global cognition. MetS was also associated with lower frontal, parietal,
      temporal, and total white matter integrity (p < 0.05), as assessed with
      fractional anisotropy. Conclusions: MetS is associated with lower cognition and
      microstructural brain alterations already at midlife, suggesting that MetS should
      be targeted earlier in life in order to prevent adverse brain and cognitive
      outcomes.

      Coronary Artery Disease: A Relationship With Endocrine and Inflammatory
      Biomarkers.
PG  - 899597
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2022.899597 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Our exploratory study aimed to determine whether obstructive sleep 
      apnoea (OSA) could affect cognitive functioning in males with coronary artery
      disease (CAD), and whether such impact could be associated with changes in
      thyroid hormones and inflammatory marker regulation on cognitive functioning.
      Method: We evaluated different endocrine and inflammatory biomarkers, including
      free triiodothyronine [fT3], free tetraiodothyronine [fT4], N-terminal pro-B-type
      natriuretic peptide [NT-pro-BNP], and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
      [hs-CRP] serum levels in 328 males ( x = 57 +/- 10 years), undergoing cardiac
      rehabilitation after an acute coronary event. Participants underwent full-night
      polysomnography and were classified in mild/non-OSA (n = 253) and OSA (n = 75)
      according to an apnoea-hypopnoea index >/= 15 event/h. Cognitive functioning
      testing included the Digit Span Test, Digit Symbol Test (DSST), and Trail Making 
      Test. Analyses of variance assessed the impact of OSA on cognitive functioning
      and possible relationships of fT3/fT4, NT-pro-BNP and with hs-CRP on cognitive
      measures. Results: Significant group (OSA, mild/non-OSA) x NT-pro-BNP (<157.0 vs.
      >/=157.0, ng/L) interactions were found for the DSST raw score (F (2,324) = 3.58,
      p = 0.014). Decomposition of interactions showed that the DSST scores of the OSA 
      group with NT-pro-BNP >/= 157.0 ng/L (M = 33.2; SD = 8.1) were significantly
      lower, p = 0.031, than those of the mild/non-OSA with NT-pro-BNP < 157.0 ng/L (M 
      = 37.7; SD = 8.9). Conclusion: These findings indicate that males with OSA and
      clinically elevated NT-pro-BNP levels experienced inferior psychomotor
      performance compared to those without OSA and reduced NT-pro-BNP levels.

TI  - Does endovascular duration impact clinical outcomes in aortic arch repair? The
      RELAY branched international stance.
PG  - 969858
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.969858 [doi]
AB  - Background: The high mortality and morbidity rates in surgical aortic arch repair
      are a barrier to therapy for a considerable proportion of patients with aortic
      arch aneurysm or dissection. There is hence a demand for the development and
      adoption of a minimally invasive alternative to aortic arch repair, such as
      thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Procedural duration is a key factor 
      in the pathogenesis of complications in surgical aortic arch repair. Herein, we
      evaluate whether endovascular duration impacts neurological outcomes, target
      vessel patency, and reintervention rates in aortic arch TEVAR with RELAY Branched
      (Terumo Aortic, Inchinnan, UK), which is specifically developed for on-label use 
      within the aortic arch. Methods: Prospective data was collected between January
      2019 and January 2022 on the clinical outcomes of TEVAR for aortic arch
      dissection and aneurysm with RELAY single-, double-, and triple branched
      endoprostheses from centers across Europe. They were then retrospectively
      analyzed with descriptive and distributive analysis. Follow-up data on the
      incidence of disabling stroke (DS), target vessel patency, and reintervention
      from 30 days and 6-, 12-, and 24 months postoperative was included in the
      analysis. Results: 147 (99.3%) of all 148 cases were successful. Over the 24
      month follow-up period, in total 6 (4.1%) patients suffered DS, 24 (16.3%)
      required reintervention, and target vessel patency was exhibited in 118 (80.2%)
      patients. The modal endovascular duration was 100-150 min (in 64.6%, n = 95
      cases). Analysis revealed that endovascular duration was associated with a lower 
      likelihood of reintervention at 30 days, 6-, and 12 months (P = 0.011, P = 0.019,
      P = 0.037), a greater likelihood of target vessel patency at 6- and 24 months (P 
      = 0.032, P = 0.035). No relationship between endovascular duration and DS was
      revealed. Discussion: The data demonstrates that RELAY Branched is associated
      with promising clinical outcomes for on-label aortic arch TEVAR. The underlying
      mechanism linking endovascular duration and reintervention rates, or target
      vessel patency is likely multifactorial and complex. Given that TEVAR is carried 
      out under general anesthetic only, it is unlikely that prolonged procedural
      duration has any major effect over neurological outcomes for arch TEVAR.

PG  - 869104
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.869104 [doi]
AB  - Background: Singing is a physical activity involving components of the vagal
      nerves manifested as changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. Aims: The aim of
      this pilot study is to investigate the acute effects of singing on biomarkers of 
      cardiovascular health. Methods: Adult subjects were recruited from cardiology
      clinics to participate in a single 90-min study visit. Vascular function was
      measured at the fingertips with peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) before and
      after singing to a 14-min video led by a voice expert. Heart rate variability
      (HRV) was measured with a chest strap sensor at baseline, during, and after
      singing. PAT measurements were expressed as reactive hyperemia index (RHI) and
      Framingham reactive hyperemia index (fRHI). Measures of HRV included root mean
      square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD) and standard deviation of NN
      (or RR) intervals (SDNN). Results: Sixty subjects completed the study (68%
      female, mean age 61 +/-13 years, mean BMI 32 +/- 8). There was a significant
      increase in fRHI (1.88 +/- 0.14 to 2.10 +/- 0.14, p = 0.02) after singing with no
      significant change in the RHI (1.99 +/- 0.10 to 2.12 +/- 0.09, p = 0.22). There
      was a reduction in HRV during singing (compared to baseline) (RMSSD: 42.0 +/- 5
      to 32.6 +/- 4, p = 0.004 and SDNN: 54 +/- 4 to 33.5 +/- 3, p = 0.009). HRV
      measures trended back toward baseline after singing. Conclusions: A short
      duration of singing improved vascular function acutely. Improvements were more
      substantial in subjects with abnormal baseline endothelial function. HRV patterns
      were similar to that of light-intensity exercise. Future studies should confirm
      favorable vascular adaptation to more sustained singing interventions. Clinical
      trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifer: NCT03805529.

TI  - Simulation-based Assessment to Measure Proficiency in Mechanical Ventilation
      among Residents.
PG  - 204-219
LID - 10.34197/ats-scholar.2021-0130OC [doi]
AB  - Background: Mechanical ventilation (MV) skills are essential for clinicians
      caring for critically ill patients, yet few training programs use structured
      curricula and appropriate assessments. Objective structured clinical exams
      (OSCEs) have been used to assess clinical competency in many areas, but there are
      no OSCE models focused on MV. Objective: To develop and validate a
      simulation-based assessment (SBA) with an OSCE structure to assess baseline MV
      competence among residents and identify knowledge gaps. Methods: We developed an 
      SBA using a lung simulator and a mechanical ventilator, and an OSCE structure,
      with six clinical scenarios in MV. We included internal medicine residents at the
      beginning of their rotation in the respiratory intensive care unit (ICU) of a
      university-affiliated hospital. A subset of residents was also evaluated with a
      validated multiple-choice exam (MCE) at the beginning and at the end of the ICU
      rotation. Scores on both assessments were normalized to range from 0 to 10. We
      used Cronbach's alpha coefficient to assess reliability and Spearman correlation 
      to estimate the correlation between the SBA and the MCE. Results: We included 80 
      residents, of whom 42 also completed the MCE examinations. The final version of
      the SBA had 32 items, and the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.72 (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.81). The average SBA score was 6.2 +/- 1.3, and 
      performance was variable across items, with 80% correctly adjusting initial
      ventilatory settings and only 12% correctly identifying asynchrony. The MCE had
      24 questions, and the average score was 7.6 +/- 2.4 at the beginning of the
      rotation and 8.2 +/- 2.3 at the end of the rotation (increase of 0.6 points; 95% 
      CI, 0.30-0.90; P < 0.001). There was moderate correlation between the SBA and the
      MCE (rho = 0.41; P = 0.002). Conclusion: We developed and validated an objective 
      structured assessment on MV using a pulmonary simulator and a mechanical
      ventilator addressing the main competencies in MV. The performance of residents
      in the SBA at the beginning of an ICU rotation was lower than the performance in 
      MCE, highlighting the need for greater emphasis on practical skills in MV during 
      residency.

LID - 10.34197/ats-scholar.2021-0114IN [doi]
AB  - Background: Prevention of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) in critically ill
      patients requires interprofessional collaboration among physicians, physical
      therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and
      nutritionists. Interprofessional education promotes interprofessional
      collaborative practice, yet formalized interprofessional education during
      residency is uncommon. Objective: We sought to improve internal medicine
      residents' knowledge of interprofessional roles in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
      and confidence in managing PICS by designing a virtual multimodal training
      module. Methods: We created a 3-hour virtual module with physical therapy,
      occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and nutrition experts. First,
      learners reviewed PICS and multidisciplinary interventions to optimize patient
      recovery. Second, attendees watched videos created by physical therapy and
      occupational therapy colleagues demonstrating mobility strategies to manage
      ICU-acquired weakness and delirium. Third, participants learned how
      speech-language pathology experts evaluate and manage swallowing disorders.
      Finally, attendees identified common nutritional therapy challenges with a trivia
      session. Participants completed pre- and postcourse assessments. Results:
      Thirty-four residents completed both pre- and postcourse assessments (52%
      response rate). The mean objective assessment score improved from 51% to 79% (P <
      0.001). All respondents reported that their knowledge of PICS increased, and
      almost all (97%) believed that their knowledge of interprofessional roles
      increased. Respondents' confidence in facilitating discussions about critical
      illness recovery significantly improved, from 77% rating as either not very
      confident or not at all confident before the course to 94% rating as somewhat
      confident or very confident after the course (P < 0.001). Conclusion: This
      single-site pilot study suggests that integrating interprofessional training in
      PICS education using virtual platforms may improve residents' knowledge of
      interprofessional roles in the ICU and confidence in managing PICS.

TI  - Development of a Standardized Assessment of Simulation-based Extracorporeal
      Membrane Oxygenation Educational Courses.

AB  - Background: In 2020, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization education task 
      force identified seven extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) educational
      domains that would benefit from international collaborative efforts. These
      included research efforts to delineate the impact and outcomes of ECMO courses.
      Objective: Development of a standardized online assessment tool to evaluate the
      effectiveness of didactic and simulation-based ECMO courses on participants'
      confidence, knowledge, and simulation-based skills; participant satisfaction; and
      course educational benefits. Methods: We performed a prospective multicenter
      observational study of five different U.S. academic institution-based adult ECMO 
      courses that met Extracorporeal Life Support Organization endorsement
      requirements for course structure, educational content, and objectives.
      Standardized online forms were developed and administered before and after
      courses, assessing demographics, self-assessment regarding ECMO management, and
      knowledge examination (15 simple-recall multiple-choice questions). Psychomotor
      skill assessment was performed during the course (time to complete prespecified
      critical actions during simulation scenarios). Self-assessment evaluated
      cognitive, behavioral, and technical aspects of ECMO; course satisfaction; and
      educational benefits. Results: Out of 211 participants, 107 completed both pre-
      and postcourse self-assessment forms (97 completed both pre- and postcourse
      knowledge forms). Fifty-three percent of respondents were physician intensivists,
      with most (51%) practicing at academic hospitals and with less than 1 year of
      ECMO experience (50%). After the course, participants reported significant
      increases in confidence across all domains (cognitive, technical, and behavioral,
      P < 0.0001, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.5; P < 0.0001, 95% CI, 2.2-2.6;
      and P = 0.002, 95% CI, 1.7-2.1, respectively) with an increase in knowledge
      scores (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 1.4-2.5). These findings were most significant in
      participants with less ECMO experience. There were also significant reductions in
      times to critical actions in three of the four scored simulation scenarios. The
      results demonstrated participants' satisfaction with most course aspects, with
      more than 95% expressing that courses met their educational goals. Conclusion: We
      developed and tested a structured ECMO course assessment tool, demonstrating
      participants' self-reported benefit as well as improvement in psychomotor skill
      acquisition, course satisfaction, and educational benefits. Course evaluation is 
      feasible and potentially provides important information to improve ECMO courses. 
      Future steps could include national implementation, addition of questions
      targeting clinical decision making to further assess knowledge gain, and
      multilanguage translation for implementation in international courses.

AB  - Background: Evidence shows poor adherence to strategies for reducing morbidity
      and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving mechanical
      ventilation globally. Best practice management relies on training all members of 
      the interprofessional ICU team, each with complementary roles in patient
      management. Objectives: To develop and evaluate a novel two-phase,
      train-the-trainer, interprofessional and multicultural "Best Practice Management 
      of the Ventilated ICU Patient" multimodality, simulation-enhanced curriculum for 
      Thai education leaders in critical care. Methods: In phase 1 (Oregon Health and
      Science University cohort), two groups of nine ICU nurses and one critical care
      physician representing experts in critical care and education from a large
      hospital system in Thailand participated in a weeklong, immersive course
      consisting of didactic, simulation, and in situ immersive sessions focused on
      best practice management of mechanically ventilated ICU patients, as well as
      training in our educational techniques. Outcomes were assessed with pre- and
      postcourse knowledge assessments and overall course evaluation. In phase 2 (Thai 
      cohort), participants from phase 1 returned to Thailand and implemented a lower
      fidelity curriculum in two hospitals, using the same pre- and posttest knowledge 
      assessment in 41 participants, before the onset of the coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) 6 pandemic. Results: In the Oregon Health and Science University
      cohort, the mean pretest knowledge score was 58.4 +/- 13.2%, with a mean
      improvement to 82.5 +/- 11.6% after completion of the course (P , 0.05). The
      greatest improvements were seen in respiratory physiology and
      advanced/disease-specific concepts, which demonstrated absolute improvements of
      30.4% and 30.6%, respectively (P < 0.05). Participants had a high degree of
      satisfaction, with 90% rating the course as "excellent" and .90% reporting that
      the course "greatly improved" their understanding of best practices and comfort
      in managing mechanical ventilation. The Thai cohort had a mean baseline score of 
      45.4 +/- 15.0% and a mean improvement to 70.3 +/- 19.1% after training (P <
      0.05). This cohort also saw the greatest improvement in respiratory physiology
      and advanced/disease-specific concepts, with 26.2% and 26.3% absolute
      improvements, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusion: A novel, two-phase,
      interprofessional, multicultural, simulation-enhanced train-the-trainer
      curriculum was feasible and effective in improving education in best practice
      management of mechanically ventilated patients and may be a useful model for
      improving the care of ICU patients across the world.

      Skills.
PG  - 258-269
LID - 10.34197/ats-scholar.2021-0046OC [doi]
AB  - Background: Currently there is no consensus on ideal teaching method to train
      novice trainees in EBUS. Simulation-based procedure training allows direct
      observation of trainees in a controlled environment without compromising patient 
      safety. Objective: We wanted to develop a comprehensive assessment of
      endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) performance of pulmonary fellows and assess the
      impact of a multimodal simulation-based curriculum for EBUS-guided transbronchial
      needle aspiration. Methods: Pretest assessment of 11 novice pulmonary fellows was
      performed using a three-part assessment tool, measuring EBUS-related knowledge,
      self-confidence, and procedural skills. Knowledge was assessed by 20
      multiple-choice questions. Self-confidence was measured using the previously
      validated EBUS-Subjective Assessment Tool. Procedural skills assessment was
      performed on Simbionix BRONCH Express simulator and was modeled on a previously
      validated EBUS-Skills and Task Assessment Tool (EBUS-STAT), to create a modified 
      EBUS-STAT based on internal faculty input via the Delphi method. After baseline
      testing, fellows participated in a structured multimodal curriculum, which
      included simulator training, small-group didactics, and interactive problem-based
      learning sessions, followed by individual debriefing sessions. Posttest
      assessment using the same three-part assessment tool was performed after 3
      months, and the results were compared to study the impact of the new curriculum. 
      Results: The mean knowledge score improved significantly from baseline to
      posttest (52.7% vs. 67.7%; P = 0.002). The mean EBUS-Subjective Assessment Tool
      confidence scores (maximum score, 50) improved significantly from baseline to
      posttest (26 +/- 7.6 vs. 35.2 +/- 6.3 points; P < 0.001). The mean modified
      EBUS-STAT (maximum score, 105) improved significantly from baseline to posttest
      (44.8 +/- 10.6 [42.7%] vs. 65.3 +/- 11.4 [62.2%]; P < 0.001). There was a
      positive correlation (r = 0.81) between the experience of the test participants
      and the modified EBUS-STAT scores. Conclusion: This study suggests a multimodal
      simulation-based curriculum can significantly improve EBUS-guided transbronchial 
      needle aspiration-related knowledge, self-confidence, and procedural skills among
      novice pulmonary fellows. A validation study is needed to determine if skills
      attained via a simulator can be replicated in a clinical setting.

TI  - Cocreating the ICU-PAUSE Tool for Intensive Care Unit-Ward Transitions.
PG  - 312-323
LID - 10.34197/ats-scholar.2021-0135IN [doi]
AB  - Background: Intensive care unit (ICU)-ward patient transfers are inherently high 
      risk, and clinician miscommunication has been linked to adverse events and
      negative outcomes. Despite these risks, few educational tools exist to improve
      resident handoff communication at ICU-ward transfer. Objective: We used
      human-centered design (HCD) methods to cocreate a novel electronic health record 
      ICU-ward transfer tool alongside Internal Medicine residents at three academic
      hospitals. Methods: We conducted HCD workshops at each hospital, performing
      process mapping, brainstorming, and rapid prototyping. We performed thematic
      analysis on verbatim-transcribed workshop audio recordings to inform development 
      and adaptation of the final resident prototype into the ICU-PAUSE tool. Results: 
      ICU-PAUSE focuses on reasons for ICU admission and problem-based ICU course (I); 
      Code status, goals of care, and family contacts (C); a diagnostic pause
      acknowledging Uncertainty (U); Pending tests (P); Active consultants (A);
      high-risk medications, including medications to be Unprescribed (U); Summary of
      problems and to-dos (S); and a current physical Exam (E). Conclusion: We used HCD
      to cocreate a novel, more user-friendly electronic ICU-ward transfer tool,
      ICU-PAUSE, alongside Internal Medicine trainees. Future steps will involve formal
      usability testing, evidence-driven implementation, and clinical evaluation of
      ICU-PAUSE across multiple hospitals.

PG  - 2341-2351
LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S368453 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Acute primary angle closure (APAC) is an ophthalmologic emergency.
      Nationwide data on the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of APAC are
      lacking despite the associated visual morbidity. Patients and Methods: A
      retrospective cross-sectional study using the Nationwide Emergency Department
      Sample (NEDS). The NEDS was queried by ICD-9/10 code for cases of APAC presenting
      to the United States emergency departments over a ten-year period from 2008 to
      2017. All identified cases were included to produce nationally representative
      estimates. Linear regression and seasonality tests were used to identify trends. 
      Reported outcomes include the incidence, demographics, seasonality, and economic 
      impact of APAC regionally and nationwide. Results: A total of 23,203 APAC-related
      ED visits were identified. The mean (SD) and median ages were 58.8 (16.2) and 60 
      years, respectively. Females (59.4%, p < 0.01), those in the lowest income
      quartile (6983, 30.1%, p < 0.01), and those in the seventh decade of life (5599, 
      24.1%) presented more frequently with APAC. The incidence of ED presentations
      within each age group rose with age and increased significantly over the study
      period (p < 0.01). The Northeast region had the highest average incidence (0.93
      per 100,000 population). Significant seasonal variation was seen regionally and
      nationally (p < 0.01), with the highest average incidence in December and lowest 
      in April. Median inflation adjusted charge per ED visit was $2496.10, and the
      total inflation adjusted charges equaled $101.5 million. Conclusion: The
      incidence of APAC-related ED visits continues to rise in the United States.
      High-risk groups include women, individuals of low socioeconomic status, and
      those between ages 50 and 70. Significant seasonal and regional trends were
      observed in ED presentations of APAC.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study comprised the anatomical and functional assessment 
      of the optic nerves and macular ganglion cells in the population of patients with
      unilateral wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and comparison of its
      results to those obtained from the fellow eye with non-advanced dry age-related
      macular degeneration (dAMD). Furthermore, we aimed to determine if the number of 
      administered injections contributed to the potential differences between the
      examined eyes. Methods: The study was based on 104 eyes of 52 patients in a
      cross-sectional study. The eyes with chronically treated wAMD were the main
      subject of the study, while fellow eyes affected with non-advanced dAMD served as
      the control group. Primary morphological outcomes comprised differences in
      peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and GCC layers between the studied
      groups (treated and control). In turn, primary functional outcomes included
      differences in implicit times and amplitudes of the P100 wave of pattern visual
      evoked potentials (PVEP) and N95 wave of pattern electroretinogram (PERG) between
      treated and control groups. Results: We did not find any differences in total
      RNFL thickness between wAMD and dAMD groups. The number of injections only
      affected the RNFL in the nasal quadrant of the optic disc (p = 0.023). We did not
      find any differences regarding GCL thickness in both groups. In the study group, 
      a longer implicit time of the P100 of PVEP (p = 0.014) and a shorter amplitude of
      the P50-N95 wave of PERG (p = 0.005) were detected. The total number of
      injections had no significant effect on these two values. Conclusion: We detected
      worse functional parameters of the optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells in eyes
      with wAMD, with lack of significant differences in anatomical (RNFL, GCL)
      parameters compared to the control group. However, the number of injections did
      not contribute to the differences found.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to examine which path among direct and indirect
      effects was more influential to the quality of life (QOL) for patients with human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Methods: An observational study among 951
      individuals diagnosed with HIV was conducted in designated acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) medical institutions in Hangzhou using simple
      random sampling technique. We collected the demographic data of patients and then
      evaluated their QOL by 12-Item Short-Form (SF-12) questionnaire survey. The
      two-stage least squares analysis was firstly performed to filter the independent 
      influencing factors of Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component
      Summary (MCS). We then enrolled the PCS, MCS, and their influencing factors into 
      the path analysis of QOL, and further revealed the direct and indirect effects of
      variables and examined the important path that was more influential on the
      patient's QOL. Results: The patient's PCS, MCS, and quality of life showed a
      significant difference between groups in terms of education level and working
      condition (all P<0.05). Regression analysis showed that depression, age,
      education level, and treatment independently affected the PCS (all P<0.05), and
      depression and anxiety exerted an independent effect on the MCS (all P<0.05).
      Further path analysis integrating related variables showed that the main indexes 
      of the goodness of fit implied the final model fit the data well. The path
      analysis showed that PCS and MCS exerted direct effects on the QOL (all P<0.001),
      especially the MCS (beta=0.785), but other variables exerted no direct effects
      (all beta=0, all P>0.05). It should be noted that anxiety presented an obvious
      indirect effect on the QOL (beta=0.460), and its indirect effect was similar to
      the direct effect of PCS (beta=0.471). Conclusion: The MCS might exert a more
      important effect on the QOL of HIV patients. In addition, the indirect effect of 
      anxiety on the QOL should not be ignored.

TI  - Assessment of Patient Knowledge Level Towards MRI Safety Before the Scanning in
      Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 6289-6299
LID - 10.2147/IJGM.S368652 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important diagnostic method in
      modern clinical medicine. Patients' knowledge about MRI is of utmost importance
      for optimizing the workflow, safety, and patient comfort and saving valuable time
      for the MRI department. This study investigates patient knowledge levels
      regarding MRI safety before an MRI examination. Patients and Methods: A
      cross-sectional survey was completed by 200 patients who required MRI.
      Recruitment occurred over eight weeks in governmental and private hospitals in
      Saudi Arabia; both hospitals and participants were selected randomly. The
      questionnaire was given to the patients prior to their MRI scans. Descriptive
      statistics and chi-square tests were performed to identify relationships between 
      knowledge of MRI safety and selected demographic groupings (age, gender,
      education level, income level). It also evaluates their source of information and
      assesses the patient's previous experience regarding MRI scans.. Results: The
      study sample consisted of 200 patients from 230 surveys distributed in Saudi
      Arabia, and the response rate was ~ 87%. Depending on the P-values of the
      chi-square statistical test to find the relationship between socio-demographic
      factors and patient' knowledge level, the results showed a significant
      association (p-value=0.006) between age and gender and the level of knowledge
      relating to MRI safety issues. A similar significance (p-value=0.042) is observed
      between the knowledge level of patients and their educational level and annual
      income. In addition, a highly significant association (p-value<0.001) is found
      between education level or previous experience and whether people seek
      information about MRI safety. Conclusion: The study findings suggest that a
      complex combination of factors affects patient knowledge regarding MRI safety
      before an MRI examination. Hence, the hospital and radiological department must
      provide the patient with accurate information about MRI..

LID - 10.2147/IJGM.S371697 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Thyroid disease is an independent predictor of heart failure in
      patients. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction
      among patients with heart failure in Mogadishu, Somalia. Methods: From January
      2019 to January 2021, a total of 250 patients diagnosed with heart failure
      admitted to the cardiology outpatient and emergency departments were evaluated
      retrospectively. The demographic characteristics, the cause of heart failure, and
      the kind of heart failure were recorded. Patients were categorized into
      subclinical hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism, low T3 syndrome, subclinical
      hyperthyroidism, and hyperthyroidism. Results: A total of 250 heart failure
      patients. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction among heart failure patients was 
      35.6%. The mean age of the patients was 59.8+/-14 years. Males outnumbered
      females by 159 (63.2%). The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction was 35.6%. Out of
      the 250 patients that were examined, most of the patients 30(33.3%) had
      subclinical hypothyroidism. 23 (25.6%) had overt hypothyroidism, 15 (16.7%) had
      overt hyperthyroidism, 20 (22.2%) had low T3 syndrome, and two cases had
      subclinical hyperthyroidism. Regarding the gender status of the thyroid
      dysfunction, 43(48.3%) were male, and 46(51.7%) were female. Regarding heart
      failure types among thyroid dysfunction patients, most patients were HFrEF (n=64,
      71.9%), and 25(28.1%) were HFpEF. Patients with heart failure and reduced
      ejection fraction (HFrEF) were more likely to have thyroid dysfunction than those
      with preserved ejection fraction (p = 0.012). Regarding comorbidities among heart
      failure patients with thyroid dysfunction, approximately half of the patients had
      hypertension (40.4%). Conclusion: Thyroid problems are one of the most prevalent 
      endocrine abnormalities in our practice. Subclinical hypothyroidism was the most 
      common type of thyroid dysfunction among this population. We suggest that thyroid
      function be evaluated with cardiac function in patients with heart failure and
      followed up and treated together with heart failure.

AB  - Background: The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was approved in 2006 and has
      been shown to decrease vaccine-related HPV types in the oropharynx. Its impact on
      the incidence of HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has
      not been examined. We investigated the impact of HPV vaccination on the incidence
      of HPV-related OPSCC in the US among male and female adults from different age
      groups. Methods: The US Cancer Statistics 2001-2018 database and the National
      Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program
      were used in this study. OPSCC incidence was age-adjusted to the US standard
      population in 2000. Cause-specific 5-year survival probability was calculated
      using 60 monthly intervals in SEER*Stat software. Results: Incidence of
      HPV-related OPSCC was much higher in males than in females. Age-adjusted annual
      incidence of OPSCC was significantly lower in 2014-2018 than in 2002-2006 among
      males 20-44 years old (11.4 vs 12.8 per 1,000,000, rate ratio 0.89, 95%
      confidence interval 0.84-0.93) and among females 20-44 years old (3.0 vs 3.6 per 
      1,000,000, rate ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.78-0.95), but increased in 
      both 45-64 year old and 65+ year old males and females. Joinpoint regression
      revealed a significant joint in the HPV-OPSCC incidence trend for 20-44-year-old 
      males in 2008 at which time the incidence began to decrease. Except for 20-44
      year old females (74.8% in 2002-2006 vs. 75.7% in 2009-2013, p=0.84),
      cancer-specific 5-year survivals significantly improved for males and females of 
      all age groups. Conclusions: HPV-related OPSCC was much more common in males.
      Incidence of HPV-related OPSCC declined among young adults during the vaccination
      era compared with pre-vaccination era. Cancer-specific 5-year survival was
      significantly improved in young males but not in young females.

AB  - Objective: The selection of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) or open laparotomy
      for ovarian cancer (OC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy still remains
      controversial. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of MIS versus
      open laparotomy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced OC, so as to
      provide another option to select optimal surgical procedures for patients with
      OC. Methods: Relevant literature studies about the risks of progression or
      mortality between women receiving MIS and open laparotomy for interval debulking 
      surgery (IDS) were searched in the online databases, including PubMed, Embase,
      and the Cochrane Library with the following keywords: "ovarian neoplasms",
      "minimally invasive surgical procedures", "laparotomy", and "neoadjuvant
      therapy". Eligible studies were screened out for further meta-analysis. Results: 
      Six eligible literature studies, with 643 patients in the MIS group and 2,885
      patients in the open laparotomy group, were included in this meta-analysis. No
      significant differences were detected in the overall survival (OS) of patients
      with OC who were treated with MIS or open laparotomy [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85;
      95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.59-1.23; heterogeneity: P = 0.051, I(2) =
      57.6%]. However, the progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly higher in 
      patients with OC treated with MIS than those treated with laparotomy (HR = 0.73; 
      95% CI = 0.57 to 0.92; heterogeneity: P = 0.276, I(2) = 22.4%). The completeness 
      of debulking removal (R0 rate) in the open laparotomy group was not statistically
      higher compared with the control group (RR = 1.07; 95% CI = 0.93 to 1.23;
      heterogeneity: P = 0.098, I(2) = 52.3%), and no significant differences in
      residual disease of </=1 cm (R1) (RR = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.28;
      heterogeneity: P = 0.330, I(2) = 12.6%) and postoperative complications were
      found between the two groups (RR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.34 to 1.54; heterogeneity: P 
      = 0.055, I(2) = 60.6%). Furthermore, the length of stays in hospital was
      significantly shorter in patients with OC treated with MIS than those treated
      with open laparotomy (Standard Mean Difference (SMD) = -1.21; 95% CI = -1.78 to
      -0.64; heterogeneity: P < 0.001, I(2) = 92.7%]. Conclusions: For IDS after NACT
      in patients with advanced OC, complete cytoreductive surgery with MIS is another 
      feasible and effective choice. Systematic Review Registration:

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to propose and evaluate a novel
      three-dimensional (3D) V-Net and two-dimensional (2D) U-Net mixed (VUMix-Net)
      architecture for a fully automatic and accurate gross tumor volume (GTV) in
      esophageal cancer (EC)-delineated contours. Methods: We collected the computed
      tomography (CT) scans of 215 EC patients. 3D V-Net, 2D U-Net, and VUMix-Net were 
      developed and further applied simultaneously to delineate GTVs. The Dice
      similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (95HD) were
      used as quantitative metrics to evaluate the performance of the three models in
      ECs from different segments. The CT data of 20 patients were randomly selected as
      the ground truth (GT) masks, and the corresponding delineation results were
      generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Score differences between the two
      groups (GT versus AI) and the evaluation consistency were compared. Results: In
      all patients, there was a significant difference in the 2D DSCs from U-Net,
      V-Net, and VUMix-Net (p=0.01). In addition, VUMix-Net showed achieved better
      3D-DSC and 95HD values. There was a significant difference among the 3D-DSC (mean
      +/- STD) and 95HD values for upper-, middle-, and lower-segment EC (p<0.001), and
      the middle EC values were the best. In middle-segment EC, VUMix-Net achieved the 
      highest 2D-DSC values (p<0.001) and lowest 95HD values (p=0.044). Conclusion: The
      new model (VUMix-Net) showed certain advantages in delineating the GTVs of EC.
      Additionally, it can generate the GTVs of EC that meet clinical requirements and 
      have the same quality as human-generated contours. The system demonstrated the
      best performance for the ECs of the middle segment.

AB  - Objective: The relationship between serum lipids and prognosis of gastric cancer 
      has not been confirmed. Our purpose in the study was to investigate the
      associations between preoperative and postoperative serum lipids level and
      prognosis in patients with gastric cancer. Methods: A retrospective study was
      performed on 431 patients who received radical (R0) gastrectomy from 2011 to
      2013. Preoperative and postoperative serum lipids level were recorded.
      Clinical-pathological characteristics, oncologic outcomes, disease-free survival 
      (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were collected. The prognostic significance was
      determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression
      model. Results: There was no significant difference in DFS and OS according to
      preoperative serum lipids level. Regarding postoperative serum lipids level,
      compared to normal high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low
      postoperative HDL-C level indicated a shorter OS (hazard ratio: 1.76, 99%
      confidence interval: 1.31-2.38; P=0.000) and a shorter DFS (hazard ratio: 2.06,
      99% confidence interval: 1.55-2.73; P=0.000). However, other postoperative serum 
      lipid molecules were not associated with DFS and OS. Conclusion: Postoperative
      HDL-C might be an independent prognostic factor of gastric cancer.

TI  - Survival Risk Scores for Real-Life Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients 
      Receiving Elotuzumab or Carfilzomib In Combination With Lenalidomide and
      Dexamethasone as Salvage Therapy: Analysis of 919 Cases Outside Clinical Trials.
PG  - 890376
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.890376 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to develop two survival risk scores (RS) for overall
      survival (OS, SRS (KRd/EloRd) ) and progression-free survival (PFS, PRS
      (KRd/EloRd) ) in 919 relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients who
      received carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd)/elotuzumab,
      lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (EloRd). The median OS was 35.4 months, with no
      significant difference between the KRd arm versus the EloRd arm. In the
      multivariate analysis, advanced ISS (HR = 1.31; P = 0.025), interval
      diagnosis-therapy (HR = 1.46; P = 0.001), number of previous lines of therapies
      (HR = 1.96; P < 0.0001), older age (HR = 1.72; P < 0.0001), and prior
      lenalidomide exposure (HR = 1.30; P = 0.026) remained independently associated
      with death. The median PFS was 20.3 months, with no difference between the two
      strategies. The multivariate model identified a significant progression/death
      risk increase for ISS III (HR = 1.37; P = 0.002), >3 previous lines of therapies 
      (HR = 1.67; P < 0.0001), older age (HR = 1.64; P < 0.0001), and prior
      lenalidomide exposure (HR = 1.35; P = 0.003). Three risk SRS (KRd/EloRd)
      categories were generated: low-risk (134 cases, 16.5%), intermediate-risk (467
      cases, 57.3%), and high-risk categories (213 cases, 26.2%). The 1- and 2-year OS 
      probability rates were 92.3% and 83.8% for the low-risk (HR = 1, reference
      category), 81.1% and 60.6% (HR = 2.73; P < 0.0001) for the intermediate-risk, and
      65.5% and 42.5% (HR = 4.91; P < 0.0001) for the high-risk groups, respectively.
      Notably, unlike the low-risk group, which did not cross the median timeline, the 
      OS median values were 36.6 and 18.6 months for the intermediate- and high-risk
      cases, respectively. Similarly, three PRS (KRd/EloRd) risk categories were
      engendered. Based on such grouping, 338 (41.5%) cases were allocated in the low-,
      248 (30.5%) in the intermediate-, and 228 (28.0%) in the high-risk groups. The 1-
      and 2-year PFS probability rates were 71.4% and 54.5% for the low-risk (HR = 1,
      reference category), 68.9% and 43.7% (HR = 1.95; P < 0.0001) for the
      intermediate-risk, and 48.0% and 27.1% (HR = 3.73; P < 0.0001) for the high-risk 
      groups, respectively. The PFS median values were 29.0, 21.0, and 11.7 months for 
      the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk cases. This analysis showed 2.7- and
      4.9-fold increased risk of death for the intermediate- and high-risk cases
      treated with KRd/EloRd as salvage therapy. The combined progression/death risks
      of the two categories were increased 1.3- and 2.2-fold compared to the low-risk
      group. In conclusion, SRS (KRd/EloRd) and PRS (KRd/EloRd) may represent
      accessible and globally applicable models in daily clinical practice and
      ultimately represent a prognostic tool for RRMM patients who received KRd or
      EloRd.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to develop a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)
      model to classify molecular subtypes of breast cancer from ultrasound (US) images
      together with clinical information. Methods: A total of 1,012 breast cancer
      patients with 2,284 US images (center 1) were collected as the main cohort for
      training and internal testing. Another cohort of 117 breast cancer cases with 153
      US images (center 2) was used as the external testing cohort. Patients were
      grouped according to thresholds of nodule sizes of 20 mm and age of 50 years. The
      DCNN models were constructed based on US images and the clinical information to
      predict the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. A Breast Imaging-Reporting and
      Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon model was built on the same data based on
      morphological and clinical description parameters for diagnostic performance
      comparison. The diagnostic performance was assessed through the accuracy,
      sensitivity, specificity, Youden's index (YI), and area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Our DCNN model achieved better
      diagnostic performance than the BI-RADS lexicon model in differentiating
      molecular subtypes of breast cancer in both the main cohort and external testing 
      cohort (all p < 0.001). In the main cohort, when classifying luminal A from
      non-luminal A subtypes, our model obtained an AUC of 0.776 (95% CI, 0.649-0.885) 
      for patients older than 50 years and 0.818 (95% CI, 0.726-0.902) for those with
      tumor sizes </=20 mm. For young patients </=50 years, the AUC value of our model 
      for detecting triple-negative breast cancer was 0.712 (95% CI, 0.538-0.874). In
      the external testing cohort, when classifying luminal A from non-luminal A
      subtypes for patients older than 50 years, our DCNN model achieved an AUC of
      0.686 (95% CI, 0.567-0.806). Conclusions: We employed a DCNN model to predict the
      molecular subtypes of breast cancer based on US images. Our model can be valuable
      depending on the patient's age and nodule sizes.

AB  - Objectives: To explore the possible risk factors of orocutaneous fistula (OCF)
      development in free flap reconstruction of the tongue/floor of the mouth (TFOM). 
      Methods: Data of patients who underwent free flap reconstruction of the TFOM were
      retrospectively analyzed. The association between clinicopathologic variables and
      OCF occurrence was analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: 
      Altogether, 469 patients were enrolled. OCF occurred in 43 patients with a rate
      of 9.2%. The univariate analysis revealed the negative effects of smoking,
      preoperative albumin level, cachexia, T4 stage, neck dissection, entire resection
      of the floor of the mouth (FOM), segmental mandibulectomy, and surgical site
      infection on OCF occurrence. The multivariate analysis confirmed the independence
      of cachexia (p<0.001, 4.386[1.883-9.472]), tumor stage (p<0.001,
      2.738[1.482-6.629]), entire FOM resection (p<0.001, 6.332[2.110-14.432]), and
      surgical site infection (p<0.001, 5.376[1.998-11.218]) in affecting the OCF
      development. Conclusions: OCF development following free flap reconstruction of
      the TFOM was relatively uncommon, but significantly associated with presence of
      cachexia, T4 stage, entire FOM resection, and surgical site infection.

      Efficacy for Advanced Distant Metastatic Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.
PG  - 871792
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.871792 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Host immunity influences the impact of cancer therapy but the effect of 
      immune status in radioiodine (RAI)-treated differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)
      remains obscure. Here we investigated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity 
      as a biomarker of response to RAI in patients with distant metastatic DTC
      (dmDTC). Methods: Patients with dmDTC receiving RAI were evaluated for serum IDO 
      activity (kynurenine and kynurenine:tryptophan ratio) at baseline and 3 months
      after RAI. The optimal cut-off value for these biomarkers to predict response was
      established by receiver operating characteristic analysis. The relationship
      between disease outcomes, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival
      (PFS), and IDO activity levels was studied. Results: Higher baseline
      kynurenine:tryptophan ratio (>2.46) was correlated with poorer RAI response as
      well as shorter median PFS (45 mo versus not reached, p=0.002) and OS (78 mo
      versus not reached, p=0.035). High baseline kynurenine:tryptophan ratio was also 
      correlated with a reduced number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Higher
      post/pre-kynurenine ratio (>1.69) was associated with survival endpoints: shorter
      median PFS (48 mo versus not reached, p=0.002) and OS (68 mo versus not reached, 
      p=0.010). Favorable baseline and favorable change corresponded with better PFS
      and OS. Conclusions: Our results suggest that RAI also alters IDO activity in
      dmDTC patients. IDO activity could predict progression and survival outcomes for 
      advanced dmDTC patients. Serum IDO biomarker levels could be used to select dmDTC
      likely to benefit from RAI therapy, although further studies are necessary.

TI  - The Predictive Value of Pretreatment Lactate Dehydrogenase and Derived
      Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
      Treated With PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 791496
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.791496 [doi]
AB  - Background: The Lung Immune Prognostic Index (LIPI) combines the lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH) level and the derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR). 
      A lot of studies have shown that LDH and dNLR are associated with the prognosis
      of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients treated with
      programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      inhibitors. However, previous results were inconsistent, and the conclusions
      remain unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the predictive value of
      pretreatment LDH and dNLR for NSCLC progression in patients treated with
      PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were
      searched by two researchers independently for related literature before March
      2020. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were extracted to
      assess the predictive value of LDH and dNLR. STATA 15. 0 was used to perform the 
      meta-analysis. Results: A total of 3,429 patients from 26 studies were included
      in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that high pretreatment LDH was
      related to poor OS (HR = 1.19, 95%CI = 1.11-1.24, p < 0.001), but not closely
      related to poor PFS (HR = 1.02, 95%CI = 1.00-1.04, p = 0.023 < 0.05). The pooled 
      results for dNLR suggested that high pretreatment dNLR was related to poor OS (HR
      = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.33-1.80, p < 0.001) and PFS (HR = 1.33, 95%CI = 1.16-1.54, p < 
      0.001). Conclusion: Both pretreatment LDH and dNLR have the potential to serve as
      peripheral blood biomarkers for patients with advanced NSCLC treated with
      PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. However, more studies on LDH are needed to evaluate its
      predictive value for PFS in patients with NSCLC.

AB  - Objective: In Africa, there is up to 316 per 100,000 annual incidence rate of
      stroke, a prevalence of up to 1460 per 100,000, and a 3-year mortality rate
      higher than 80%. The incidence of stroke mortality in Ethiopia is 19.2%. Stroke
      is a major cause of disability and death worldwide. Early mortality in-hospital
      and deprived functional outcomes are common in acute stroke. This study aims to
      assess survival status and predictors of mortality among adult stroke patients.
      Methods: Institution-based retrospective cohort was conducted on patients who
      were admitted to Saint Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College. A simple
      random sampling technique was used. Bivariate and multivariable cox regression
      analysis were used to identify predictors of stroke mortality. For multivariable 
      cox regression analysis statistically, significance was declared at p-value <0.05
      and 95% CI. Results: A total of 251 adult stroke patient charts were included in 
      the study. The overall Kaplan-Meier estimate showed that the probability of
      in-hospital stroke patients' survival on the 41st day was nearly 50%. In this
      study, 77 (30.7%) of the study participants died. Decreased Glasgow Coma Scale
      (GCS) with adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 4.26 (95% CI: 2.25-8.07) and p-value 0.01 
      and presence of pneumonia with AHR 3.05 (95% CI: 1.29-7.21) and p-value 0.01 are 
      the predictor of mortality. Conclusion: The probability of survival relatively
      falls as follow-up time increases. The overall incidence of mortality among adult
      stroke patients was high. The decreased GCS and the presence of pneumonia are
      predictors of mortality among adult stroke patients.

TI  - How Are Imaging Findings Associated with Exocrine Insufficiency in Idiopathic
      Chronic Pancreatitis?
PG  - 182-190
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1744138 [doi]
AB  - Aim The aim is to study the association between imaging findings in chronic
      pancreatitis and fecal elastase 1 (FE1) in patients with idiopathic chronic
      pancreatitis (ICP). Methods In this retrospective study on a prospectively
      maintained database of patients with ICP, a radiologist blinded to clinical and
      laboratory findings reviewed CT and/or MRI. Findings were documented according to
      recommendations of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis,
      Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer, October 2018. Low FE1 (<100 mug elastase/g) was 
      considered diagnostic of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). Association
      between imaging findings and FE1 was studied. Results In total, 70 patients (M: F
      = 37:33) with ICP with mean age of 24.2 (SD 6.5) years, range 10 to 37 years and 
      mean disease duration of 5.6 (SD 4.6) years, range 0 to 20 years were included.
      Mean FE level was 82.5 (SD 120.1), range 5 to 501 mug elastase/g. Mean main
      pancreatic duct (MPD) caliber was 7 (SD 4) mm, range 3 to 21 mm and mean
      pancreatic parenchymal thickness (PPT) was 13.7 (SD 5.5) mm, range 5 to 27 mm.
      There was a significant association between FE1 and MPD size, PPT, type of
      pancreatic calcification; presence of intraductal stones, side branch dilatation 
      on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and extent of pancreatic
      involvement ( p <0.05). In total, 79%, 86%, and 78% with moderate to severe MPD
      dilatation, pancreatic atrophy, and side branch dilatation had low FE1,
      respectively. But nearly half of those with no or mild structural abnormality on 
      imaging had low FE1. Conclusion Significant association between FE1 and specific 
      imaging findings demonstrates its potential as a marker of exocrine insufficiency
      and disease severity in chronic pancreatitis. But imaging and FE1 are
      complementary rather than supplementary.

TI  - Role of Shear-Wave Elastography in Achilles Tendon in Psoriatic Arthritis and Its
      Correlation with Disease Severity Score, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index.
PG  - 159-165
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1743116 [doi]
AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to compare accuracy of shear-wave elastography 
      (SWE) with gray scale (GS) ultrasound and power Doppler (pD) for diagnosing
      Achilles tendinopathy in psoriatic patients with and without arthritis and
      correlation with achillodynia and disease severity score, psoriasis area and
      severity index (PASI). Methods A total of 100 Achilles tendons were evaluated
      where 56% were cases of psoriatic arthritis with achillodynia; 44% were controls 
      of psoriasis without arthritis in this prospective study. Evaluation was done
      with GS, pD, SWE at proximal, mid, and distal third of the tendon. Qualitative
      (color maps) and quantitative data, elastic modulus, kilopascal (kPa), were
      generated. Pearson's correlation was done to see association between kPa, PASI
      and clinical symptoms, achillodynia, scored using visual analog scale (VAS).
      Results Significant negative correlation was seen between duration of arthritis, 
      VAS and PASI with SWE values with r = -0.34, -0.47, and -0.41, respectively. SWE 
      could identify abnormal tendons in 71/100 (71%) in the overall study, 53/56
      (94.6%) in cases, and 18/44 (40.9%) in control. The statistical significance was 
      set at p </= 0.05. In comparison, conventional ultrasound, GS, and pD together
      could identify 13/56 (23.21%) in cases and no abnormal tendon was identified in
      the control group. Conclusion SWE is a reliable, noninvasive, and valuable tool
      to detect early tendinopathy and monitor progression of disease.

TI  - Management of MRI-Detected Benign Internal Mammary Lymph Nodes.
PG  - 197-204
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1750180 [doi]
AB  - Introduction In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate benign internal
      mammary lymph nodes (IMLNs) in terms of frequency, number, size, long axis/short 
      axis (L/S) ratio, intercostal location, presence of fatty hilum, and stability
      using breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discuss the findings by
      reviewing existing literature. Methods This single-center study consisted of 130 
      women between the ages of 24 and 76 years, who had at least two breast MRI
      examinations in our institution, with the latest exam performed between January
      1, 2019 and November 1, 2019, were eligible for the study. MRIs of the study
      group were independently reviewed by two radiologists. Results IMLN was detected 
      in 31.1% of the 427 MRIs, with a total number of 256 nodes. The most common
      indication for breast MRI was high-risk screening (66.2%). The median number of
      nodes per patient was 1 (range: 1-6). The median follow-up time was 19.5 months
      (range: 6-141 months). None of these benign nodes showed significant interval
      growth. Mean L/R ratio of the nodes was 1.9. One hundred and four nodes ( n =
      104, 40.6%) had a L/S ratio less than 2 and 43.2% ( n = 45) of the nodes with a
      L/S ratio less than 2, had a long axis measuring less than or equal to 3mm. IMLN 
      of patients with breast implants had the largest mean long axis. The fatty hilum 
      was identified in 34.3% ( n = 68) of the 256 nodes. The size of the lymph nodes
      where fatty hilum was visualized was significantly larger than the ones where
      fatty hilum was not visualized ( p < 0.001). Fatty hilum could be visualized in
      only 2.7% of the nodes with a long axis smaller than 3 mm. Conclusion IMLN is a
      frequent finding on breast MRI. We have shown that benign IMLNs might be large
      sized in specific cases like patients with breast implants. When small sized
      (</=3mm), they are more likely to be rounded (L/S ratio <2). The fatty hilum that
      is a feature of benignity might not be visualized in nodes less than or equal
      to3mm.

      Factors of Patients.
PG  - 8279357
LID - 10.1155/2022/8279357 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To survey the clinical manifestations and imaging features of
      temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and analyze the risk factors for
      pathogenesis/prognosis through a case-control study based on psychogenic factors 
      of patients. Methods: According to the inclusion criteria, 200 adult patients
      were randomly enrolled from the maxillofacial department of our hospital from
      January 2020 to May 2021, including 100 patients with TMD as the study group and 
      100 healthy patients as the control group. The study group can be assigned into
      four subgroups according to their clinical manifestations: (1) articular area
      or/and masticatory muscle pain group, (2) mandibular movement abnormality group, 
      (3) joint murmur group, and (4) two or more symptom groups. Based on the study of
      psychogenic factors of patients, the clinical manifestations and imaging features
      of TMD were determined, and the risk factors for pathogenesis/prognosis were
      analyzed. Results: The distribution of psychological status in the TMD group was 
      higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The distribution of anxiety,
      depression, and somatic symptoms in the TMD group was significantly different
      from that in the control group (P < 0.05). Anxiety, depression, and somatic
      symptoms were the risk factors for TMD. Compared with the control group, the
      incidence of abnormal MRI images in patients with temporomandibular disorders was
      significantly different (P < 0.05). There were significant differences in
      psychological status (anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms) among the three 
      groups (P < 0.05). Anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms were the risk
      factors for abnormal mandibular movement and joint tremor and murmur (P < 0.05). 
      Somatic symptoms were the risk factors for various clinical symptoms of TMD (P < 
      0.05). Depression was the risk factor for pain (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In
      patients with TMD, MRI can early identify disc abnormalities and other related
      imaging features, which is helpful for more comprehensive clinical evaluation and
      treatment of TMD patients. There exhibits no significant difference in
      psychological status (anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms) of patients with
      different clinical symptoms, and abnormal psychological status may be one of the 
      risk factors leading to different clinical symptoms and development of different 
      types of TMD patients.

TI  - Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Chondroitin Combined with Glucosamine in the
      Treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 5285244

AB  - Objective: This analysis was aimed at providing evidence-based medicine basis for
      systematic evaluation of chondroitin combined with glucosamine in the treatment
      of knee osteoarthritis. Methods: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of
      chondroitin combined with glucosamine in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis
      (KOA) were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, China
      Knowledge Network Database (CNKI), China VIP Database, Wanfang Database, and
      China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) online database. The retrieval time
      ranges from the database creation to the present. Two investigators gathered the 
      information individually. The risk of bias was assessed using the criteria of the
      Cochrane back review group. RevMan5.4 statistical software analyzed the selected 
      data. Results: A total of 6 RCT articles were obtained. Overall, 764 samples were
      evaluated by meta-analysis. The clinical efficacy of chondroitin combined with
      glucosamine was significantly better than that of routine treatment by
      meta-analysis. The confidence interval of 95% was (4.86, 17.08) (Z = 6.89, P <
      0.00001). The scores of joint pain, tenderness, swelling, and dysfunction in
      patients with knee osteoarthritis treated with chondroitin combined with
      glucosamine were significantly lower than those treated with routine treatment.
      There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between
      chondroitin combined with glucosamine and single treatment of KOA. Due to the
      small number of documents included in the analysis, it is not suitable to make a 
      funnel chart, but there may be some publication deviation in the analysis.
      Conclusion: Chondroitin combined with glucosamine is more effective than
      chondroitin or glucosamine alone in the treatment of KOA and deserves clinical
      promotion. However, this conclusion still needs to be supported by multicenter,
      high-quality, double-blind, large-sample randomized controlled clinical trials
      due to the limitations of the six trials included.

PG  - 3336644
LID - 10.1155/2022/3336644 [doi]
AB  - Good health is the most important and very necessary characteristic for
      stress-free, skillful, and hardworking people with a cooperative environment to
      create a sustainable society. Validating two algorithms, namely, sequential
      minimal optimization for regression (SMOreg) using vector machine and linear
      regression (LR) and using their predicted cancer patients' cases, this study
      presents a patient's stress estimation model (PSEM) to forecast their families'
      stress for patients' sustainable health and better care with early management by 
      under-study cancer hospitals. The year-wise predictions (1998-2010) by LR and
      SMOreg are verified by comparing with observed values. The statistical difference
      between the predictions (2021-2030) by these models is analyzed using a
      statistical t-test. From the data of 217067 patients, patients' stress-impacting 
      factors are extracted to be used in the proposed PSEM. By considering the total
      population of under-study areas and getting the predicted population (2021-2030) 
      of each area, the proposed PSEM forecasts overall stress for expected cancer
      patients (2021-2030). Root mean square error (RMSE) (1076.15.46) for LR is less
      than RSME for SMOreg (1223.75); hence, LR remains better than SMOreg in
      forecasting (2011-2020). There is no significant statistical difference between
      values (2021-2030) predicted by LR and SMOreg (p value = 0.767 > 0.05). The
      average stress for a family member of a cancer patient is 72.71%. It is concluded
      that under-study areas face a minimum of 2.18% stress, on average 30.98% stress, 
      and a maximum of 94.81% overall stress because of 179561 expected cancer patients
      of all major types from 2021 to 2030.

PG  - 8752826
LID - 10.1155/2022/8752826 [doi]
AB  - Objective: A predictive model was established based on logistic regression and
      XGBoost algorithm to investigate the factors related to postoperative
      hypocalcemia in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Methods: A
      total of 60 SHPT patients who underwent parathyroidectomy (PTX) in our hospital
      were retrospectively enrolled. All patients were randomly divided into a training
      set (n = 42) and a test set (n = 18). The clinical data of the patients were
      analyzed, including gender, age, dialysis time, body mass, and several
      preoperative biochemical indicators. The multivariate logistic regression and
      XGBoost algorithm models were used to analyze the independent risk factors for
      severe postoperative hypocalcemia (SH). The forecasting efficiency of the two
      prediction models is analyzed. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis
      showed that body mass (OR = 1.203, P = 0.032), age (OR = 1.214, P = 0.035),
      preoperative PTH (OR = 1.026, P = 0.043), preoperative Ca (OR = 1.062, P =
      0.025), and preoperative ALP (OR = 1.031, P = 0.027) were positively correlated
      with postoperative SH. The top three important features of XGBoost algorithm
      prediction model were preoperative Ca, preoperative PTH, and preoperative ALP.
      The area under the curve of the logistic regression and XGBoost algorithm model
      in the test set was 0.734 (95% CI: 0.595~0.872) and 0.827 (95% CI: 0.722~0.932), 
      respectively. Conclusion: The predictive models based on the logistic regression 
      and XGBoost algorithm model can predict the occurrence of postoperative SH.

AB  - Objective: The convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to improve the
      accuracy of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in diagnosing moyamoya disease 
      (MMD), providing a new method for clinical diagnosis of MMD. Methods: A total of 
      40 diagnosed with MMD by DSA in the neurosurgery department of our hospital were 
      included. At the same time, 40 age-matched and sex-matched patients were selected
      as the control group. The 80 included patients were divided into training set (n 
      = 56) and validation set (n = 24). The DSA image was preprocessed, and the CNN
      was used to extract features from the preprocessed image. The precision and
      accuracy of the preprocessed image results were evaluated. Results: There was no 
      significant difference in baseline data between the training set and validation
      set (P > 0.05). The precision and accuracy of the images before processing were
      79.68% and 81.45%, respectively. After image processing, the precision and
      accuracy of the model are 96.38% and 97.59%, respectively. The area under the
      curve of the CNN algorithm model was 0.813 (95% CI: 0.718-0.826). Conclusion:
      This diagnostic method based on CNN performs well in MMD detection.

AB  - Aims: Colon cancer (CRC), with high morbidity and mortality, is a common and
      highly malignant cancer, which always has a bad prognosis. So it is urgent to
      employ a reasonable manner to assess the prognosis of patients. We developed and 
      validated a gene model for predicting CRC risk. Methods: The Gene Expression
      Omnibus (GEO) database was used to extract the gene expression profiles of CRC
      patients (N = 181) from GEO to identify genes that were differentially expressed 
      between CRC patients and controls and then stable signature genes by firstly
      using both robust likelihood-based modeling with 1000 iterations and random
      survival forest variable hunting algorithms. Cluster analysis using the longest
      distance method was drawn out, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis was used
      to compare the clusters. Meanwhile, the risk score was evaluated in three
      independent datasets including the GEO and Illumina HiSeq sequencing platforms.
      The corresponding risk index was calculated, and samples were clustered into
      high- and low-risk groups according to the median. And survival ROC analysis was 
      used to evaluate the prognostic model. Finally, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 
      (GSEA) was performed for further functional enrichment analyses. Results: A
      10-gene model was obtained, including 7 negative impact factors (SLC39A14, AACS, 
      ERP29, LAMP3, TMEM106C, TMED2, and SLC25A3) and 3 positive ones (CNPY2, GRB10,
      and PBK), which related with several important oncogenic pathways (KRAS
      signaling, TNF-alpha signaling pathway, and WNT signaling pathway) and several
      cancer-related cellular processes (epithelial mesenchymal transition and cellular
      apoptosis). By using colon cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),
      the model was validated in KM survival analysis (P </= 0.001) and significant
      analysis with recurrence time (P = 0.0018). Conclusions: This study firstly
      developed a stable and effective 10-gene model by using novel combined methods,
      and CRC patients might be able to use it as a prognostic marker for predicting
      their survival and monitoring their long-term treatment.

TI  - A Nomogram Based on SEER Database for Predicting Prognosis in Patients with
      Mucinous Ovarian Cancer: A Real-World Study.
PG  - 931-943

AB  - Purpose: Mucinous ovarian cancer (MOC) is a rare histological type of EOC. In
      order to guide the clinical diagnosis and management of MOC patients, we
      constructed and verified a nomogram for the estimation of overall survival in
      patients with MOC. Patients and Methods: We collected 494 patients with MOC
      diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 in SEER database, and the following main inclusion
      criteria were used: (1) patients whose MOC was confirmed by pathology; (2)
      patients without a history of primary other cancer. Subsequently, we performed
      randomized grouping (6:4) and Cox hazard regression analysis in the training
      group. Subsequently, the nomogram was established. A variety of indicators were
      used to validate the prognosis value of nomogram, including the C-index, area
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and
      decision curve analysis (DCA). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to
      compare the survival results among different risk subgroups. Results: Cox hazard 
      regression analysis revealed that age, grade, FIGO stage and log odds of positive
      lymph nodes stage were independent risk factors for patients with MOC. In the
      training group, the C-index of the nomogram was 0.827 (95% CI: 0.791-0.863) and
      the areas under the curve (AUC) predicting the 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rate
      were 0.853 (95% CI: 0.791-0.915), 0.886 (95% CI: 0.852-0.920) and 0.815 (95% CI: 
      0.766-0.864), respectively. The calibration curve revealed that the nomogram of
      the 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rate was consistent with the actual fact. Patients
      with high risk had a poorer prognosis than those with low risk (P < 0.001). DCA
      revealed that the nomogram had the best clinical value than other classical
      prognostic markers. Similarly, nomogram had excellent prognostic ability in the
      testing group. Conclusion: The nomogram was constructed to predict overall
      survival in patients with MOC, which had the significance for clinical
      evaluation.

LID - 10.2147/IJWH.S365236 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to clinically evaluate the application of
      liquid-based cytology P16, cytologic evaluation, and high-risk human
      papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing in cervical cancer screening. Methods: This study
      screened 900 women, who attended the outpatient clinic, according to the
      exclusion criteria of study participants. The study participants' screening
      results of liquid-based cytology P16, cytologic evaluation, and HR-HPV testing
      were analyzed. According to the pathological results of the biopsy, the efficacy 
      of different screening strategies for the identification of high-grade lesions
      was evaluated. Results: The positive rate of p16 expression increased with the
      severity of cervical lesions. P16 had the highest sensitivity and negative
      predictive value in identifying high-grade lesions (98.45% and 99.67%,
      respectively). Liquid-based Papanicolaou test (LBP), on the other hand, had the
      lowest sensitivity (85.27%) but the highest specificity (85.88%). HR-HPV's
      positive predictive value and accuracy rate were the lowest (32.77% and 70.03%,
      respectively). The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Dual
      combinations of certain tests were set up for this study; P16+LBP, HPV+LBP, and
      P16+HPV had sensitivities of 98.45%, 96.90%, and 99.22%, and specificities of
      80.29%, 63.42%, and 64.33%, respectively. The P16 screening rates of histological
      and liquid-based cytology approaches were 75.74%. Conclusion: Compared with
      traditional LBP+HPV, the application of a test that solely screen for P16 or the 
      combined screening method that involves the screening of P16 is more effective in
      identifying high-grade lesions.

TI  - Comparison of pain and psychosocial correlates among Hispanic and Non-Hispanic
      White youth with chronic pain.
PG  - e1020

AB  - Introduction: Despite well-documented pain disparities among adults from
      non-White and Hispanic groups, less is known about pain disparities in non-White 
      and Hispanic pediatric populations. Objectives: We compare pain and related
      psychosocial factors at the individual (pain intensity, pain interference, pain
      catastrophizing, co-occurring symptoms), social (peer relations), and systemic
      (health insurance) levels among Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) youth with 
      chronic pain. Methods: Eight hundred thirty-seven (71.4% female) Hispanic (n =
      268, 32%) and NHW (n = 569, 68%) youth ages 8 to 17 years (M = 14.00; SD = 2.54) 
      completed a survey at their initial visit to a pain clinic. Independent sample t 
      tests investigated mean differences in psychosocial factors at the individual and
      social levels. Chi-squared tests investigated differences at the systemic level. 
      Bivariate correlations for each group were compared using Fisher r-to-z
      transformations. Results: Hispanic youth reported higher levels of pain intensity
      (t[811] = -2.75, P = 0.006). Groups did not differ in reports of other individual
      or social factors. Non-Hispanic White youth were more likely to have private
      insurance (OR, 5.66). All examined variables were significantly correlated among 
      NHW youth. Correlations were weaker or nonsignificant among Hispanic youth.
      Fisher r-to-z transformations revealed these group differences to be significant.
      Conclusion: Hispanic youth report higher pain levels than NHW counterparts and
      lower likelihood of having private insurance. Pain and psychosocial factors
      correlate differently among the 2 groups highlighting a need to better understand
      the chronic pain experiences of diverse youth because models derived primarily
      from NHW populations may not generalize across ethnic and racial groups.

TI  - Ladder-Like Low Iodine Delivery Rate Injection Protocols Based on BMI at 70 KV by
      Automated Tube Voltage Selection in Coronary CTA.
PG  - 7804015
LID - 10.1155/2022/7804015 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of reducing the injection velocity and
      volume of contrast agent according to BMI, and the effect of body weight (BW),
      body surface areaBSA, body mass indexBMIand blood volume (BV) on aortic contrast 
      enhancement when the voltage of third-generation dual-source CT is selected at 70
      KV. Methods: A total of 280 patients selected at 70 KV were randomly divided into
      an experimental group and a control group. Each group was divided into 7
      subgroups according to BMI </=20, 20-21, 21-22, 22-23, 23-24, 24-25, and 25-26.
      The experimental group uses 2.3/2.4/2.5/2.6/2.7/2.8/2.9 ml/s injection speed with
      350 mgI/ml contrast agents according to the subgroups; injection time was fixed
      at 10 s. In the control group, the fixed injection flow rate was 3.5 ml/s, time
      was 12 s with a total of 42 ml. Subjects in both groups were inspected to
      adaptive prospective ECG-gating sequence scanning, and subjective and objective
      image quality of the two groups were compared using Student's t-test. BMI, BSA,
      and BV were calculated from the patient's body weight and height. We assess the
      relationship between aortic attenuation and BW, BMI, BV, and BSA using regression
      analysis or correlation analysis. Results: Significant differences exist in
      vascular enhancement between the two groups; SNR and CNR of objective image
      quality in the experimental group were lower than those in the control group (P <
      0.05). Both groups had the same subjective image scores (P > 0.05). The number of
      vessels in the optimal enhancement range counts more in the experimental group
      than in the control group (chi2 value = 334.25, P 0.05). In the control group, a 
      weak to medium correlation was seen between vascular enhancement and BMI (r =
      -0.20), BW (r = -0.42), BSA (r = -0.46), and BV (r = -0.48) (P 0.05 for all).
      Conclusions: Compared to BW, BSA, and BV, a weaker negative correlation exists
      between vascular enhancement and BMI when ATVS selects 70 KV. However, as a much 
      easier way to operate, the stepped low flow and low-contrast agent injection
      based on BMI was feasible, and the image quality was more homogenized than that
      of the control group.

LID - 10.1155/2022/9624339 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To investigate the risk factors of radial artery obstruction after
      repeated right radial coronary interventions. Methods: 497 patients who underwent
      repeated coronary intervention via the right radial artery in our hospital from
      January 2017 to January 2021 were selected and followed up for 28.07 +/- 6.07
      months. According to whether the right radial artery was obstructed or not, they 
      were divided into radial artery occlusion group (n = 48) and nonradial artery
      occlusion group (n = 449). Results: The proportion of patients with diabetes
      mellitus, elevated D-dimer, and elevated LDL cholesterol was higher in the radial
      artery occlusion group than in the nonradial artery occlusion group (p < 0.05).
      The radial artery occlusion group had more passage through the right radial
      artery often and had a longer cumulative sheath retention time than the radial
      artery occlusion group (p < 0.05). Cumulative sheath retention time (hours) had a
      high predictive value for radial artery occlusion. The optimal diagnostic limit
      for radial artery occlusion was 2.75 h, with a sensitivity of 77.1% and a
      specificity of 79.5% (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Diabetes mellitus, elevated D-dimer,
      elevated LDL cholesterol, and long retention sheath time predispose to radial
      artery occlusion. Cumulative duration of sheath retention is a predictor of
      radial artery occlusion.

AB  - Introduction: Drug-related problems (DRPs) refer to events or circumstances
      involving drug therapy that actually or potentially interfere with desired health
      outcomes. DRPs might be severe for children with chronic diseases managed at
      primary health care institutions, but the relevant research is scarce. Objective:
      In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to explore the prevalence, types, causes,
      and influencing factors of DRPs in children with chronic diseases in a Chinese
      primary health care institution. Methods: We recruited children with chronic
      diseases who visited the pediatric outpatient department in a primary health care
      institution from July 1 to 12 October 2021. Clinical pharmacists identified DRPs 
      through medication therapy reviews, classified the types and causes of DRPs, and 
      distinguished the manifested DRPs that affected the outcome and potential DRPs
      that were going to affect the outcome. Results: A total of 188 children with
      chronic diseases was included, and 584 DRPs were identified in 89.89% of
      participants. The most common type of DRPs was "treatment effectiveness" (a
      manifested problem or potential problem with the effect of the pharmacotherapy;
      83.56%), of which 67.29% were potential DRPs. The second common type was
      "treatment safety" (patient suffers or could suffer from an adverse drug event;
      14.21%), of which 89.16% were potential DRPs. The most common cause of DRPs was
      related to the process of use (42.24%), such as "patient uses/takes less drug
      than prescribed or does not take the drug at all," "patient stores drug
      inappropriately," and "patient administers/uses the drug in a wrong way." The
      second common cause was related to the process of dispensing (29.83%), such as
      "necessary information not provided or incorrect advice provided" and "prescribed
      drug is not available." The third common cause was related to the process of
      prescribing (26.21%), such as "drug dose is too low" and "no or incomplete drug
      treatment despite an existing indication." The number of combined medications was
      an influencing factor for the frequency of DRPs (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This
      cross-sectional study showed that the current situation regarding DRPs among
      children with chronic diseases managed in the primary health care institution was
      serious. The types of DRPs were mainly related to treatment effectiveness, and
      improper usage of medications was one of the main causes of DRPs. The number of
      combined drugs was the influencing factor for the frequency of DRPs. In the
      future, pharmacists should consider formulating pharmaceutical intervention
      strategies for this specific group according to the characteristics of DRPs.

AB  - Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive
      lymphoma subtype worldwide and occurs frequently in the elderly population.
      However, there are limited data on the clinical profiles of patients with DLBCL
      over 70 years of age. Our objective was to summarize the clinical
      characteristics, treatment strategies and survival outcomes of this population in
      China. Methods: This multicenter retrospective study was conducted in China from 
      January 2012 to July 2020 to investigate the clinical characteristics and
      survival outcomes. A total of 239 patients with DLBCL aged over 70 years
      underwent pretreatment evaluations, treatment, and follow-up at local hospitals. 
      The primary endpoints were the progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall
      survival (OS) rates at 2 years. Secondary endpoints included median PFS and OS,
      the estimated PFS and OS rates at 5 years, and adverse events during treatment.
      Results: With a median follow-up of 50 months (range, 1-102 months), the 2-year
      PFS and OS rates were 53.0% and 65.5%, respectively. The median PFS and OS were
      42.1 and 96.4 months, respectively; and the estimated 5-year PFS and OS rates
      were 44.7% and 56.1%, respectively. Hematological toxicities were the most common
      adverse effects in this study, accounting for 90.4%; and leukopenia was the most 
      frequently observed >/= grade 3 event. Furthermore, we found that regimens
      without rituximab and chemotherapy cycles < 6 were significantly associated with 
      worse survival. Additionally, in the 70-80-year group, reduction in chemotherapy 
      dose was associated with a significantly shorter OS, with a 2-year OS rate of
      74.4% in the full dose group, compared to 67.1% for the decreased-dose group (p =
      0.044). Conclusion: Our study presents the clinical profiles and survival
      outcomes of elderly patients with DLBCL in China. Treatment of these patients
      requires careful evaluation of toxicities and benefits. To this end, a prognosis 
      model, such as comprehensive geriatric assessment, is required in clinical
      practice to optimally manage elderly patients with DLBCL.

TI  - Frequencies, Modalities, Doses and Duration of Computerized Prescriptions for
      Sedative, Analgesic, Anesthetic and Paralytic Drugs in Neonates Requiring
      Intensive Care: A Prospective Pharmacoepidemiologic Cohort Study in 30 French
      NICUs From 2014 to 2020.
PG  - 939869

AB  - Objectives: No consensus exists about the doses of analgesics, sedatives,
      anesthetics, and paralytics used in critically ill neonates. Large-scale,
      detailed pharmacoepidemiologic studies of prescription practices are a
      prerequisite to future research. This study aimed to describe the detailed
      prescriptions of these drug classes in neonates hospitalized in neonatal
      intensive care units (NICU) from computerized prescription records and to compare
      prescriptions by gestational age. Materials and Methods: We included all neonates
      requiring intensive care in 30 French level III units from 2014 through 2020 with
      a computerized prescription for an analgesic, sedative, anesthetic, or paralytic 
      agent. We described frequencies of prescription, methods of administration,
      concomitant drug prescriptions, and dosing regimen, and compared them across
      gestational ages. Results: Among 65,555 neonates, 29,340 (44.8%) were prescribed 
      at least one analgesic (acetaminophen in 37.2% and opioids in 17.8%), sedative
      (9.8%), anesthetic (8.5%), and/or paralytic agent (1%). Among preterm infants
      born before 28 weeks, 3,771/4,283 (88.0%) were prescribed at least one of these
      agents: 69.7% opioids, 41.2% sedatives, 32.5% anesthetics, and 5.8% paralytics.
      The most frequently prescribed agents were sufentanil (in 10.3% of neonates) and 
      morphine (in 8.0% of neonates) for opioids, midazolam (9.3%) for sedatives,
      ketamine (5.7%) and propofol (3.3%) for anesthetics. In most neonates, opioids
      and sedatives were prescribed as continuous infusion, whereas anesthetics were
      prescribed as single doses. Opioids, sedatives and paralytics were mostly
      prescribed in association with another agent. Doses varied significantly by
      gestational age but within a limited range. Gestational age was inversely related
      to the frequency, cumulative dose and duration of prescriptions. For example,
      morphine prescriptions showed median (IQR) cumulative doses of 2601 (848-6750)
      vs. 934 (434-2679) microg/kg and median (IQR) durations of 7 (3-15) vs. 3 (2-5)
      days in infants born <28 vs. >/= 37 weeks of gestation, respectively
      (p-value<0.001). Conclusion: The prescriptions of analgesic, sedative,
      anesthetic, or paralytic agent were frequent and often combined in the NICU.
      Lower gestational age was associated with higher frequencies, longer durations
      and higher cumulative doses of these prescriptions. Dose-finding studies to
      determine individualized dosing regimens and studies on long-term
      neurodevelopmental outcome according to received cumulative doses are required.

TI  - Neuroprotective Effects of Oligosaccharides From Periplaneta Americana on
      Parkinson's Disease Models In Vitro and In Vivo.
PG  - 936818
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.936818 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases that is
      characterized by obvious motor and some nonmotor symptoms. Various therapeutics
      failed in the effective treatment of PD because of impaired neurological function
      in the brain and various complications. Periplaneta Americana oligosaccharides
      (OPA), the main active ingredients extracted from the medicine residues of
      Periplaneta Americana (P. Americana), have been reported to exert
      anti-inflammatory effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible
      mechanisms of OPA against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced apotosis
      in SH-SY5Y cells and its potential neuroprotective effects in
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD subacute model
      mice. The data demonstrated that OPA significantly reversed the MPP(+)-induced
      decrease in SH-SY5Y cell viability, reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells,
      and protected SH-SY5Y cells from apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner by
      regulating the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Furthermore, OPA also
      alleviated the motor dysfunction of PD model mice, prevented the loss of tyrosine
      hydroxylase positive cells, suppressed the apoptosis of substantia nigra cells,
      and improved the dysbiosis of gut microbiota in vivo, suggesting that OPA
      demonstrated a significantly neuroprotective effect on PD model mice. These
      results indicated that OPA might be the possibility of PD therapeutics with
      economic utility and high safety.

AB  - Background and aims: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is infection-induced
      inflammation of the female upper reproductive tract that results in high fever,
      ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and varying degrees of chronic pelvic pain.
      Recent clinical studies have shown that Kangfuxiaoyanshuan (KFXYS), a Traditional
      Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulation, may short the course of the disease and
      reduce the occurrence of PID sequelae, but its pharmacological action and
      potential mechanism have not been fully elucidated. Here, we aimed to investigate
      the therapeutic effects and mechanism of KFXYS in rats with PID. Materials and
      Methods: A PID rat model was constructed through endometrial mechanical injury
      and pathogen infection. The rectal temperature was measured during the 14-days
      course of treatment, and the white blood cell (WBC) count in the blood and the
      levels of cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-4, TNF-alpha) in the serum were
      evaluated by ELISA. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed to analyze 
      pathological changes, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to
      observe ultrastructural changes. The p-p65/p65 protein expression was evaluated
      by western blotting and the levels of MMP-2 and TGF-beta in adhesion tissues were
      assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: KFXYS lowered the rectal temperature
      and the WBC counts in the blood in the acute stage of PID and alleviated
      inflammatory cell infiltration of the uterus, especially when combined with
      levofloxacin. KFXYS significantly decreased the levels of proinflammatory
      cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-4) and adhesion-related factors (TNF-alpha)
      and protected the ultrastructure of endometrial epithelial cells.
      Mechanistically, KFXYS inhibited the NF-kappaB activation by decreasing
      phosphorylation of p65, thus the alleviation of inflammation further reduced the 
      expression of TGF-beta and MMP-2, and inhibited the occurrence of uterine
      adhesions. Conclusion: These results revealed that KFXYS alleviated pelvic
      inflammation and effectively inhibits inflammation-associated adhesion, which
      indicated the potential role of KFXYS for treatment of PID and the prevention of 
      PID sequelae.

AB  - Background: Evidence have shown that gut microbiota plays an important role in
      the development of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). In addition, matrix
      metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) plays an important role in intestinal injury in SAP.
      Thus, we aimed to determine whether gut microbiota could regulate the intestinal 
      injury during SAP via modulating MMP9. Methods: In this study, the fecal samples 
      of patients with SAP (n = 72) and healthy controls (n = 32) were analyzed by 16S 
      rRNA gene sequencing. In addition, to investigate the association between gut
      microbiota and MMP9 in intestinal injury during SAP, we established MMP9 stable
      knockdown Caco2 and HT29 cells in vitro and generated a MMP9 knockout (MMP9-/-)
      mouse model of SAP in vivo. Results: We found that the abundance of Clostridium
      butyricum (C. butyricum) was significantly decreased in the SAP group. In
      addition, overexpression of MMP9 notably downregulated the expressions of tight
      junction proteins and upregulated the expressions of p-p38 and p-ERK in Caco2 and
      HT29 cells (p < 0.05). However, C. butyricum or butyrate treatment remarkably
      upregulated the expressions of tight junction proteins and downregulated the
      expressions of MMP9, p-p38 and p-ERK in MMP9-overexpressed Caco2 and HT29 cells
      (p < 0.05). Importantly, C. butyricum or butyrate could not affect the
      expressions of tight junction proteins, and MMP9, p-p38 and p-ERK proteins in
      MMP9-knockdown cells compared with MMP9-knockdown group. Consistently, C.
      butyricum or butyrate could not attenuate pancreatic and intestinal injury during
      SAP in MMP9-/- mice compared with the SAP group. Conclusion: Collectively, C.
      butyricum could protect against pancreatic and intestinal injury after SAP via
      downregulation of MMP9 in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Mitochondrial Oxygenation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 785734
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.785734 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Adequate oxygenation is essential for the preservation of organ
      function during cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Both hypoxia
      and hyperoxia result in undesired outcomes, and a narrow window for optimal
      oxygenation exists. Current perioperative monitoring techniques are not always
      sufficient to monitor adequate oxygenation. The non-invasive COMET((R)) monitor
      could be a tool to monitor oxygenation by measuring the cutaneous mitochondrial
      oxygen tension (mitoPO2). This pilot study examines the feasibility of cutaneous 
      mitoPO2 measurements during cardiothoracic procedures. Cutaneous mitoPO2 will be 
      compared to tissue oxygenation (StO2) as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. 
      Design and Method: This single-center observational study examined 41 cardiac
      surgery patients requiring CPB. Preoperatively, patients received a
      5-aminolevulinic acid plaster on the upper arm to enable mitoPO2 measurements.
      After induction of anesthesia, both cutaneous mitoPO2 and StO2 were measured
      throughout the procedure. The patients were observed until discharge for the
      development of acute kidney insufficiency (AKI). Results: Cutaneous mitoPO2 was
      successfully measured in all patients and was 63.5 [40.0-74.8] mmHg at the
      surgery start and decreased significantly (p < 0.01) to 36.4 [18.4-56.0] mmHg by 
      the end of the CPB run. StO2 at the surgery start was 80.5 [76.8-84.3]% and did
      not change significantly. Cross-clamping of the aorta and the switch to
      non-pulsatile flow resulted in a median cutaneous mitoPO2 decrease of 7 mmHg (p <
      0.01). The cessation of the aortic cross-clamping period resulted in an increase 
      of 4 mmHg (p < 0.01). Totally, four patients developed AKI and had a lower
      preoperative eGFR of 52 vs. 81 ml/min in the non-AKI group. The AKI group spent
      32% of the operation time with a cutaneous mitoPO2 value under 20 mmHg as
      compared to 8% in the non-AKI group. Conclusion: This pilot study illustrated the
      feasibility of measuring cutaneous mitoPO2 using the COMET((R)) monitor during
      cardiothoracic procedures. Moreover, in contrast to StO2, mitoPO2 decreased
      significantly with the increasing CPB run time. Cutaneous mitoPO2 also
      significantly decreased during the aortic cross-clamping period and increased
      upon the release of the clamp, but StO2 did not. This emphasized the sensitivity 
      of cutaneous mitoPO2 to detect circulatory and microvascular changes.

TI  - A rare case of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy associated with
      LAMA2 mutation: A case report and literature review.
PG  - 922347
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.922347 [doi]
AB  - Background: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heritable
      heart muscle disorder that predominantly affects the right ventricle. Mutations
      in genes that encode components of desmosomes, the adhesive junctions that
      connect cardiomyocytes, are the predominant cause of ARVC. A case with novel
      heterozygous mutation in the LAMA2 gene is reported here. The protein encoded by 
      LAMA2 gene is the alpha2 chain of laminin-211 protein, which establishes a stable
      relationship between the muscle fiber membrane and the extracellular matrix. We
      explored the potential mechanism and the relationship between the mutation and
      ARVC. Case Presentation: At the age of 8, the patient developed syncope and
      palpitation after exercise. Dynamic electrocardiogram recorded continuous
      premature ventricular beats, and MRI showed the right ventricle was significantly
      enlarged and there were many localized distensions at the edge of the right
      ventricular wall. The patient was diagnosed with ARVC and received heart
      transplantation at the age of 14 due to severe heart dysfunction. The myocardial 
      histological pathological staining revealed a large amount of fibrosis and
      adipose migration. Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified the heterozygous
      mutation in the LAMA2 gene [NM_000426.3: c.8842G > A (p.G2948S)]. This is the
      first report of these variants. Analysis was performed on genetic disorders to
      reveal splice site changes and damage to protein structure. LAMA2 p.G2948S
      predicted unstable protein structure and impaired function. Induced pluripotent
      stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) were established. RNA-seq and the
      western blot were performed on IPSC-CMs to explore the ARVC-related signaling
      pathway. Conclusion: This is the first case report to describe an ARVC phenotype 
      in patients possessing a novel LAMA2 c.8842G > A (p.G2948S) mutation. Our results
      aid in understanding of the pathogenesis of ARVC. The molecular mechanism of
      LAMA2 leading to ARVC disease still needs further study.

      Aortic Dissection.
PG  - 367-373
LID - 10.2147/OAEM.S373335 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a highly fatal disorder if not promptly
      diagnosed. Some international studies have suggested that serum d-dimer levels
      may be used to exclude AAD, but data are limited. We sought to confirm that
      d-dimer levels are elevated in American patients with AAD. Additionally, we
      sought to estimate the test characteristics of the d-dimer for AAD. Patients and 
      Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients in the Hospital
      Corporation of America database who arrived at the hospital between 2015 and
      2019. We queried the database to find patients who had a diagnosis of AAD or
      (nonspecific) chest pain, and who also had a d-dimer performed within 24 hours of
      arrival at the hospital. The median d-dimer was compared in those diagnosed with 
      AAD versus chest pain. We estimated the test characteristics of d-dimer for AAD
      at the standard cutoff value of 500 ng/mL. Results: In total, 48,902 patients met
      the criteria for analysis, including 572 with AAD and 48,330 with chest pain. The
      median d-dimers were 2455 ng/mL and 385 ng/mL for the AAD and chest pain groups, 
      respectively (p < 0.0001). Using a cutoff of 500 ng/mL, the sensitivity of the
      d-dimer was 91.1% and the specificity was 71.4%. Conclusion: Serum d-dimer values
      are higher in patients with AAD than in those with nonspecific chest pain. At the
      standard cutoff of 500 ng/mL, the serum d-dimer has a high sensitivity for AAD,
      but not high enough that d-dimer levels alone can be used in isolation to exclude
      AAD.

      Departments.
PG  - 355-366
LID - 10.2147/OAEM.S371237 [doi]
AB  - Background: In Thailand, most primary care hospitals cannot measure serum lipase 
      and amylase; no 24 hours computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging
      available, and no on-call gastroenterologists. Thus, acute pancreatitis cannot be
      diagnosed based on the established diagnostic criteria that require this
      information. The resultant delayed management increases morbidity and mortality. 
      This study was performed to create a clinical prediction score for early
      diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in emergency departments without requiring a
      computed tomography scan or laboratory measurement to assist in the initial
      diagnosis, treatment, or referral. Methods: Patients with suspected acute
      pancreatitis who had available data regarding lipase and amylase measurements and
      visited the emergency department from June 2019 to August 2020 were
      retrospectively analyzed. The baseline predictive factors were compared between
      patients with and without acute pancreatitis according to the 2012 revised
      Atlanta classification. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore
      potential predictive factors and develop a clinical prediction score for the
      diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Results: A total of 506 eligible patients, 84
      (16%) had acute pancreatitis. The PRE-PAN score [area under the receiver
      operating characteristics curve, 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.84-0.93]
      included six factors: alcohol drinking, epigastric pain, pain radiating to the
      back, persistent pain, nausea or vomiting, and the pain score. A score of >7.5
      points suggested a high probability of acute pancreatitis [positive likelihood
      ratio, 6.80 (95% CI, 4.75-9.34; p < 0.001); sensitivity, 66.7% (95% CI,
      54.6-77.3); specificity, 90.2% (95% CI, 86.6-93.1); positive predictive value,
      58.5% (95% CI, 47.1-69.3);, 92.9% (95% CI, 89.6-95.4)]. Conclusion: A PRE-PAN
      risk score is a screening tool for predicting acute pancreatitis without using
      the lipase concentration or radiological findings. A high predictive score,
      especially >7.5, suggests a high probability of acute pancreatitis.

AB  - Purpose: Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is emerging globally and can 
      cause various infections. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and
      microbiological characteristics of bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by hvKP.
      Patients and Methods: The clinical data of hospitalized patients with K.
      pneumoniae BSI were retrospectively analyzed. The K. pneumoniae strains were
      collected and re-identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was
      performed using the broth microdilution method. Capsular serotypes and virulence 
      genes were detected using polymerase chain reaction, and hvKP was defined as
      aerobactin positive. Molecular typing was done by multilocus sequence typing. The
      hvKP and classic K. pneumoniae (cKP) subgroups were compared. Results: Of the 66 
      nonrepetitive BSI K. pneumoniae strains included, 29 (43.9%) were hvKP. In these 
      BSI hvKP strains, salmochelin and yersiniabactin accounted for 86.2% and 72.4%,
      respectively. The prevalence of rmpA, iroBCD cluster, ybtS, clbA, and allS was
      89.7%, 86.2%, 72.4%, 51.7%, and 41.4%, respectively, which were all significantly
      different between the hvKP and cKP subgroups. Serotypes K1 and K2 were strongly
      associated with hypervirulence (P < 0.05). Nineteen sequence types were scattered
      in the 29 hvKP strains, and the most common was ST23 (24.1%). None of the hvKP
      strains were carbapenem resistant. Compared with cKP, hvKP was more capable of
      developing a liver abscess. However, the 30-day mortality rate was lower (13.8%
      vs 21.6%) in the hvKP subgroup than in the cKP subgroup. Conclusion: This study
      demonstrated a high proportion of hvKP in BSI K. pneumoniae, most of which were
      RmpA and siderophore producing, and of multiclonal origin.

      Surgery with Suspected of Surgical Site Nosocomial Infection North East Ethiopia.
PG  - 3949-3965
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S376622 [doi]
AB  - Background: Antibiotic resistance is becoming a global issue, with estimated 2.8 
      million people in the United States developing antibiotic-resistant diseases each
      year. The carriage of ESBL and Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae among
      hospitalized patients is a threat to the future of antibiotic treatment.
      Objective: Multi-drug resistance profile, prevalence of extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase and Carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli among admitted
      patients after surgery with suspected surgical site nosocomial infection north
      east Ethiopia. Material and Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was
      conducted from April 2021 to February 2022. Socio-demographic and clinical data
      were assessed using a structured questionnaire. A total of 384 relevant clinical 
      samples (pus, pus aspirates, and wound swabs) were collected aseptically and
      processed within 30 min by placing the swabs into the sterile test tubes having
      0.5 mL of sterile normal saline. The samples were cultured on MacConkey agar,
      chocolate agar and blood agar, and species identification was done using standard
      biochemical tests. Disk diffusion antimicrobial sensitivity test was done on
      Mueller-Hinton agar. All the cefoxitin resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates were
      checked for the presence of AmpC beta-lactamase using four cartridges of disk
      diffusion tablets. ESBL output validation was conducted by the combination disk
      test. The production of Carbapenemase was checked using modified carbapenem
      inactivation method. Results: The prevalence of significant bacterial nosocomial 
      infection among surgical site infection 343 (89.32%). S. aureus 125 (36.4%) was
      predominant followed by E. coli 80 (23.3%) P. aeruginosa 31 (9.03%). The overall 
      MDR rate of isolated bacteria was 251 (73.3%). About 150 (73.9%) bacteria were
      suspected for ESBL production and 67 (33%) AmpC beta-lactamase and 27 (13.3%)
      Carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacterial, respectively. Conclusions and
      Recommendations: The severity of ESBL-PE was critical, and the CPE was alarming. 
      Meropenem and imipenem were the most effective antibiotics against ESBL-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae. Therefore, strict infection prevention and control measures
      are needed.

      2013 to 2019.
PG  - 4047-4058
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S332997 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To investigate the incidence of acute postoperative endophthalmitis
      (POE) after cataract surgery in Northern China from 2013 to 2019, evaluate the
      efficacy of prophylaxis and analyze the predictors of visual prognosis among POE 
      patients. Methods: The study was conducted as a retrospective multi-center
      research, with seven hospitals in Northern China enrolled. The diagnosis of
      acute-onset POE was made on the basis of clinical manifestations within six weeks
      after initial surgery. By reviewing electronic medical system, the number of
      cataract surgeries and acute POE cases were recorded to estimate the overall
      incidence and incidences by different years and hospitals. Perioperative measures
      for preventing infection in different hospitals were collected. The correlations 
      between unfavorable final vision and potential factors including basic
      information and clinical characteristics were examined to determine the
      predictive factors for final visual prognosis. Results: Of 72,255 cataract
      surgeries performed during seven years in the seven hospitals, 19 cases developed
      acute POE, yielding an overall incidence of 0.026%. The average incidence of
      acute POE among seven hospitals significantly declined annually during the past 7
      years (p = 0.021). In Hospital-D, the incidence of acute POE significantly
      decreased after the application of 0.5% povidone-iodine (PVP-I) for conjunctival 
      washing (p = 0.003). Two hospitals adopting tobramycin in the irrigation solution
      achieved a significant lower incidence of POE than the other hospitals (p =
      0.044). The positive rate of pathogen culture was just 17.6% (3/19). Patients
      with presenting BCVA of CF or better were more likely to present with unfavorable
      final vision than those with worse presenting BCVA (p = 0.003). Conclusion: The
      overall incidence of acute POE after cataract surgery from 2013 to 2019 in
      Northern China was 0.026%, and the incidence declined annually over the period.
      Presenting BCVA could be a significant prognosis factor for predicting the final 
      visual outcomes of acute POE patients.

      Co-Infected Patients: A Systematic Review of Case Reports.
PG  - 4037-4046
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S370837 [doi]
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis
      (MTB) are among the top ongoing health crises globally. Both cause respiratory
      diseases, and the clinical presentations are similar. There is no summarized
      information about cases of COVID-19 patients with concomitant TB infection from
      different settings. Therefore this review aimed to summerize the clinical
      features and treatment outcomes of coronavirus and tuberculosis co-infected
      patients. Methods: An electronic search of case reports published between 2020
      and 2021 was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect.
      From eligible reports, data were collected for the selected variables. We
      analyzed the collected information using SPSS version 27 software. Descriptive
      statistics were computed for the selected variables. Results: A total of 83
      patient histories were collected from 47 case reports. The majority (80%) of the 
      cases were reported for male patients. The mean age was 42.6 years (3 months to
      84 years, SD=17.3). Fever was reported in 80% of cases, followed by cough (73.3%)
      and hypotension (37.1%). Blood cell parameters revealed lymphopenia (52%), lower 
      hemoglobin (30%), elevated CRP (70%), elevated ferritin (28%), and increased
      D-dimer (23.4%). Treatment outcome is significantly associated with blood cell
      count results (p-0.044) and a rise in blood inflammatory cytokines(p-0.041). The 
      mean days for viral clearance or negative PCR was 23 days (Range 5-82 days) and
      the overall mean duration of hospitalization was 27 days. The total death rate
      was 22.4%. Recovery was reported for 76.6% of cases. Survival status (p-0.613)
      and disease severity (p-0.68) are not significantly associated with the gender of
      the participants. Conclusion: An alteration in blood cell parameters is
      associated with an unfavorable treatment outcome. There is a higher death rate in
      COVID-19/TB co-infection. The death is associated with older age, smoking or
      smoking history, drug abuse, and co-morbidity of non-communicable diseases.
      Conversely, there is a lower death rate in HIV patients.

AB  - Verruca plantaris (plantar wart) is a type of benign feet hyperplasia that is
      caused by a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. In this study, we aimed to
      assess the clinical efficacy underlying cantharidin cream in the treatment of
      Verruca plantaris compared to CO2 laser and liquid nitrogen cryotherapy. One
      hundred and fifty patients affected with Verruca plantaris were enrolled in this 
      retrospective clinical study. The treatment efficacy rate in the three groups was
      assessed 4 and 12 weeks after treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, 46 cases in 
      the externally applied cantharidin cream therapy group were cured with an
      apparent efficiency of 92.0% (46/50). Contrarily, 42 cases in the CO2 laser group
      were cured with 84.0% (42/50) efficiency, while 40 cases in the liquid nitrogen
      cryotherapy group were cured with an apparent efficiency of 80.0% (40/50).
      Although the clinical cure rate of Verruca plantaris in the Cantharidin group was
      greater than in the CO2 laser group and in the liquid nitrogen cryotherapy group,
      there were no statistical differences found among the three groups (P = 0.225).
      After 12 weeks of treatment, 43 cases in the external cantharidin cream therapy
      group were cured with an apparent efficiency of 86.0% (43/50). Similarly, 39
      cases in the CO2 laser group were cured with an apparent efficiency of 78.0%
      (39/50), while 36 cases in the liquid nitrogen cryotherapy group were cured with 
      an apparent efficiency of 72.0% (36/50). The statistical differences among the
      three groups were not found (P =0.230), but the resolution rate of warts in
      Cantharidin group was the highest among the three groups. The results from this
      study demonstrated that external cantharidin cream therapy could be served as an 
      alternative treatment for Verruca plantaris.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 
      low-dose interferon alpha-2a (IFNalpha2a) in Behcet's syndrome (BS) patients with
      refractory vascular/cardiac or neurological involvement. Methods: In this
      retrospective cohort study, we consecutively included 25 BS patients with
      refractory vascular/cardiac (n = 16) or neurological involvement (n = 9) who
      received IFNalpha2a treatment in our center between June 2018 and September 2021.
      The low-dose IFNalpha2a (3 million IU, every other day) was used as an add-on
      treatment with the continuation of glucocorticoids (GCs) and immunosuppressants. 
      Results: In total, 25 patients (20 males, 5 females) with a mean age of 31.92 +/-
      9.25 years were included. IFNalpha2a was administered for BS patients with
      refractory vascular/cardiac involvement (n = 16) and neurological involvement (n 
      = 9). Before the initiation of IFNalpha2a, patients had insufficient response or 
      intolerance to conventional therapies. After a median follow-up of 23
      [interquartile range (IQR), 11-30] months, all patients achieved clinical
      improvement. The Behcet's disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) score improved
      significantly (5 versus 0, median, p < 0.0001). BS Overall Damage Index (BODI)
      and vasculitis damage index (VDI) remain stable (p > 0.05). Decrease in
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR; 24 (IQR, 12-43.5) versus 5 (IQR, 2.75-10.5) 
      mm/h, p = 0.0001] and C-reactive protein [CRP; 6.64 (IQR, 3.67-19.82) versus 1.24
      (IQR, 0.24-3.12) mg/liter, p < 0.005] was achieved effectively. The median GCs
      dosage tapered from 26.25 (IQR, 11.88-41.25) to 10.00 (IQR, 7.50-10.63) mg/d, p <
      0.0001. Immunosuppressants were also reduced in number (p < 0.005). No serious
      adverse events were observed during follow-up. Conclusion: Our study suggests
      that low-dose IFNalpha2a, combined with GCs and immunosuppressants, is
      well-tolerated and effective for BS patients with refractory vascular/cardiac or 
      neurological involvement and has a steroid- and immunosuppressant-sparing effect.

AB  - Background: The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) assessment test
      (CAT) measures the health status of patients with COPD. We aimed to investigate
      the change in individual CAT scores after short-term bronchodilator therapy among
      treatment-naive patients with COPD. Methods: Data from 148 patients newly
      diagnosed with COPD between January 2016 and April 2020 were retrospectively
      analyzed. We compared the CAT score, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC)
      dyspnea grade, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) before and after
      short-term (6 +/- 2 months) bronchodilator therapy. We analyzed the change trends
      using generalized estimating equations. Results: The mean patient age was 70.9
      years, and 92.6% were male. The total CAT score did not significantly improve.
      However, among the CAT items, phlegm [adjusted difference: -0.22 (-0.48,
      -0.002)], chest tightness [-0.30 (-0.56, -0.05)], and breathlessness [-0.45
      (-0.66, -0.23)] scores significantly improved after bronchodilator therapy. The
      patients were divided into two groups: CAT score improved (n = 69) and not
      improved group (n = 79). The development of moderate-to-severe exacerbations
      during follow-up was significantly lower (2.9% versus 17.7%, p = 0.004) in the
      CAT score improved group. Conclusion: The improvement in CAT items indicating
      respiratory symptoms was more evident than the CAT total score after short-term
      bronchodilator therapy. Despite the significant increase in FEV1 after
      bronchodilator therapy, fewer than half of the patients achieved meaningful
      improvement in CAT, and this group showed significantly lower development of
      exacerbation during follow-up.

AB  - Introduction: About one-third of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients do
      not exhibit complete response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Some of these
      patients were reported to benefit from the combination therapy of fibrates and
      UDCA, but more clinical evidence is required. In this study, we conducted a
      randomized, controlled trial on the safety and efficacy of fenofibrate in the
      treatment of patients with PBC. Methods: Forty-eight PBC patients with incomplete
      response to UDCA were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups (24 in the
      experiment group and 24 in the control group). For the experimental group, the
      patients were administered 13-15 mg/kg/day UDCA in combination with 200 mg/day
      fenofibrate. For the control group, the patients continued to receive UDCA at
      13-15 mg/kg/day. The patients were followed up for at least 12 months. The serum 
      levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT),
      aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and other biochemical parameters were measured 
      at 3, 6, and 12 months during the trial to assess patient conditions. Results: At
      12 months, 20.8% of the patients in the experimental group had all three indexes 
      of serum ALP, gamma-GT, and total bilirubin normalized, while 0% of patients in
      the control group reached the primary outcome (difference, 20.8 percentage
      points; 95% CI, 4.6-37.0). 54.2% of the patients had normal ALP levels in the
      experimental group and 4.2% in the control group (difference, 50 percentage
      points; 95% CI, 28.5-71.5). The experimental group had greater improvement of ALP
      (p < 0.001) and IgG (p = 0.026) than the control group. The biochemical indexes
      of the patients in the experimental group also significantly improved during the 
      treatment of fenofibrate. Conclusion: Addition of fenofibrate can improve
      biochemical indexes of PBC patients who had an incomplete response to UDCA.
      Reversible elevation of serum creatine and transaminases is observed in some
      patients.The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR)
      as ChiCTR1800020160 (protocol available online:
      http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=32443).

AB  - Background: Different fixation techniques are established for first
      metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) arthrodesis, including compression screws,
      plates, Kirschner wires, metal- and bioabsorbable screws as well as staples. The 
      purpose of this study was to investigate and present first clinical and
      radiologic results using a novel human, allogeneic cortical bone screw for
      arthrodesis of the first MTPJ. Methods: Arthrodesis of the first MTPJ was
      performed in 31 patients with hallux rigidus. Percentage union and time to union 
      were the first outcomes; visual analog scale for pain, hallux valgus angle (HVA),
      intermetatarsal angle, and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS)
      hallux score were secondary outcomes. Results: Median time to union was 89 days, 
      and union was observed in all patients. There were 4 complications (2 osteolysis 
      margin, 1 cystic brightening, and 1 severe swelling at the first follow-up) all
      of that resolved at last follow-up. Pain significantly decreased from visual
      analog scale 8.0 to 0.2 points (P < .0001). The HVA decreased from 30.4 to 10.2
      degrees in the patient group with deformities. The total AOFAS score increased
      significantly from 48 to 87 (P < .0001). Conclusion: Primary and revision
      arthrodesis of hallux rigidus with the human, allogeneic cortical bone screw
      reveals satisfying results similar to clinical and radiologic outcomes of other
      surgical techniques. Within 1 year, the human, allogeneic cortical bone screw is 
      fully remodeled to host bone. Level of Evidence: Level IV, retrospective case
      series without control group.

TI  - Evaluating the Quality and Reliability of Gender-affirming Surgery Videos on
      YouTube and TikTok.
PG  - e4443
LID - 10.1097/GOX.0000000000004443 [doi]
AB  - Background: Social media platforms have changed the way medical information is
      disseminated. Transgender patients may utilize social media to learn about
      gender-affirming surgery (GAS). Although videos on social media are readily
      accessible, their content is not verified or peer-reviewed. Therefore, this study
      aimed to evaluate the quality and reliability of YouTube and TikTok videos
      related to GAS. Methods: YouTube and TikTok were queried for gender-affirming top
      surgery, metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, breast augmentation, and vaginoplasty.
      Quality of video content was analyzed by the DISCERN scale. Quality scores were
      compared among the type of GAS, account user, and content category. Results:
      There were 275 YouTube videos and 55 TikTok videos. Most videos focused on
      masculinizing top surgery (P < 0.001). Overall, videos on masculinizing GAS had
      higher quality and reliability than videos on feminizing GAS (P < 0.001). Chest
      surgery videos were of higher quality than those on genital surgery (P </=
      0.001). Videos on masculinizing top surgery had the highest quality, whereas
      vaginoplasty had the lowest quality and reliability (P < 0.001). Videos produced 
      by health care professionals and academic institutions had the greatest quality
      and reliability, respectively (P < 0.0001), whereas videos produced by patients
      were the least reliable (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Videos on GAS ranged from poor
      to good quality and reliability. Health care professionals, especially plastic
      surgeons, should create high-quality videos on social media to educate
      transgender patients. There should also be greater efforts in disseminating
      existing high-quality videos on social media. Resources posted on social media
      platforms can reach a wide audience through accessible means.

      High-definition Liposuction (XPINE-FAT).
PG  - e4424
LID - 10.1097/GOX.0000000000004424 [doi]
AB  - Background: Knowledge about lower-back aesthetics is very limited, especially
      regarding surgical techniques that improve its appearance. Thus, this study aimed
      to describe a high-definition liposuction technique with intramuscular grafting
      of erector spinae muscles (longissimus). Methods: A total of 15 female patients
      25-48 years of age were recruited between November 2021 and January 2022, who
      underwent body contouring surgery and subsequently underwent a low-back
      lipodefinition and echo-guided intramuscular erector spinae (longissimus) fat
      graft to complement the procedure. As part of the study, measurements were
      performed before surgery and in the immediate postoperative period. The data were
      stored in a database and analyzed with the SPSS Version 25 statistical software. 
      Results: The patients' ages ranged from 25 to 48 years (mean: 37 years), with a
      body mass index of 18.6-29.3 (mean: 25.5). The surgical times ranged between 1
      and 8 hours (mean: 3.73 hours); hospitalization times were 0.7-1 days (mean:
      0.940 days). Lipograft was performed on the erector spinae muscles (longissimus),
      the right one with a range of 20-60 cm(3) (mean: 43.33 cm(3)) and percentage
      increase of 65.3% (P < 0.0001). Regarding the left erector, similar volumes
      between 20 and 60 cm(3) (mean: 44.67 cm(3)) were grafted with a percentage
      increase of 66.4% (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: XPINE-FAT is a safe technique that
      allows an increase in the immediate intramuscular thickness of the erector spinae
      muscles (longissimus). We observed no adverse events during the study.

TI  - Cleft Lip Repair Competence Can Be Evaluated with High-fidelity Simulation.
PG  - e4435
LID - 10.1097/GOX.0000000000004435 [doi]
AB  - Background: Demonstrating competency before independent practice is increasingly 
      important in surgery. This study tests the hypothesis that a high-fidelity cleft 
      lip simulator can be used to discriminate performance between training levels,
      demonstrating its utility for assessing procedural competence. Methods: During
      this prospective cohort study, participants performed a unilateral cleft lip
      repair on a high-fidelity simulator. Videos were blindly rated using the
      Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) and the Unilateral
      Cleft Lip Repair Competency Assessment Tool (UCLR). Digital measurement of
      symmetry was estimated. Influence of training level and cumulative prior
      experience on each score was estimated using Pearson r. Results: Participants (n 
      = 26) ranged from postgraduate year 3 to craniofacial fellow. Training level
      correlated best with UCLR (R = 0.4842, P = 0.0122*) and more weakly with OSATS (R
      = 0.3645, P = 0.0671), whereas cumulative prior experience only weakly correlated
      with UCLR (R = 0.3450, P = 0.0843) and not with OSATS (R = 0.1609, P = 0.4323).
      UCLR subscores indicated marking the repair had little correlation with training 
      level (R = 0.2802, P = 0.1656), whereas performance and result did (R = 0.5152, P
      = 0.0071*, R = 0.4226, P = 0.0315*, respectively). Correlation between symmetry
      measures and training level was weak. Conclusions: High-fidelity simulation
      paired with an appropriate procedure-specific assessment tool has the construct
      validity to evaluate performance for cleft lip repair. Simply being able to mark 
      a cleft lip repair is not an accurate independent assessment method nor is
      symmetry of the final result.

      Seeking Peripheral Nerve Surgery.
PG  - e4434
LID - 10.1097/GOX.0000000000004434 [doi]
AB  - Background: In peripheral nerve surgery, the presence of psychiatric diagnoses
      and medications may affect outcomes and perioperative neuropathic pain
      management. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of
      psychiatric diagnoses and chronic pain in patients referred to a peripheral nerve
      surgery clinic. Methods: This is a retrospective review of patients seen at a
      peripheral nerve clinic from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2021. Medical records were 
      reviewed for demographics; peripheral nerve diagnosis; psychiatric diagnoses;
      psychotropic prescriptions; use of nonneuroleptic/nonnarcotic, neuroleptic, and
      narcotic medications; and peripheral nerve surgical candidacy and outcome.
      Results: Six hundred twenty-two patients were included in this study. The most
      common reasons for referral were 24.8% lower extremity neuroma, 23.2% lower
      extremity compressive neuropathy, and 14.0% upper extremity compressive
      neuropathy. Of the included patients' 37.1% had a psychiatric diagnosis, and
      36.3% were taking a psychotropic medication. The percentage of patients taking
      chronic nonneuroleptic/nonnarcotic pain medications was 34.3%' with 42.8% taking 
      neuroleptic, and 24.9% narcotic medications. Patients with a psychiatric
      diagnosis were more likely to be taking neuroleptic (48.9% versus 38.9%, P <
      0.001) and narcotic pain medications (27.3% versus 17.4%, P = 0.004) and less
      likely to have a positive surgical outcome (65.7% versus 83.0%, P = 0.001).
      Conclusions: Patients referred to a peripheral nerve surgery clinic frequently
      have psychiatric diagnoses and take chronic psychotropic and chronic pain
      medications. Knowledge of this will best help the peripheral nerve surgeon
      evaluate a patient for surgery, optimize perioperative care, and safely and
      effectively manage expectations.

      Reduction of the Abdomen.
PG  - e4446
LID - 10.1097/GOX.0000000000004446 [doi]
AB  - Noninvasive body contouring has seen a precipitous rise in popularity since its
      advent in the early 2000s. With this rise in popularity, there has been an
      expansion in the types and number of noninvasive devices for muscle hypertrophy
      and fat lipolysis. The Transform radiofrequency and electrical muscle stimulation
      device is a newly introduced device for noninvasive abdominal body contouring.
      The present study is a prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of the 
      Transform device on abdominal circumference. Fifteen patients were enrolled and
      received three treatment sessions with the Transform device. On average, patients
      saw changes in abdominal circumference (-0.43 cm, P = 0.48), caliper pinch
      thickness (-6.07 mm, P = 0.0036), and ultrasound fat thickness (-5.40 mm, P <
      0.001) at 3 months posttreatment with minimal discomfort and high patient
      satisfaction. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that the Transform device is a 
      safe and effective noninvasive option for fat lipolysis and muscular hypertrophy.

AB  - Background: Knowledge and attitudes are among the key drivers of social
      behavioral change. We assessed employed health professionals' (HPs) knowledge,
      attitude, and practice regarding COVID-19 in Dessie city, northeast Ethiopia.
      Methods: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 419 HPs
      working at Dessie city from 17 to 21 May 2020. The data were collected using a
      self-administered structured questionnaire. Knowledge, attitude, and practice are
      measured using 19, 16, and 8 questions, respectively. Knowledge and attitude
      scores are dichotomized at the 3rd quartile, while practice is using the mean
      value. Data entry and analysis were conducted using EpiData Manager 4.2 and SPSS 
      25, respectively. Three independent logistic regression analyses were carried out
      to determine the associated factors. We defined significant association at a
      p-value of < 0.05. Results: Out of 419 participants, 369 (88.1%) have sufficient 
      knowledge regarding COVID-19 (95% CI: 85-91). The mean knowledge score is 16.8
      with a +/- 2.1 SD. Similarly, 355 (84.7%) of the HPs have a favorable attitude
      toward COVID-19 (95% CI: 81-87.9). The mean attitude score is 14 with +/- 2.1 SD.
      However, practice regarding COVID-19 is adequate only in 69.7% (292) of the HPs
      (95% CI: 65.2-94). The mean practice score is 5.1 with a +/- 1.3 SD. Sufficient
      knowledge is significantly associated with the type of health facility (AOR: 4.4,
      95% CI: 1.4-13.3), degree and above education (AOR: 2.6, 95% Cl: 1.4-4.9), radio 
      availability (AOR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3-4.7), and social media utilization (AOR: 2.3,
      95% CI: 1.1-5.1). The predictors of favorable attitude are training (AOR: 3.1,
      95% CI: 1.6-6.1), sufficient knowledge (AOR: 5.2, 95% Cl: 2.6-10.4), and type of 
      health facility (AOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-5.2). Conclusion: Most HPs have sufficient
      knowledge and a favorable attitude regarding COVID-19. However, practice is
      relatively low and there remains plenty to build assertive preventive behaviors. 
      The gap between knowledge and practice should be narrowed through an appropriate 
      social and behavioral change communication strategy.

AB  - Patient safety is a serious concern in the health care industry. To enhance
      patient safety, healthcare providers are expected to minimize accidental harm to 
      patients and enhance the quality of patient-centered care. The main objective of 
      this study is to explore the awareness of the patient safety culture among
      healthcare providers. It is further intended to assess key fields and factors
      that hinder patient safety adoption and determine the effects of demographic
      factors on healthcare providers' awareness of patient safety culture. This study 
      applied a cross-sectional quantitative design. It was conducted in a tertiary
      hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The participants consisted of all healthcare
      providers working in a specific tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia. A random
      sampling technique was applied in this study. The study sample size was 409
      participants. A valid and reliable questionnaire was used to collect the required
      data. The T-tests, ANOVA. And regression was used. The study found that there is 
      a moderate level of patient safety culture awareness among healthcare providers. 
      Moreover, the findings also revealed that the age group "31-40" showed
      statistically different awareness levels as compared to the "more than 50 years' 
      age group" (p = 0.012). Also, this study has found that gender and education have
      a significant influence on the awareness level of patient safety culture while
      position and work area have no influence on the awareness level of patient safety
      culture among healthcare providers. Managers in healthcare institutions should
      develop speeder response plans and make them part of the patient safety culture. 
      Institutions offering bachelor's degrees and postgraduate in nursing should pay
      more attention to the subject of patient safety. The government healthcare
      sector, together with the private healthcare sector, should continuously train
      healthcare providers on patient safety procedures to improve the patient safety
      culture. Healthcare providers should be encouraged to report errors made during
      diagnosis or treatments to avoid them in the future.

TI  - The Association Between Diabetic Retinopathy and the Prevalence of Age-Related
      Macular Degeneration-The Kailuan Eye Study.
PG  - 922289
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.922289 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic
      retinopathy (DR) and analyze whether DR is a risk factor for AMD. This
      population-based epidemiological study included 14,440 people from the Kailuan
      Eye Study in 2016, of whom 1,618 were patients with type 2 DM aged over 50 years,
      and 409 had DM with DR. We analyzed whether there were differences in the
      prevalence of AMD between DM with DR and DM without DR, and conducted a
      hierarchical statistical analysis according to different stages of DR. Using
      variable regression analysis, we explored whether DR constituted a risk factor
      for AMD. In the DM population, the prevalence of wet AMD in patients with DM with
      and without DR was 0. 3 and 0.2%, respectively, with no significant difference (P
      = 0.607). Meanwhile, the prevalence of dry AMD in patients with DM with and
      without DR was 20.8 and 16.0%, respectively, with a significant difference. In
      the subgroup analysis of dry AMD, the prevalence of early, middle, and late dry
      AMD in DM with DR was 14.4, 5.9, and 0.5%, respectively. In DM without DR, the
      prevalence of early, middle, and late dry AMD was 10.5, 4.8, and 0.7%,
      respectively (P = 0.031). In the subgroup analysis of DR staging, statistical
      analysis could not be performed because of the limited number of patients with
      PDR. In the variable regression analysis of risk factors for dry AMD, after
      adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, DR
      constituted the risk factor for dry AMD. In conclusion, DM did not constitute a
      risk factor for AMD, and the prevalence of wet AMD and dry AMD in patients with
      DM and DR was higher than that in patients with DM without DR (among which dry
      AMD was statistically significant). Multivariate regression analysis confirmed
      that DR is an independent risk factor for dry AMD. Reasonable control of DM and
      slowing down the occurrence and development of DR may effectively reduce the
      prevalence of AMD in patients with DM.

AB  - Background: In China, different classification of hospitals (COH) provide
      treatment for patients with different degrees of illness. COH play an important
      role in Chinese medical outcomes, but there is a lack of quantitative description
      of how much impact the results have. The objective of this study is to examine
      the correlation between COH on medical outcomes with the hope of providing
      insights into appropriate care and resource allocation. Methods: From the
      perspective of the COH framework, using the Urban Employee Basic Medical
      Insurance (UEBMI) data of Chengdu City from 2011 to 2015, with a sample size of
      512,658 hospitalized patients, this study used the nested multinomial logit model
      (NMNL) to estimate the impact of COH on the medical outcomes. Results: The
      patients were mainly elderly, with an average age of 66.28 years old. The average
      length of stay was 9.61 days. The female and male gender were split evenly. A
      high level of hospitals is positively and significantly associated with the death
      and transfer rates (p < 0.001), which may be related to more severe illness among
      patients in high COH. Conclusion: The COH made a difference in the medical
      outcomes significantly. COH should be reasonably selected according to disease
      types to achieve the optimal medical outcome. So, China should promote the
      construction of a tiered delivery system.

AB  - Objective: Early detection of scoliosis is of great significance to patients with
      scoliosis and the whole society. This paper aims to learn the prevalence of
      scoliosis screening positive among students in primary and secondary schools and 
      to explore the influencing factors. Methods: In 2019, a stratified cluster
      sampling technique was employed in this school-based cross-sectional study. The
      sampling covers all prefecture-level cities in Zhejiang Province. Based on the
      whole class, at least 80 students in each grade of primary school, junior high
      school, and senior high school were selected. Physical examination and scoliosis 
      screening were performed in the school-based investigation. The distribution of
      demographic characteristics and nutritional status of children and adolescents
      with scoliosis screening positive were explored. Results: A total of 45,547
      students were screened. The overall prevalence of children and adolescents with
      scoliosis screening positive were 3.9%. Higher prevalence of scoliosis screening 
      positive was found in students living in urban area (4.1%), women students
      (4.1%), students with low weight (5.3%) (p < 0.05), and the prevalence increased 
      with age (p < 0.05). In logistic analysis, we found age (OR = 1.145; 95% Cis:
      1.128, 1.162), gender (OR = 1.118; 95% Cis: 1.016, 1.230) and low weight (OR =
      1.48; 95% Cis: 1.25, 1.751) were the influencing factors for prevalence of
      scoliosis screening positive (p < 0.05). Conclusions: There were no disparities
      between living areas, but there was a significant difference between genders,
      among different ages, and among different nutritional statuses of children and
      adolescents with or without scoliosis screening positive. In multi-analysis, age,
      gender, and low weight were the influencing factors for the prevalence of
      scoliosis screening positive. Age and gender-specific scoliosis screening
      strategies and nutritional public health policies for children and adolescents
      are needed.

TI  - Successful Use of a 5G-Based Robot-Assisted Remote Ultrasound System in a Care
      Center for Disabled Patients in Rural China.
PG  - 915071
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.915071 [doi]
AB  - Background: Disability has become a global population health challenge. Due to
      difficulties in self-care or independent living, patients with disability mainly 
      live in community-based care centers or institutions for long-term care.
      Nonetheless, these settings often lack basic medical resources, such as
      ultrasonography. Thus, remote ultrasonic robot technology for clinical
      applications across wide regions is imperative. To date, few experiences of
      remote diagnostic systems in rural care centers have been reported. Objective: To
      assess the feasibility of a fifth-generation cellular technology (5G)-based
      robot-assisted remote ultrasound system in a care center for disabled patients in
      rural China. Methods: Patients underwent remote robot-assisted and bedside
      ultrasound examinations of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys. We
      compared the diagnostic consistency and differences between the two modalities
      and evaluated the examination duration, image quality, and safety. Results:
      Forty-nine patients were included (21 men; mean age: 61.0 +/- 19.0 [range: 19-91]
      years). Thirty-nine and ten had positive and negative results, respectively; 67
      lesions were detected. Comparing the methods, 41 and 8 patients had consistent
      and inconsistent diagnoses, respectively. The McNemar and kappa values were 0.727
      and 0.601, respectively. The mean duration of remote and bedside examinations was
      12.2 +/- 4.5 (range: 5-26) min and 7.5 +/- 1.8 (range: 5-13) min (p < 0.001),
      respectively. The median image score for original images on the patient side and 
      transmitted images on the doctor side was 5 points (interquartile range: [IQR]:
      4.7-5.0) and 4.7 points (IQR: 4.5-5.0) (p = 0.176), respectively. No obvious
      complications from the examination were reported. Conclusions: A 5G-based
      robot-assisted remote ultrasound system is feasible and has comparable diagnostic
      efficiency to traditional bedside ultrasound. This system may provide a unique
      solution for basic ultrasound diagnostic services in primary healthcare settings.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Study of Nalbuphine in Surgical Patients Undergoing General
      Anesthesia with Varying Degrees of Liver Dysfunction.
PG  - 2383-2393
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S371596 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of nalbuphine in
      patients undergoing general anesthesia with varying degrees of liver dysfunction.
      Patients and Methods: Twenty-four patients were enrolled and divided into three
      cohorts based on liver function: normal liver function (n = 13), mild liver
      dysfunction (n = 5), and moderate/severe liver dysfunction (n = 6). During the
      induction of anesthesia, they received 15 mg of nalbuphine intravenously. Venous 
      blood samples were collected from each patient. The plasma concentration of
      nalbuphine was determined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem
      mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic parameters of nalbuphine were
      calculated by non-compartmental analysis (NCA) using Phoenix WinNonlin software. 
      Results: Compared with the normal liver function group, the plasma elimination
      half-life (T1/2) of nalbuphine was increased by approximately 33% in the
      moderate/severe liver dysfunction group (2.66 h vs 3.54 h, P<0.05), and the
      volume of distribution (Vd) increased by approximately 85% (100.08 L vs 184.95 L,
      P<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that weight and platelet were associated 
      with clearance (CL); total bilirubin as an independent factor was associated with
      T1/2, and weight associated with area under the curve (AUC(0-->infinity))
      independently. Conclusion: The T1/2, mean residence time, and Vd of nalbuphine in
      patients with moderate/severe liver dysfunction were prolonged or increased
      significantly compared with those in the normal liver function group. These data 
      suggest that it may need to be used with caution when nalbuphine is administered 
      to patients with moderate or severe liver dysfunction.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the effective components and possible mechanism of action
      of Lavandula angustifolia Mill. essential oil (LEO) in preventing vomiting
      through the olfactory pathway. Materials and Methods: A new network
      pharmacology-based method was established to analyze main components and pathways
      of LEO involved in antiemetic effects by introducing component content;
      biological activities of key proteins of the olfactory pathway and their
      corresponding compounds were verified by molecular docking technique; and finally
      pica in a rat model was established to verify the molecular mechanism of
      antiemetic effects of LEO by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to
      determine the serum 5-HT, substance P, and DA levels in each group and by
      immunohistochemistry to determine the contents of 5-HT3R, CaMKII and ERK1/2
      proteins in the medulla oblongata tissue. Results: Network pharmacology combined 
      with molecular docking analysis showed that the mechanism of the antiemetic
      effect of LEO may be related to (2Z)-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienyl acetate, linalyl
      acetate, butanoic acid, hexyl ester, 4-hexen-1-ol, 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethenyl)-,
      acetate, .tau.-cadinol and other active ingredients, which regulate the cyclic
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway and the expression of BRAF, PDE 
      and other targets on the pathway. An ELISA revealed that LEO reduced the levels
      of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), substance P, and dopamine in serum compared with
      the model group (P <0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that LEO decreased
      the expression of 5-HT3R, CaMKII, and ERK1/2 proteins in the medulla oblongata of
      rats compared with the model group (P <0.01). Conclusion: LEO may achieve the
      antiemetic effect by reducing the content of 5-HT and inhibiting its related
      receptors, thereby regulating downstream Ca(2+)/CaMKII/ERK1/2 pathway of the cAMP
      signaling pathway.

      (HSA)-Gemcitabine (GEM)/Curcumin (CUR) nanoparticles (NPs) were characterized for
      physicochemical properties, stability and in vitro release. Comparisons of
      HSA-GEM/CUR NPs and RGD-HSA-GEM/CUR NPs regarding tissue distributions and
      pharmacodynamics were also carried out using mice as the animal models. Results: 
      Transmission electron micrographs showed that RGD peptide-conjugated HSA-NPs had 
      an irregular surface, good dispersion (PDI=0.139+/-0.03) and a uniform size
      distribution (Mean PS=115.6+/-5.7 nm). The zeta-potential was -17.3 mV. As
      regards in vitro release, non RGD modified NPs showed a faster release rate in 24
      hours, yielding a release amount of 75% for GEM and 72% for CUR. RGD-HSA-GEM/CUR 
      NPs exhibited 67% of accumulated release of GEM (63% for CUR) in 24 hours. This
      may be due to the HSA chain covering the surface of NPs, which hindered the drug 
      release. The cytotoxicity of GEM/CUR co-loaded NPs was significantly higher than 
      that of single-drug NPs (P < 0.05). In vivo study results indicated that
      RGD-HSA-GEM/CUR NPs had notable targeting effect on subcutaneous tumors, with a
      potential to actively deliver drugs to tumor tissues. Conclusion: In this study, 
      we prepared RGD-HSA-GEM/CUR NPs that had both good water solubility and
      tumor-targeting property. The results also showed that the RGD modified NPs had
      advantages in increasing GEM/CUR concentration at tumor sites and reducing its
      distribution in peripheral organs.

      achieved complete or partial response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or
      radiotherapy.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to determine the long-term survival of patients with 
      cT4 esophageal cancer (EC) and whether neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy
      plus surgery (nCRT/RT + S) is superior to definitive CRT(dCRT)/RT in terms of
      survival in cT4 EC downstaged after nCRT/RT. Summary background data: Treatment
      options for cT4 EC include dCRT/RT and nCRT/RT + S, but it is not clear whether
      the latter provides survival benefit in patients downstaged after nCRT/RT.
      Methods: From 2002 to 2017, 726 patients with cT4 esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma (ESCC) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients achieving clinical
      complete response (cCR) or partial response (PR) after 4-week RT (median dose,
      40.7 Gy) and considered fit for surgery were offered esophagectomy. Of the 726
      patients, 308 (42.4%) achieved cCR/PR, while 74 patients received subsequent
      surgery (nCRT/RT + S group), 234 patients received dCRT/RT. Results: Median
      follow-up was 58 months. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free
      survival (PFS) rates for all patients were 33.3% and 35.6%, respectively. The
      corresponding OS and PFS rates were 54.8% and 48.5% in the nCRT/RT + S group
      versus 30.0% and 22.1% in the dCRT/RT group (both p < 0.0001). After adjusting
      the confounding variables with inverse probability of treatment weighting, the
      adjusted 3-year OS rates were 50.4% in the nCRT/RT + S group versus 50.8% in the 
      dCRT/RT group (p = 0.15). However, the adjusted 3-year PFS rates were
      significantly different between the two groups (49.0% and versus 38.3%, p =
      0.004). Postoperative complications occurred in 18 (24.3%) patients. Conclusion: 
      The long-term survival of cT4 ESCC was improved after the use of
      three-dimensional CRT. In cT4, EC responded to nCRT/RT, surgery improves PFS but 
      not OS.

AB  - Background: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and understudied disease, 
      with 40% of cases presenting with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive subtype. The goals of this study were to (i) assess the
      pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of short-term neoadjuvant
      dual-HER2-blockade and paclitaxel, (ii) contrast baseline and on-treatment
      transcriptional profiles of IBC tumor biopsies associated with pCR, and (iii)
      identify biological pathways that may explain the effect of neoadjuvant therapy
      on tumor response. Patients and Methods: A single-arm phase II trial of
      neoadjuvant trastuzumab (H), pertuzumab (P), and paclitaxel for 16 weeks was
      completed among patients with newly diagnosed HER2-positive IBC. Fresh-frozen
      tumor biopsies were obtained pretreatment (D1) and 8 days later (D8), following a
      single dose of HP, prior to adding paclitaxel. We performed RNA-sequencing on D1 
      and D8 tumor biopsies, identified genes associated with pCR using differential
      gene expression analysis, identified pathways associated with pCR using gene set 
      enrichment and gene expression deconvolution methods, and compared the pCR
      predictive value of principal components derived from gene expression profiles by
      calculating and area under the curve for D1 and D8 subsets. Results: Twenty-three
      participants were enrolled, of whom 21 completed surgery following neoadjuvant
      therapy. Paired longitudinal fresh-frozen tumor samples (D1 and D8) were obtained
      from all patients. Among the 21 patients who underwent surgery, the pCR and the
      4-year disease-free survival were 48% (90% CI 0.29-0.67) and 90% (95% CI 66-97%),
      respectively. The transcriptional profile of D8 biopsies was found to be more
      predictive of pCR (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.7993-1) than the D1 biopsies (AUC =
      0.79, 95% CI: 0.5905-0.9822). Conclusions: In patients with HER2-positive IBC
      treated with neoadjuvant HP and paclitaxel for 16 weeks, gene expression patterns
      of tumor biopsies measured 1 week after treatment initiation not only offered
      different biological information but importantly served as a better predictor of 
      pCR than baseline transcriptional analysis. Trial Registration:

AB  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic has a high impact on the health of pregnant women
      and healthcare providers worldwide. Objective: This study aims to assess
      midwives' knowledge and preparedness in providing maternity care during COVID-19 
      pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical hospital-based study that
      included 116 midwives, who were working in labor ward, was conducted in the
      Dodoma region of Tanzania from March to June 2021. The Chi-square test and
      Fisher's exact test were used to assess the association between the categorical
      variables. The predictors of midwives' knowledge and preparedness were determined
      using binary logistic regression analysis. Statistical analysis was performed
      using SPSS version 23.0; p < .05 was considered to be significant. Results: Of
      the midwives studied, 63 (54.3%) had adequate knowledge about COVID-19 and only
      30 (25.9%) were adequately prepared on provision of maternal care. Having
      diploma/bachelor level of education (AOR = 2.62, 95%CI = 1.08-6.36, p = .033),
      being trained on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.65, 95%CI = 1.11-12.00, p = .033) and working 
      in urban health facilities (AOR = 3.65, 95%CI = 1.17-13.98, p = .002) were the
      significant determinants of midwives' knowledge on COVID-19. Working at a health 
      center (AOR = 0.19, 95%CI = 0.03-1.32. p = .033), being trained on COVID-19 (AOR 
      = 0.04, 95%CI = 0.01-0.14, p = .000 and having adequate knowledge on COVID-19
      (AOR = 0.20, 95%CI = 0.03-1.32, p = .032) were determinants of midwives'
      preparedness on provision of maternal care. Conclusion: Knowledge and
      preparedness in the provision of maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic were
      low. Emphasis should be put on training midwives on IPC when providing maternity 
      care. This may help in preventing the spread of infectious diseases including
      COVID-19 as we observed in the present study.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), induced by severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a multi-organ and multi-system disease
      with high morbidity and mortality in severe cases due to respiratory failure and 
      severe cardiovascular events. However, the various manifestations of neurological
      and psychiatric (N/P) systems of COVID-19 should not be neglected. Some clinical 
      studies have reported a high risk of N/P disorders in COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 
      patients and that their outcomes were positively associated with the disease
      severity. These clinical manifestations could attribute to direct SARS-CoV-2
      invasion into the central nervous system (CNS), which is often complicated by
      systemic hypoxia, the dysfunctional activity of the renin-angiotensin system and 
      other relevant pathological changes. These changes may remain long term and may
      even lead to persistent post-COVID consequences on the CNS, such as memory,
      attention and focus issues, persistent headaches, lingering loss of smell and
      taste, enduring muscle aches and chronic fatigue. Mild confusion and coma are
      serious adverse outcomes of neuropathological manifestations in COVID-19
      patients, which could be diversiform and vary at different stages of the clinical
      course. Although lab investigations and neuro-imaging findings may help quantify 
      the disease's risk, progress and prognosis, large-scale and persistent
      multicenter clinical cohort studies are needed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19
      on the N/P systems. However, we used "Boolean Operators" to search for relevant
      research articles, reviews and clinical trials from PubMed and the ClinicalTrials
      dataset for "COVID-19 sequelae of N/P systems during post-COVID periods" with the
      time frame from December 2019 to April 2022, only found 42 in 254,716
      COVID-19-related articles and 2 of 7931 clinical trials involved N/P sequelae
      during post-COVID periods. Due to the increasing number of infected cases and the
      incessant mutation characteristics of this virus, diagnostic and therapeutic
      guidelines for N/P manifestations should be further refined.

TI  - Towards mid-position based Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy using online
      magnetic resonance imaging guidance for central lung tumours.
PG  - 24-31
LID - 10.1016/j.phro.2022.05.002 [doi]
AB  - Background and purpose: Central lung tumours can be treated by magnetic resonance
      (MR)-guided radiotherapy. Complications might be reduced by decreasing the
      Planning Target Volume (PTV) using mid-position (midP)-based planning instead of 
      Internal Target Volume (ITV)-based planning. In this study, we aimed to verify a 
      method to automatically derive patient-specific PTV margins for midP-based
      planning, and show dosimetric robustness of midP-based planning for a 1.5T
      MR-linac. Materials and methods: Central(n = 12) and peripheral(n = 4) central
      lung tumour cases who received 8x7.5 Gy were included. A midP-image was
      reconstructed from ten phases of the 4D-Computed Tomography using deformable
      image registration. The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) was delineated on the midP-image
      and the PTV margin was automatically calculated based on van Herk's margin
      recipe, treating the standard deviation of all Deformation Vector Fields, within 
      the GTV, as random error component. Dosimetric robustness of midP-based planning 
      for MR-linac using automatically derived margins was verified by 4D
      dose-accumulation. MidP-based plans were compared to ITV-based plans.
      Automatically derived margins were verified with manually derived margins.
      Results: The mean D95% target coverage in GTV + 2 mm was 59.9 Gy and 62.0 Gy for 
      midP- and ITV-based central lung plans, respectively. The mean lung dose was
      significantly lower for midP-based treatment plans (difference:-0.3 Gy; p < 0.042
      ). Automatically derived margins agreed within one millimeter with manually
      derived margins. Conclusions: This retrospective study indicates that
      mid-position-based treatment plans for central lung Stereotactic Body Radiation
      Therapy yield lower OAR doses compared to ITV-based treatment plans on the
      MR-linac. Patient-specific GTV-to-PTV margins can be derived automatically and
      result in clinically acceptable target coverage.

      with Plasmodium berghei ANKA and Trichinella zimbabwensis.
PG  - e13713
LID - 10.7717/peerj.13713 [doi]
AB  - Background: Plasmodium falciparum and tissue dwelling helminth parasites are
      endemic in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The geographical overlap in co-infection is 
      a common phenomenon. However, there is continued paucity of information on how
      the co-infection influence the blood glucose and insulin profiles in the infected
      host. Animal models are ideal to elucidate effects of co-infection on disease
      outcomes and hence, blood glucose, insulin and glycogen profiles were assessed in
      Sprague-Dawley rats co-infected with P. berghei ANKA (Pb) and Trichinella
      zimbabwensis (Tz), a tissue-dwelling nematode. Methods:
      One-hundred-and-sixty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight range 90-150 g) were
      randomly divided into four separate experimental groups: Control (n = 42),
      Pb-infected (n = 42), Tz-infected (n = 42) and Pb- + Tz-infected group (n = 42). 
      Measurement of Pb parasitaemia was done daily throughout the experimental study
      period for the Pb and the Pb + Tz group. Blood glucose was recorded every third
      day in all experimental groups throughout the experimental study period. Liver
      and skeletal muscle samples were harvested, snap frozen for determination of
      glycogen concentration. Results: Results showed that Tz mono-infection and Tz +
      Pb co-infection did not have blood glucose lowering effect in the host as
      expected. This points to other possible mechanisms through which tissue-dwelling 
      parasites up-regulate the glucose store without decreasing the blood glucose
      concentration as exhibited by the absence of hypoglycaemia in Tz + Pb
      co-infection group. Hypoinsulinemia and an increase in liver glycogen content was
      observed in Tz mono-infection and Tz + Pb co-infection groups of which the
      triggering mechanism remains unclear. Conclusions: To get more insights into how 
      glucose, insulin and glycogen profiles are affected during plasmodium-helminths
      co-infections, further studies are recommended where other tissue-dwelling
      helminths such as Taenia taeniformis which has strobilocercus as the metacestode 
      in the liver to mimic infections such as hydatid disease in humans are used.

      Deserts of Northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
PG  - 952074
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.952074 [doi]
AB  - The mechanism governing plant community assembly across large-scale Gobi deserts 
      remains unclear. Here, we inferred the roles of different assembly processes in
      structuring plant communities in the Gobi deserts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by
      using a phylogenetic tree, and leaf and root traits. The functional and
      phylogenetic structures of 183 plant communities were assessed, and their
      distributions were linked with environmental gradients. Our results demonstrated 
      that functional convergence was prevalent in most functional traits (75% of the
      traits) and accentuated when all traits were combined. The phylogenetic structure
      exhibited significant divergence. We observed the contrasting response of
      functional and phylogenetic assembly structures to environmental gradients. More 
      importantly, we found that the shifts in the functional assembly along
      environmental gradients were trait-specific, with dominant roles of local
      factors, such as gravel coverage and soil attributes, in determining the
      distribution patterns of most traits. However, the distribution patterns of leaf 
      P concentration (LPC), root N concentration (RNC), and root P concentration (RPC)
      were mainly driven by climatic factors. These results reveal that niche-based
      processes, such as abiotic filtering and weaker competitive exclusion, are the
      major drivers of species co-occurrence, which results in the widespread
      coexistence of phylogenetically distinct but functionally similar species within 
      the Gobi plant community. Our findings could improve the understanding of plant
      community assembly processes and biodiversity maintenance in extremely harsh
      drylands.

      to Nickel Toxicity.
PG  - 950392
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.950392 [doi]
AB  - Globally, heavy metal pollution of soil has remained a problem for food security 
      and human health, having a significant impact on crop productivity. In
      agricultural environments, nickel (Ni) is becoming a hazardous element. The
      present study was performed to characterize the toxicity symptoms of Ni in pepper
      seedlings exposed to different concentrations of Ni. Four-week-old pepper
      seedlings were grown under hydroponic conditions using seven Ni concentrations
      (0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, and 100 mg L(-1) NiCl2. 6H2O). The Ni toxicity showed
      symptoms, such as chlorosis of young leaves. Excess Ni reduced growth and biomass
      production, root morphology, gas exchange elements, pigment molecules, and
      photosystem function. The growth tolerance index (GTI) was reduced by 88-, 75-,
      60-, 45-, 30-, and 19% in plants against 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, and 100 mg L(-1) Ni,
      respectively. Higher Ni concentrations enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity, ROS 
      accumulation, membrane integrity [malondialdehyde (MDA) and electrolyte leakage
      (EL)], and metabolites (proline, soluble sugars, total phenols, and flavonoids)
      in pepper leaves. Furthermore, increased Ni supply enhanced the Ni content in
      pepper's leaves and roots, but declined nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and
      phosphorus (P) levels dramatically. The translocation of Ni from root to shoot
      increased from 0.339 to 0.715 after being treated with 10-100 mg L(-1) Ni. The
      uptake of Ni in roots was reported to be higher than that in shoots. Generally,
      all Ni levels had a detrimental impact on enzyme activity and led to cell death
      in pepper seedlings. However, the present investigation revealed that Ni >/= 30
      mg L(-1) lead to a deleterious impact on pepper seedlings. In the future,
      research is needed to further explore the mechanism and gene expression involved 
      in cell death caused by Ni toxicity in pepper plants.

AB  - Soil salt-alkalization is a common yet critical environmental stress factor for
      plant growth and development. Discovering and exploiting genes associated with
      alkaline tolerance in maize (Zea mays L.) is helpful for improving alkaline
      resistance. Here, an association panel consisting of 200 maize lines was used to 
      identify the genetic loci responsible for alkaline tolerance-related traits in
      maize seedlings. A total of nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their
      associated candidate genes were found to be significantly associated with
      alkaline tolerance using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). An additional
      200 genes were identified when the screen was extended to include a linkage
      disequilibrium (LD) decay distance of r(2) >/= 0.2 from the SNPs. RNA-sequencing 
      (RNA-seq) analysis was then conducted to confirm the linkage between the
      candidate genes and alkali tolerance. From these data, a total of five
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs; |log2FC| >/= 0.585, p < 0.05) were verified
      as the hub genes involved in alkaline tolerance. Subsequently, two candidate
      genes, Zm00001d038250 and Zm00001d001960, were verified to affect the alkaline
      tolerance of maize seedlings by qRT-PCR analysis. These genes were putatively
      involved protein binding and "flavonoid biosynthesis process," respectively,
      based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO)
      enrichment analyses. Gene promoter region contains elements related to stress and
      metabolism. The results of this study will help further elucidate the mechanisms 
      of alkaline tolerance in maize, which will provide the groundwork for future
      breeding projects.

      Latarjet Treatment for Anterior Shoulder Instability.
PG  - 23259671221083967
LID - 10.1177/23259671221083967 [doi]
AB  - Background: Preoperative coracoid dimensions may affect the size of the bone
      graft transferred to the glenoid rim and thus the postoperative outcomes of
      Latarjet coracoid transfer. Purpose: To determine the effect of coracoid length
      and width as measured on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on
      outcomes after Latarjet treatment of anterior shoulder instability. Study Design:
      Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Included were patients who underwent
      primary Latarjet surgery between 2009 and 2019 and had preoperative MRI scans and
      minimum 2-year postoperative outcomes. Longitudinal coracoid length was measured 
      on axial MRI sequences as the distance from the coracoclavicular ligament
      insertion to the distal tip. Comparisons were made between shorter and longer
      coracoids and between narrower and wider coracoids. The outcomes of interest were
      recurrent instability, reoperation, complications, return to sport (RTS), and
      American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. Independent-samples t test,
      Mann-Whitney test, chi-square test, and Fisher exact test were used to compare
      outcomes between groups, and univariate correlation coefficients were calculated 
      to evaluate the relationships between demographics and coracoid dimensions.
      Results: Overall, 56 patients were included (mean age, 28.4 years). The mean +/- 
      SD coracoid length was 21.6 +/- 2.4 mm and width 10.0 +/- 1.0 mm. Relative to
      patients with a longer coracoid (>/=22 mm; n = 26), patients with a shorter
      coracoid (<22 mm; n = 30) had similar rates of recurrent instability (shorter vs 
      longer; 6.7% vs 3.8%), complications (10.0% vs 15.4%), reoperation (3.3% vs
      7.7%), and RTS (76.5% vs 58.8%) and similar postoperative ASES scores (85.0 vs
      81.6) (P >/= .05 for all). Likewise, relative to patients with a wider coracoid
      (>/=10 mm; n = 27), patients with a narrower coracoid (<10 mm; n = 29) had
      similar prevalences of recurrent instability (narrower vs wider; 6.9% vs 3.7%),
      complications (17.2% vs 7.4%), reoperation (3.5% vs 7.4%), and RTS (66.7% vs
      68.4%) and similar postoperative ASES scores (87.1 vs 80.0) (P >/= .05 for all). 
      Conclusion: Patients undergoing Latarjet coracoid transfer had similar
      postoperative outcomes regardless of preoperative coracoid dimensions. These
      findings should be confirmed in a larger cohort before further clinical
      recommendations are made.

TI  - The Examination of the Influence of Caffeinated Coffee Consumption on the

      Oxidative-Antioxidant Balance in Young Adults: A Preliminary Report.
PG  - 1735204
LID - 10.1155/2022/1735204 [doi]
AB  - We verified whether caffeinated coffee consumption influenced the concentrations 
      of prolactin (PRL) and oxidative stress parameters: total antioxidant status
      (TAS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), total oxidant status (TOS),
      oxidative stress index (OSI), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), uric
      acid (UA), total bilirubin (T-Bil), albumin (ALB), iron (Fe), calcium (Ca),
      magnesium (Mg), and inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP)-in blood sera
      obtained at 15, 60, and 120 minutes after caffeinated coffee intake, in relation 
      to the fasting point. The study participants were 33 young, healthy, nonsmoking
      volunteers (15 men, 18 women) aged 19-29 years. PRL concentrations significantly 
      decreased (p < 0.05) after consumption, except at time point 15' in men (p >
      0.05). In women, FRAP levels significantly increased over time, and significant
      changes were also observed for UA at 120' and ALB at 15'. In men, significant
      changes were found for levels of AOPP at 15', T-Bil and ALB at 15', iron at 60'
      and 120', and calcium at 120'. There were no significant differences in the
      levels of other examined parameters between the defined time points. In
      conclusion, the substances contained in caffeinated coffee decrease the level of 
      prolactin and may also have an impact on selected parameters of oxidative stress,
      which could be the basis of future research focused on the identification of new 
      therapeutic targets.

PG  - 8230214
LID - 10.1155/2022/8230214 [doi]
AB  - Mediastinal cancer radiotherapy exposes the heart and causes myocardial injury.
      It is of utmost importance to identify effective prevention and treatment
      targets. In this study, the regulatory role of adropin (Ad) in radiation-induced 
      myocardial injury (RIMI) was explored in mice. After C57BL/6 mice were
      administered E0771 cells and received radiotherapy, the effects of exogenous Ad
      intervention on myocardial fibrosis, apoptosis, microvessel density, oxidative
      stress, and protein expression levels were observed. The results showed that
      exogenous Ad effectively improved cardiac function, suppressed oxidative stress, 
      inhibited myocardial fibrosis, reduced myocardial apoptosis, and promoted
      microangiogenesis in RIMI mice. Ad also downregulated the expression levels of
      transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), and cleaved
      caspase 3 and upregulated the expression of phosphor-endothelial nitric oxide
      synthase (p-eNOS). However, the above-mentioned effects of Ad were significantly 
      reversed in Ad(-/-) mice. Radiotherapy resulted in the downregulation of
      phosphor-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (p-VEGFR2) and p-Akt in
      myocardial tissue, which were upregulated by Ad. However, after targeted
      inhibition of VEGFR2 with apatinib, the effect of Ad on improving RIMI was
      significantly reversed. Taken together, exogenous Ad significantly ameliorated
      RIMI by reducing oxidative stress, promoting microangiogenesis, and inhibiting
      myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis. The underlying molecular mechanism involved
      may be elucidated by activation of the VEGFR2/PI3K/Akt pathway.

      injury. Premature activation of muscle satellite cells (SCs), induced by
      isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) before injury, accelerates myogenic regeneration,
      disrupts NMJ remodeling and maturation, decreases Sema3A protein-induced
      neuro-repulsion, and is accompanied by time-dependent changes in S100B protein
      levels. Here, to study the effects of premature SC activation on TSCs and SCs,
      both expressing P75 nerve growth-factor receptor, in situ hybridization was used 
      to identify transcripts of S100B and Sema3A, and the number, intensity, and
      diameter of expression sites were analyzed. The number of sites/fields expressing
      S100B and Sema3A increased with regeneration time (both p < 0.001).
      Expression-site intensity (S100B) and diameter (S100B and Sema3A) decreased
      during regeneration (p = 0.005; p < 0.05, p = 0.006, respectively). P75 protein
      colocalized with a subset of S100B and Sema3A expression sites. Principal
      component analyses of gene expression, protein levels, and histological variables
      (fiber diameter, vascular density) in control and ISDN-pretreated groups
      explained 83% and 64% of the dataset variance, respectively. A very strong
      loading coefficient for colocalization of P75 protein with S100B and Sema3A mRNAs
      (0.91) in control regenerating muscle dropped markedly during regeneration
      disrupted by premature SC activation (-0.10 in Factor 1 to 0.55 in Factor 3).
      These findings strongly implicate the triple-expression profile by TSCs and/or
      SCs as a strong correlate of the important synchrony of muscle and nerve
      regeneration after muscle tissue injury. The results have the potential to focus 
      future research on the complex interplay of TSCs and SCs in neuromuscular tissue 
      repair and help promote effective function after traumatic muscle injury.

AB  - Introduction: Frame-based stereotactic biopsy is well-established to play an
      essential role in neurosurgery. In recent years, different robotic devices have
      been introduced in neurosurgery centers. This study aimed to compare the SINO
      surgical robot-assisted frameless brain biopsy with standard frame-based
      stereotactic biopsy in terms of efficacy, accuracy and complications. Methods: A 
      retrospective analysis was performed on 151 consecutive patients who underwent
      stereotactic biopsy at Chongqing Sanbo Jiangling Hospital between August 2017 and
      December 2021. All patients were divided into the frame-based group (n = 47) and 
      the SINO surgical robot-assisted group (n = 104). The data collected included
      clinical characteristics, diagnostic yield, operation times, accuracy, and
      postoperative complications. Results: There was no significant difference in
      diagnostic yield between the frame-based group and the SINO surgical
      robot-assisted group (95.74 vs. 98.08%, p > 0.05). The mean operation time in the
      SINO surgical robot-assisted group was significantly shorter than in the
      frame-based group (29.36 +/- 13.64 vs. 50.57 +/- 41.08 min). The entry point
      error in the frame-based group was significantly higher than in the
      robot-assisted group [1.33 +/- 0.40 mm (0.47-2.30) vs. 0.92 +/- 0.27 mm
      (0.35-1.65), P < 0.001]. The target point error in the frame-based group was also
      significantly higher than in the robot-assisted group [1.63 +/- 0.41 mm
      (0.74-2.65) vs. 1.10 +/- 0.30 mm (0.69-2.03), P < 0.001]. Finally, there was no
      significant difference in postoperative complications between the two groups.
      Conclusion: Robot-assisted brain biopsy becomes an increasingly mainstream tool
      in the neurosurgical procedure. The SINO surgical robot-assisted platform is as
      efficient, accurate and safe as standard frame-based stereotactic biopsy and
      provides a reasonable alternative to stereotactic biopsy in neurosurgery.

LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.938740 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to determine the underlying pathogenesis of
      Meniere's disease (MD) using transcriptome analysis. Methods: Total RNA was
      extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 39 patients with MD and 
      39 controls. Through microarray analysis for nine patients and controls, the
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of those two groups were screened based on 
      cut-off criteria (|fold changes| > 2.0 and adjusted p-value < 0.05). The
      functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed using Gene Ontology (GO).
      Results: There were 996 DEGs identified in the MD group: 415 were upregulated and
      581 were downregulated. A functional enrichment analysis indicated that the
      downregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in terms related to immune system 
      processes. Among them, 17 genes were enriched in terms for the major
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein complex, and the relative messenger RNA 
      (mRNA) levels of three markedly downregulated DEGs [fold changes < -5: human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DMA, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DPB1] were significantly decreased
      in another 30 patients with MD compared with normal controls by quantitative
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). However, there were no
      correlations between the expression levels of these three genes and clinical
      data, such as age, onset age, time course, or hearing threshold. Conclusions: Our
      transcriptome analysis showed that the downregulated DEGs in MD were mainly
      associated with the immune system pathways including the MHC protein complex in
      MD. Remarkably, a breakdown in immunological tolerance mediated by MHC class II
      may contribute to the MD development, which has implications for targeted
      treatment.

AB  - Objectives: We aimed to investigate the association between post-procedure
      cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and severity of brain edema in patients with 
      acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who received early endovascular therapy (EVT).
      Methods: We retrospectively included patients with AIS who received EVT within 24
      h of onset between February 2016 and November 2021. Post-procedure CBFV of the
      middle cerebral artery was measured in the affected and the contralateral
      hemispheres using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. The severity of brain edema
      was measured using the three-level cerebral edema grading from the Safe
      Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study, with grades 2-3
      indicating severe brain edema. The Association between CBFV parameters and
      severity of brain edema was analyzed. Results: A total of 101 patients (mean age 
      64.2 years, 65.3% male) were included, of whom 56.3% (57/101) suffered brain
      edema [grade 1, 23 (22.8%); grade 2, 10 (9.9%); and grade 3, 24 (23.8%)].
      Compared to patients with non-severe brain edema, patients with severe brain
      edema had lower affected/contralateral ratios of systolic CBFV (median 1 vs. 1.2,
      P = 0.020) and mean CBFV (median 0.9 vs. 1.3, P = 0.029). Multivariate logistic
      regression showed that severe brain edema was independently associated with
      affected/contralateral ratios of systolic CBFV [odds ratio (OR) = 0.289, 95%
      confidence interval (CI): 0.069-0.861, P = 0.028] and mean CBFV (OR = 0.278, 95% 
      CI: 0.084-0.914, P = 0.035) after adjusting for potential confounders.
      Conclusion: Post-procedure affected/contralateral ratio of CBFV may be a
      promising predictor of brain edema severity in patients with AIS who received
      early EVT.

PG  - 932883
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.932883 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a rare autosomal dominant
      multisystemic disease with highly variable clinical presentation. Several case
      reports and one cohort study suggested a significant association between DM2 and 
      autoimmune diseases (AIDs). Aim: The aim of this study is to analyze the
      frequency and type of AIDs in patients with DM2 from the Serbian DM registry.
      Patients and Methods: A total of 131 patients with DM2 from 108 families were
      included, [62.6% women, mean age at DM2 onset 40.4 (with standard deviation 13)
      years, age at entering the registry 52 (12.8) years, and age at analysis 58.4
      (12.8) years]. Data were obtained from Akhenaten, the Serbian registry for DM,
      and through the hospital electronic data system. Results: Upon entering the
      registry, 35 (26.7%) of the 131 patients with DM2 had AIDs including Hashimoto
      thyroiditis (18.1%), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, systemic
      lupus, Sjogren's disease, localized scleroderma, psoriasis, celiac disease,
      Graves's disease, neuromyelitis optica, myasthenia gravis, and Guillain-Barre
      syndrome. At the time of data analysis, one additional patient developed new
      AIDs, so eventually, 36 (28.8%) of 125 DM2 survivors had AIDs. Antinuclear
      antibodies (ANAs) were found in 14 (10.7%) of 63 tested patients, including 12
      without defined corresponding AID (all in low titers, 1:40 to 1:160).
      Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) were negative in all 50 tested
      cases. The percentage of women was significantly higher among patients with AIDs 
      (82.9% vs. 55.2%, p <0.01). Conclusion: AIDs were present in as high as 30% of
      the patients with DM2. Thus, screening for AIDs in DM2 seems reasonable. Presence
      of AIDs and/or ANAs may lead to under-diagnosis of DM2.

TI  - Citicoline Treatment in Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Randomized, Single-Blind TMS
      Study.

AB  - Background: Recent research on animal models of ischemic stroke supports the idea
      that pharmacological treatment potentially enhancing intrinsic brain plasticity
      could modulate acute brain damage, with improved functional recovery. One of
      these new drugs is citicoline, which could provide neurovascular protection and
      repair effects. Objectives: The objective of this randomized, single-blind
      experimental study was to evaluate whether the treatment with Rischiaril((R))
      Forte was able to restore intracortical excitability measures, evaluated through 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols, in patients with acute
      ischemic stroke. Methods: Patients with acute ischemic stroke were recruited and 
      assigned to an eight-week therapy of standard treatment (control group - CG) or
      CDP-choline (Rischiaril((R)) Forte, containing 1,000 mg of citicoline sodium
      salt) added to conventional treatment (treatment group - TG). Each subject
      underwent a clinical evaluation and neurophysiological assessment using TMS,
      pretretament and posttreatment. Results: A total of thirty participants (mean
      [SD] age, 68.1 [9.6] years; 11 women [37%]) completed the study. We did not
      observe significant changes in clinical scores after CDP-choline treatment (all p
      > 0.05), but we observed a significant improvement in short-interval
      intracortical inhibition (SAI) (p = 0.003) in the TG group compared to the CG
      group. Conclusions: The eight-week treatment with citicoline after acute ischemic
      stroke may restore intracortical excitability measures, which partially depends
      on cholinergic transmission. This study extends current knowledge of the
      application of citicoline in acute ischemic stroke.

TI  - Responses of Combined Non-starch Polysaccharide Enzymes and Protease on Growth
      Performance, Meat Quality, and Nutrient Digestibility of Yellow-Feathered
      Broilers Fed With Diets With Different Crude Protein Levels.
PG  - 946204
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.946204 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the responses of non-starch
      polysaccharide (NSP) enzymes and protease combination on growth performance, meat
      quality, and nutrients digestibility of yellow-feathered broilers fed with
      corn-soybean meal basal diets with normal and subnormal crude protein (CP)
      levels. The experimental design was completely randomized with a 2 x 2 factorial 
      arrangement of treatments, including six replicates of 20 birds per pen. Two
      basal diets were formulated with normal CP level as positive control (PC) and
      subnormal CP level without extra essential amino acid (AA) supplementation as
      negative control (NC). The basal diets were supplemented without or with NSP
      enzymes and protease. Broilers fed with the NC diet had lower (P < 0.05) final
      body weight (BW), average daily weight gain (ADG) on days 1-21, 22-56 and 1-56
      and higher (P < 0.05) feed-to-gain ratio (F/G) on day 22-56 than those fed with
      PC diet. The broilers fed with the NC diet had higher (P < 0.05) L(*) and b(*)
      values in thigh muscle, crypt depth in the duodenum, and dry matter (DM)
      digestibility as well as lower (P < 0.05) villus height, musculature thicknesses,
      and villus height: crypt depth in the duodenum than those fed with the PC diet.
      Dietary NSP enzymes and protease combination increased (P < 0.05) the ADG and F/G
      of the broilers on days 1-56, and pH values in breast and thigh muscles as well
      as the digestibility of DM, gross energy (GE), CP and most AAs of the broilers on
      day 56. Compared with the PC diet, the combination of NSP enzymes and protease
      exhibited greater (P < 0.05) improvements in the digestibility of DM, CP, and
      some AAs (Asp, Ile, and Leu) in the broilers fed with the NC diet. In conclusion,
      reducing CP diet without essential AA supplementation impaired the growth
      performance and meat color of the thigh muscles of the broilers. The combination 
      of NSP enzymes and protease effectively improved the growth performance, meat
      quality, and nutritional values of the broilers. In terms of the digestibility of
      DM, CP, and some AAs, the magnitude of response to the addition of NSP enzymes
      and protease was greater in the low nutritional-quality diet with a subnormal CP 
      level.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to determine the optimum dietary metabolic
      energy (ME) and crude protein (CP) levels of growing male mink. One hundred
      forty-four healthy male minks at 75 days were randomly allocated into the six
      groups with 24 replicates, which was one mink for each replicate. The mink were
      fed six experimental diets with two CP levels (31.59 and 35.63%) and three ME
      levels (14.17, 15.96, and 17.73 MJ/kg) for a 7-day preliminary period and then
      for an 88-day experimental period. The final body weight (BW), average daily gain
      (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), fat digestibility, energy intake, the
      concentration of glucose (GLU), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of the mink
      were significantly increased by the CP or ME levels (P < 0.05). In addition, CP
      levels significantly (P < 0.01) increased the N intake and N retention. Dietary
      ME levels increased the utilization of gross energy. Obviously, there were
      significant CP x ME interactions for the final BW, ADG, fat digestibility, energy
      utilization, GLU, LDL (P < 0.01), and triglyceride contents (P < 0.05).
      Therefore, the optimum CP and ME levels were 35.97% and 18.18 MJ/kg, which can
      improve growth, enhance nutrient digestion, and promote blood lipid metabolism in
      growing mink.

TI  - Prevalence and Regulation of Dyslipidemia Among Adults With Type 2 Diabetes From 
      Three Primary Health Care Centers in Riyadh.
PG  - e27573
LID - 10.7759/cureus.27573 [doi]
AB  - Background Dyslipidemia is an added risk factor in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      who are more prone to develop cardiovascular diseases as it implies an alteration
      of the lipid level leading to serious health complications. Objective This study 
      aimed at assessing the prevalence of dyslipidemia among patients with type 2
      diabetes and comparing the lipid profile measurements between controlled and
      uncontrolled type 2 diabetic patients. Method A cross-sectional retrospective
      study was performed in three primary health care centers in Saudi Arabia. A
      sample of 418 patients with type 2 diabetes was enrolled in this study. To
      collect data, the researcher used a structured questionnaire and retrieved
      patients' data from the electronic medical records in the study setting. Results 
      The findings of the study showed that 82.1% of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)
      patients recruited in this study were dyslipidemic. In addition, it was found
      that there was a significant difference in triglycerides, fasting blood sugar
      (FBS), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) between controlled and uncontrolled
      diabetic patients (p</=0.05). Moreover, a significant interaction was found
      between gender, HbA1c control, educational level, and frequency of exercising on 
      one hand and dyslipidemia on the other hand (p</=0.05). Conclusion The study
      concluded that there is a high prevalence of dyslipidemia among type 2 diabetic
      patients in Saudi Arabia and a significant interaction between dyslipidemia and
      diabetic patients' gender, HbA1c control, educational level, and frequency of
      exercising. The study recommends increasing type 2 diabetic patients' awareness
      regarding the management of diabetes and dyslipidemia and the importance of
      providing educational intervention regarding diabetes self-care activities.

TI  - Effects of COVID-19 on Geographical Trends in the Orthopaedic Surgery Residency
      Match.
LID - e21.00107 [pii]
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.OA.21.00107 [doi]
AB  - Historically, medical students often match within the same geographic location or
      to an orthopaedic surgery residency program affiliated with their medical school.
      The objective of this investigation was to determine differences in geographic
      trends between orthopaedic residents matching before and during the
      Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This study analyzed 2 groups of
      orthopaedic residents: Pre-COVID cohort (years 2016-2020) and COVID-impacted
      cohort (year 2021). A list of accredited orthopaedic surgery residency programs
      (n = 202) was obtained. Orthopaedic residency program webpages were located
      (region [n = 4], division [n = 9], state [n = 50]). For each resident, their
      medical school and year of postgraduate training were recorded. Year 2021
      resident information was obtained from the orthopaedic residency program
      webpages, social media accounts, and medical school match lists. Residency
      programs affiliated with a medical school were also assigned. Descriptive
      statistics were performed. Two sample Student t tests with Bonferroni correction 
      applied to p-values (alpha < 0.05 significant) were performed. RESULTS: There
      were 4,832 residents analyzed (4,074 in Pre-COVID cohort; 758 in COVID-impacted
      cohort [758/868 of all positions in 2021 Match]). Statistically significant
      differences were detected between the COVID-impacted cohort (39.6%, p < 0.001)
      matching in the same state as their medical school (Pre-COVID 33.1%) and the
      COVID-impacted cohort (28.0%, p < 0.001) matching to a residency program
      affiliated with their medical school (Pre-COVID 21.2%). In the COVID-impacted
      cohort, students who matched in state matched to their home program more
      frequently (69.3%) compared with the Pre-COVID cohort (60.5%). Geographically,
      there was a difference in the COVID-impacted cohort (52.5%, p < 0.011) matching
      in the same division (Pre-COVID 47.5%). No statistically significant differences 
      were identified for residents matching to the same region as their medical school
      (Pre-COVID 60.1%; COVID-impacted 61%, p = 0.968). CONCLUSION: Residents matching 
      in the same state, in the same division, and to a residency program affiliated
      with their medical school increased significantly in the COVID-impacted cohort.
      There was no difference between cohorts matching in the same region as their
      medical school. Level of Evidence: Observational/Cross-Sectional.

TI  - Management of Ascites Following Deceased Donor Liver Transplantation: A Case
      Series.
PG  - e1350
LID - 10.1097/TXD.0000000000001350 [doi]
AB  - Background: Persistent ascites after orthotropic liver transplantation has
      numerous causes and can be challenging to manage. This study aimed to determine
      the outcomes associated with conservative and endovascular intervention of
      posttransplant ascites after deceased donor liver transplantation. Methods: Adult
      (>/=18 y) liver transplant recipients (between 2006 and 2019) who underwent
      hepatic venous pressure studies to investigate posttransplant ascites were
      included in this retrospective study. Comparisons were made between those who
      were managed with conservative therapy versus endovascular intervention and were 
      also based on hepatic venous wedge pressure gradient (normal [</=10 mm Hg] versus
      elevated [>10 mm Hg]). Results: A total of 30 patients underwent hepatic
      venography to investigate ascites during the study period. The median time from
      transplant to venography was 70 d. At least 1 endovascular intervention was
      performed in 18 of 30 patients (62%), and 12 of 30 patients (38%) were managed
      conservatively. Endovascular interventions included angioplasty (n = 4), hepatic 
      vein stenting (n = 9), or a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (n =
      7). The mean (range) hepatic venous wedge pressure gradient for the conservative 
      and endovascular intervention groups was 12 mm Hg (3-23) and14 mm Hg (2-35),
      respectively. At a 6-mo follow-up, ascites resolved in 6 of 12 patients (50%) and
      11 of 18 patients (61%) in the medical management and endovascular groups,
      respectively. The graft survival rates at 6 and 12 mo were (7/12 [58%] versus
      17/18 [94%], P = 0.02) and (7/12 [58%] versus 14/18 [78%], P = 0.25),
      respectively. Conclusions: Despite medical or endovascular intervention,
      resolution of ascites is achieved in <60% of patients with persistent ascites.
      Biopsy findings and venographic pressure studies should be carefully integrated
      into the management of posttransplant ascites.

AB  - Understanding modification of synthetic polymer structures is necessary for their
      accurate synthesis and potential applications. In this contribution, a series of 
      partially hydrolyzed poly(2-oxazoline) species were produced forming
      poly[(2-polyoxazoline)-co-(ethylenimine)] (P(EtOx-co-EI)) copolymers; EI being
      the hydrolyzed product of Ox. Bulk mass spectrometry (MS) measurements accurately
      measured the EI content. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the EI content in
      the copolymer samples determined the distribution of each monomer within the
      copolymer and corresponded to a theoretically modelled random distribution. The
      EI distribution across the polymers was shown to be effected by the choice of
      terminus, with a permanent hydrolysis event observed at an OH terminus. A
      neighbouring group effect wasn't observed at the polymer length analysed
      (approximately 25-mer species), suggesting that previously observed neighbouring 
      group effects require a larger polymer chain. Although clearly useful for random 
      polymer distribution this approach may be applied to many systems containing
      non-specific modifications to determine if they are directed or random locations 
      across peptides, proteins, polymers, and nucleic acids.

TI  - The Relationship Between Porphyromonas Gingivalis and Rheumatoid Arthritis: A
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 956417
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.956417 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systematical autoimmune disease, characterized by 
      chronic synovial joint inflammation and hurt. Porphyromonas gingivalis(P.
      gingivalis) can cause life-threatening inflammatory immune responses in humans
      when the host pathogenic clearance machinery is disordered. Some epidemiological 
      studies have reported that P. gingivalis exposure would increase the prevalence
      of RA. However, the results remain inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analysis was
      done to systematically analyze the relationship between P. gingivalis exposure
      and the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis. Database including Cochrane Library, 
      Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE were searched for published epidemiological
      articles assessed the relationship between P. gingivalis and RA. Obtained studies
      were screened based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
      overall Odds Ratios (ORs) of incorporated articles were pooled by random-effect
      model with STATA 15.1 software. The literature search returned a total of 2057
      studies. After exclusion, 28 articles were included and analyzed. The pooled ORs 
      showed a significant increase in the risk of RA in individuals with P. gingivalis
      exposure (OR = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.43-2.43). Subgroup analysis revealed that pooled
      ORs from populations located in Europe (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.46-3.22) and North
      America (OR = 2.50; 95% CI: 1.23-5.08) were significantly higher than that from
      population in Asia (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.20). Substantial heterogeneity was 
      observed but did not significantly influence the overall outcome. In conclusion, 
      our results indicated P. gingivalis exposure was a risk factor in RA. Prompt
      diagnosis and management decisions on P. gingivalis antimicrobial therapy would
      prevent rheumatoid arthritis development and progression.

      (2000-2018).
PG  - 921948

AB  - Background: The epidemiology and outcomes of biliary atresia (BA) have been
      well-documented in national cohorts from two main ethnicities, namely, the Asian 
      Orientals and Caucasians, with incidence ranging from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 9,000
      live births in East Asia and 1 in 15,000 to 19,000 live births in Europe and
      North America. Objective: We report the first nationwide BA study outside North
      America, Europe, and East Asia to describe the epidemiology and outcomes of BA in
      Saudi Arabia. Methods: A national database of BA cases diagnosed between 2000 and
      2018 was analyzed. We assessed clearance of jaundice (bilirubin <20 mumol/L) in
      all cases that underwent Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE). We then estimated survival
      using the Kaplan-Meier method with endpoints of liver transplantation (LT),
      death, or survival with native liver (SNL). Results: BA was diagnosed in 204
      infants (106 females; 10% pre-term). The incidence of BA was 1 in 44,365, or
      2.254 in 100,000 live births (range, 0.5-4 in 100,000). Polysplenia was diagnosed
      in 22 cases (11%). The median age at referral was 65 days. A total of 146
      children (71.5%) underwent KPE at a median age of 70 days. Clearance of jaundice 
      was achieved in 66 of the 146 (45%) infants. The 10-year SNL after KPE was 25.5%,
      and the overall 10-year estimated survival was 72.5%. The Kaplan-Meier survival
      curves for patients undergoing KPE at the age of <60, 61-90, and >90 days showed 
      a SNL rate at 51.6, 33, and 12.5%, respectively, at 5 years (P < 0.001). The 2-, 
      5-, and 10-year post-LT survival rates were 92.5, 90.6, and 90%, respectively.
      Undergoing an initial KPE did not impact negatively on the overall LT survival
      rate when compared to BA cases that underwent primary LT (P = 0.88). Conclusion: 
      The incidence rate of BA in Saudi Arabia is lower than the incidence reported
      elsewhere. Late referral of BA cases remains a problem in Saudi Arabia; as a
      result, the SNL rate was lower than reported by other national registries. Hence,
      national policies devoted to timely referral and earlier age at KPE are needed.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the distribution of pediatric keratoconus patients and the
      disease severity based on different age and gender groups in China. Materials and
      methods: A total of 446 keratoconus eyes in 266 pediatric patients from January
      2019 to January 2022 were included in the cross-sectional study. The clinical
      findings and severity of keratoconus were recorded and Kruskal-Wallis test,
      chi-squared test, and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test were used to compare the
      parameters between different gender and age groups. Results: The male/female
      ratio was 353/93 (3.8:1), and the median age was 16 years (range: 6-17 years).
      Male patients were statistically younger than female patients (P = 0.041). The
      male/female ratio decreased with age (P for trend = 0.011). The distribution of
      the topographic keratoconus classification (TKC) stage was significantly
      different between gender and age groups (all P < 0.05). Male patients had a
      higher ratio of advanced keratoconus eyes (TKC >/= 3) than female patients (P <
      0.001), and CMH analysis indicated that being a male was a risk factor for
      advanced keratoconus after controlling for age (odds ratio: 2.581, P < 0.001).
      Conclusion: Male keratoconus patients were younger, with a higher ratio of
      advanced keratoconus than female patients in the Chinese pediatric patients
      evaluated. Multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are necessary in the
      future.

AB  - Background: Children and adolescents seem to be less affected by the severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease in terms of severity,
      especially until the increasing spread of the omicron variant in December 2021.
      Anatomical structures and lower number of exhaled aerosols may in part explain
      this phenomenon. In a cohort of healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected children, we
      compared exhaled particle counts to gain further insights about the spreading of 
      SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods: In this single-center prospective
      observational trial, a total of 162 children and adolescents (age 6-17 years), of
      whom 39 were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 123
      PCR-negative, were included. The 39 PCR-positive children were compared to 39
      PCR-negative age-matched controls. The data of all PCR-negative children were
      analyzed to determine baseline exhaled particle counts in children. In addition, 
      medical and clinical history was obtained and spirometry was measured. Results:
      Baseline exhaled particle counts were low in healthy children. Exhaled particle
      counts were significantly increased in SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive children (median
      355.0/L; range 81-6955/L), compared to age-matched -negative children (median
      157.0/L; range 1-533/L; p < 0.001). Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive children 
      exhaled significantly higher levels of aerosols than healthy children. Overall
      children had low levels of exhaled particle counts, possibly indicating that
      children are not the major driver of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Trial Registration:

      Asthma and Allergic Conjunctivitis Among Egyptian Patients.
PG  - 971-982
LID - 10.2147/JAA.S373098 [doi]
AB  - Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interleukin 13 (IL13)
      gene are associated with vulnerability to allergic diseases, such as asthma and
      allergic conjunctivitis (AC). Periostin, as an IL13-induced protein, has emerged 
      as a novel biomarker in several allergic diseases. Data among Egyptian patients
      are still scarce. Aim: To find out the association of IL13 rs20541 gene
      polymorphism and serum levels of periostin with asthma and AC among Egyptian
      patients. Patients and Methods: Eighty-one Egyptian allergic patients with
      asthma, AC, and both asthma and AC (27 each), were enrolled in this case-control 
      study. Twenty-seven age and gender-matched healthy volunteers served as controls.
      All participants were tested for IL13 rs20541 SNP by real-time polymerase chain
      reaction, TaqMan method. Serum levels of periostin and IL13 were assessed by
      ELISA. Results: Compared to healthy subjects, asthmatic patients had a higher
      frequency of the homozygous adenine/adenine (AA) genotype at IL13 rs20541 SNP
      (14.8% vs 3.7%) and a lower frequency of the guanosine/guanosine (GG) genotype
      (51.9% vs 55.6%), while AC patients had higher GG genotype (70.4% vs 55.6%) with 
      no AA genotype detected, yet no significant difference was noticed (p = 7.053). A
      significantly higher serum periostin in asthmatic patients compared to controls
      was found (p = 0.005). Higher levels of serum periostin, although nonsignificant,
      were recorded in AC patients compared to controls (22.88 +/- 10.01ng/mL and 17.51
      +/- 3.17ng/mL, respectively). Periostin was significantly higher in patients with
      IL13 AA and GA genotypes compared to those with GG genotype (p = 0.016). A
      significant positive correlation between serum periostin and serum IL13 among
      allergic patients was recorded (r = 0.352, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Among Egyptian
      patients, serum level of periostin is significantly associated with asthma and
      positively correlates with IL13 level supporting its utility as a diagnostic
      biomarker. IL13 rs20541 gene polymorphism does not seem to play an obvious role
      in asthma and AC, which requires further evaluation.

TI  - Hyponatremia Is Associated With Post-thrombolysis Hemorrhagic Transformation and 
      Poor Clinical Outcome in Ischemic Stroke Patients.
PG  - 879863
LID - 10.3389/fnmol.2022.879863 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in
      patients with neurological conditions, such as stroke. Studies have shown that it
      is associated with worse clinical outcomes and increased mortality in acute
      ischemic stroke (AIS). However, the role of hyponatremia has not been elucidated 
      in patients with AIS who received intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) therapy.
      Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of serum sodium levels on
      the clinical outcome and hemorrhagic transformation (HT) in patients with AIS who
      received thrombolytic therapy. Methods: Patients diagnosed with AIS who received 
      IVT therapy between May 2015 and December 2020 were included in this study. All
      patients were screened for serum sodium levels immediately after hospital
      admission, before IVT therapy. The occurrence of HT was evaluated using computed 
      tomography (CT) 24 +/- 2 h after thrombolysis. Then, 3-month clinical outcomes
      were obtained by telephone calls or outpatient visits, and poor 3-month clinical 
      outcomes were defined as modified Rankin Scale scores >/=3. The effects of serum 
      sodium levels on the clinical outcome and HT were assessed using the multivariate
      logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the 963 included patients, 82 (8.5%)
      had hyponatremia, 157 (16.3%) developed HT, and 333 (34.6%) had poor 3-month
      outcomes. Of the 82 patients with hyponatremia, 21 (25.6%) developed HT, and 39
      (47.6%) had poor 3-month outcomes. Patients with hyponatremia had a higher
      incidence of post-thrombolysis HT (25.6 vs. 15.4%, p = 0.017) and worse clinical 
      outcome (47.6 vs. 33.4%, p = 0.01) than those with normal serum sodium levels.
      Patients had significantly lower serum sodium levels in those with HT [138.4
      (136.4-140.3, IQR) vs. 139.0 (137.2-140.7, IQR) mmol/L, p = 0.019] and poor 3
      month outcome [139.0 (137.2-140.7) vs. 138.4 (136.7-140.3) mmol/L, p = 0.005]
      than those without. After adjusting for major covariates, the multivariate
      logistic regression analysis revealed that lower serum sodium levels were
      independently associated with an increased risk of HT [odds ratio (OR) = 1.804;
      95% CI: 1.048-3.105] and poor 3-month outcome (OR = 1.647; 95% CI: 1.012-2.679). 
      Conclusion: Lower serum sodium level was an independent risk factor for
      post-thrombolysis HT and poor clinical outcome in patients with AIS who received 
      thrombolytic therapy.

TI  - The Impact of Psychological Capital and Social Capital on Residents' Mental
      Health and Happiness During COVID-19: Evidence From China.
PG  - 962373
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.962373 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This paper studies the mediating and interactive effects of social
      capital on psychological capital and the feeling of happiness from the impact of 
      COVID-19. Since its emergence, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on people's
      mental health and affected their hopes for the future. Lifestyle and economic
      conditions have also been affected and have subsequently impacted people's sense 
      of confidence in life. This could increase the likelihood of many people
      developing mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression. Therefore, it is 
      vital to study the influence of psychological capital and social capital on
      people's subjective psychology and happiness experiences. Materials and Methods: 
      Using an ordered probit model, this paper studied the independent influence and
      interaction between psychological capital and social capital on people's
      happiness. The ordered probit model was chosen because subjective well-being
      (SWB) is an ordered variable. We further used structural equation modeling (SEM) 
      to study the mediating effects of social capital on psychological capital and
      happiness. Results: The regression results showed that both psychological capital
      and social capital were significantly positively correlated with happiness when
      controlling for other factors. In addition, psychological and social capital
      significantly interacted, in which the psychological capital promotes the effect 
      of social capital on happiness. Moreover, the effect of psychological capital on 
      happiness was greater than that of social capital, demonstrating that happiness
      is more greatly influenced by subjective psychological experience. The
      interaction coefficient of psychological and social capital was also significant,
      showing that the two have mutually reinforcing effects on happiness. Finally,
      health, income class, real estate, stranger trust, age, and urban household
      registration had significant positive effects on happiness, while the view of
      money, being female, education had a negative relationship with happiness. The
      SEM results showed that the mediating effect of psychological capital on
      happiness was partly transmitted through social capital: the total effect of
      psychological capital on happiness was highly significant (p < 0.0001), as was
      the total effect of social capital on happiness (p < 0.0001); however, the
      coefficient for psychological capital was greater than that for social capital.
      Through heterogeneity analysis, we found that the relationship between
      psychological capital, social capital, and happiness was significantly positive
      in each sub-sample group. There was also a significant interaction between
      psychological and social capital for men, women, urban and rural residents, and
      higher education background sample groups. However, the interaction was not
      significant in the sample group without higher education. In addition, the
      relationship between the happiness of rural residents and their educational
      background and gender was not significant. Conclusion: We found that
      psychological and social capital have significant positive relationships and
      effects on happiness. Psychological capital demonstrated both direct and indirect
      influences on happiness, and further strengthens the influence of social capital 
      on happiness. These results support a scheme to emphasize psychological support
      during the COVID-19 pandemic period to enhance the mental health of citizens.

TI  - Molecular Genetic Screening in Patients With ACE Inhibitor/Angiotensin Receptor
      Blocker-Induced Angioedema to Explore the Role of Hereditary Angioedema Genes.
PG  - 914376
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.914376 [doi]
AB  - Angioedema is a relatively rare but potentially life-threatening adverse reaction
      to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor
      blockers (ARBs). As with hereditary forms of angioedema (HAE), this adverse
      reaction is mediated by bradykinin. Research suggests that ACEi/ARB-induced
      angioedema has a multifactorial etiology. In addition, recent case reports
      suggest that some ACEi/ARB-induced angioedema patients may carry pathogenic HAE
      variants. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible
      association between ACEi/ARB-induced angioedema and HAE genes via systematic
      molecular genetic screening in a large cohort of ACEi/ARB-induced angioedema
      cases. Targeted re-sequencing of five HAE-associated genes (SERPING1, F12, PLG,
      ANGPT1, and KNG1) was performed in 212 ACEi/ARB-induced angioedema patients
      recruited in Germany/Austria, Sweden, and Denmark, and in 352 controls from a
      German cohort. Among patients, none of the identified variants represented a
      known pathogenic variant for HAE. Moreover, no significant association with
      ACEi/ARB-induced angioedema was found for any of the identified common [minor
      allele frequency (MAF) >5%] or rare (MAF < 5%) variants. However, several
      non-significant trends suggestive of possible protective effects were observed.
      The lowest p-value for an individual variant was found in PLG (rs4252129,
      p.R523W, p = 0.057, p.adjust > 0.999, Fisher's exact test). Variant p.R523W was
      found exclusively in controls and has previously been associated with decreased
      levels of plasminogen, a precursor of plasmin which is part of a pathway directly
      involved in bradykinin production. In addition, rare, potentially functional
      variants (MAF < 5%, Phred-scaled combined annotation dependent depletion score
      >10) showed a nominally significant enrichment in controls both: 1) across all
      five genes; and 2) in the F12 gene alone. However, these results did not
      withstand correction for multiple testing. In conclusion, our results suggest
      that HAE-associated mutations are, at best, a rare cause of ACEi/ARB-induced
      angioedema. Furthermore, we were unable to identify a significant association
      between ACEi/ARB-induced angioedema and other variants in the investigated genes.
      Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to draw more definite
      conclusions concerning variants with limited effect sizes, including protective
      variants.

AB  - OCA (oculocutaneous albinism) refers to a group of heterogeneous congenital
      disorders of which the common manifestations are variable degrees of cutaneous
      hypopigmentation and significant visual impairment, including poor visual acuity,
      photophobia, and nystagmus. Molecular analysis may elucidate its pathogenesis and
      be in favor of accurate diagnosis. High-throughput sequencing and Sanger
      sequencing were performed to detect mutational alleles and in silico analysis was
      performed for prediction of variant pathogenicity. Ten TYR-related and two
      OCA2-related patients were identified with 16 different variants with potential
      pathogenicity. Two novel missense variants [TYR: c.623T > G, p(Leu208Arg) and
      OCA2: c.1325A > G, p(Asn442Ser)] are identified in this study, and three OCA
      cases are reported for the first time in Chinese population based on their
      associated variants. Analysis of crystal structures of TYR ortholog and its
      paralog TYRP1 suggests that the substitution of Leu(208) may have an impact on
      protein stability. This study may facilitate OCA diagnosis by expanding the
      mutational spectrum of TYR and OCA2 as well as further basic studies about these 
      two genes.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the associations between endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) stress-related genes EIF2AK3/PERK, HSPA5/GRP78, and DDIT3/CHOP
      polymorphisms and the risk of lung cancer. Methods: Six single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) of EIF2AK3, HSPA5, and DDIT3 were genotyped in 620 cases and
      620 controls using a MassARRAY platform. Results: The minor allele A of rs6750998
      was a protective allele against the risk of lung cancer (p < 0.001), while the
      minor alleles of rs867529, rs391957, and rs697221 were all risk alleles that may 
      lead to multiplied risk of the disease (rp rs867529 = 0.002; p rs391957 = 0.015; 
      p rs697221 < 0.001). Moreover, the rs6750998-TA/AA genotypes were protective
      genotypes against the risk of lung cancer (p = 0.005); however, the
      rs867529-GC/CC, rs391957-CC, and rs697221-GA/AA genotypes were associated with
      elevated lung cancer risk (p rs867529 = 0.003, p rs391957 = 0.028, and p rs697221
      = 0.0001). In addition, EIF2AK3-rs6750998 was associated with a decreased risk of
      lung cancer under dominant, recessive, and log-additive models (p < 0.05). By
      contrast, the EIF2AK3-rs867529 was correlated with an increased risk of the
      disease under dominant and log-additive models (p = 0.001). Moreover,
      HSPA5-rs391957 was related to an elevated risk of the disease under recessive and
      log-additive models (p < 0.02). DDIT3-rs697221 was identified to have a
      significant association with the risk of lung cancer under all three genetic
      models (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Our results provide new insights on the role of
      the ER stress-related genes EIF2AK3, HSPA5, and DDIT3 polymorphisms for lung
      cancer risk.

AB  - P. trituberculatus is an economically important mariculture species in China.
      Evaluating its genetic diversity and population structure can contribute to the
      exploration of germplasm resources and promote sustainable aquaculture
      production. In this study, a total of 246,243 SSRs were generated by
      transcriptome sequencing of P. trituberculatus. Among the examined 254,746
      unigenes, 66,331 had more than one SSR. Among the different SSR motif types,
      dinucleotide repeats (110,758, 44.98%) were the most abundant. In 173 different
      base repeats, A/T (96.86%), AC/GT (51.46%), and ACC/GGT (26.20%) were dominant in
      mono-, di-, and trinucleotide, respectively. GO annotations showed 87,079
      unigenes in 57 GO terms. Cellular process, cell, and binding were the most
      abundant terms in biological process, cellular component, and molecular function 
      categories separately. A total of 34,406 annotated unigenes were classified into 
      26 functional categories according to the functional annotation analysis of KOG, 
      of which "general function prediction only" was the biggest category (6,028
      unigenes, 17.52%). KEGG pathway annotations revealed the clustering of 34,715
      unigenes into 32 different pathways. Nineteen SSRs were identified as polymorphic
      and, thus, used to assess the genetic diversity and structure of 240 P.
      trituberculatus individuals from four populations in the Bohai Sea. Genetic
      parameter analysis showed a similar level of genetic diversity within wild
      populations, and the cultured population indicated a reduction in genetic
      diversity compared with wild populations. The pairwise FST values were between
      0.001 and 0.04 with an average of 0.0205 (p < 0.05), suggesting a low but
      significant level of genetic differentiation among the four populations.
      Structure analysis demonstrated that the four populations were classified into
      two groups including the cultured group and other populations. The phylogenetic
      tree and PCA revealed that a vast number of samples were clustered together and
      that cultivated individuals were distributed more centrally than wild
      individuals. The findings contribute to the further assessment of germplasm
      resources and assist to provide valuable SSRs for marker-assisted breeding of P. 
      trituberculatus in the future.

TI  - Prognostic Model and Nomogram Construction and Validation With an
      Autophagy-Related Gene Signature in Low-Grade Gliomas.

AB  - Background : Autophagy plays a vital role in cancer development. However, the
      prognostic value of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) in low-grade gliomas (LGG) is 
      unclear. This research aimed to investigate whether ARGs correlated with overall 
      survival (OS) in LGG patients. Methods: RNA-sequencing data were obtained from
      The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) TARGET GTEx database. Gene Ontology and Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis of ARGs were performed by
      the "clusterprofile" R package. Cox regression with the wald chi(2) test was
      employed to identify prognostic significant ARGs. Next, the receiver operator
      characteristic curves were established to evaluate the feasibility of risk score 
      ( riskscore = h 0 ( t ) exp ( summation operator j = 1 n Coef j x X j ) ) and
      other clinical risk factors to predict prognosis. A nomogram was constructed.
      Correlations between clinical features and ARGs were further verified by a t-test
      or Kruskal-Wallis test. In addition, the correlations between autophagy and
      immune cells were assessed through the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis
      (ssGSEA) and tumor immune estimation resource database. Last, the prediction
      model was verified by LGG data downloaded from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas
      (CGGA) database. Results: Overall, 35 DE-ARGs were identified. Functional
      enrichment analysis showed that these genes were mainly related to oxidative
      stress and regulation of autophagy. Nine ARGs (BAX, BIRC5, CFLAR, DIRAS3, GRID2, 
      MAPK9, MYC, PTK6, and TP53) were significantly associated with OS. Age (Hazard
      ratio (HR) = 1.063, 95% CI: 1.046-1.080), grade (HR = 3.412, 95% CI:
      2.164-5.379), histological type (HR = 0.556, 95% CI: 0.346-0.893), and risk score
      (HR = 1.135, 95% CI: 1.104-1.167) were independent prognostic risk factors (all p
      < 0.05). In addition, BIRC5, CFLAR, DIRAS3, TP53, and risk scores were found to
      correlate significantly with age and tumor grade (all p < 0.05). Immune cell
      enrichment analysis demonstrated that the types of immune cells and their
      expression levels in the high-risk group were significantly different from those 
      in the low-risk group (all p < 0.05). A prognostic nomogram was constructed to
      predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, and the prognostic value of sorted ARGs were
      verified in the CGGA database and clinical samples. Conclusion: Our findings
      suggest that the 9 DE-ARGs' risk score model could serve as diagnostic and
      prognostic biomarkers. The prognostic nomograms could be useful for
      individualized survival prediction and improved treatment strategies.

AB  - Since the occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global coronavirus disease
      2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 
      at the genetic level would help combat COVID-19, particularly for long COVID. We 
      performed a genetic analysis of ACE2 and searched for its common potential single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency >0.05 in both
      European and Chinese populations that would contribute to ACE2 gene expression
      variation. We thought that the variation of the ACE2 expression would be an
      important biological feature that would strongly affect COVID-19 symptoms, such
      as "brain fog", which is highlighted by the fact that ACE2 acts as a major
      cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and is highly expressed in brain
      tissues. Based on the human GTEx gene expression database, we found rs2106809
      exhibited a significant correlation with the ACE2 expression among multiple brain
      and artery tissues. This expression correlation was replicated in an independent 
      European brain eQTL database, Braineac. rs2106809*G also displays significantly
      higher frequency in Asian populations than in Europeans and displays a protective
      effect (p = 0.047) against COVID-19 hospitalization when comparing hospitalized
      COVID-19 cases with non-hospitalized COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 test-negative samples
      with European ancestry from the UK Biobank. Furthermore, we experimentally
      demonstrated that rs2106809*G could upregulate the transcriptional activity of
      ACE2. Therefore, integrative analysis and functional experiment strongly support 
      that ACE2 SNP rs2106809 is a functional brain eQTL and its potential involvement 
      in long COVID, which warrants further investigation.

TI  - Variable Clinical Features in a Large Family With Diamond Blackfan Anemia Caused 
      by a Pathogenic Missense Mutation in RPS19.
PG  - 914141
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.914141 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an autosomal dominant
      ribosomopathy caused predominantly by pathogenic germline variants in ribosomal
      protein genes. It is characterized by failure of red blood cell production, and
      common features include congenital malformations and cancer predisposition.
      Mainstays of treatment are corticosteroids, red blood cell transfusions, and
      hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Despite a better understanding of
      the genotype of DBA, the biological mechanism resulting in the clinical phenotype
      remains poorly understood, and wide heterogeneity can be seen even within a
      single family as depicted here. Case Description: Thirty family members enrolled 
      in the National Cancer Institute inherited bone marrow failure syndromes study
      were evaluated with detailed medical questionnaires and physical examinations,
      including 22 in the family bloodline and eight unrelated partners. Eight
      participants had been previously told they had DBA by clinical criteria. Targeted
      germline RPS19 testing was done on all family members. A pathogenic heterozygous 
      missense mutation in RPS19 (p.R62Q, c.185G > A) was detected in ten family
      members, including one person previously presumed unaffected. Eight family
      members presented with macrocytic anemia in infancy; all of whom were responsive 
      to prednisone. Four family members became treatment independent; however, one
      individual became transfusion-dependent 36 years later following an episode of
      pneumonia. One prednisone responsive individual electively discontinued steroid
      treatment, and lives with severe anemia. One prednisone responsive individual
      died at age 28 from a stroke. Two family members developed colorectal cancer in
      their fifties; one had never required treatment for anemia. None had major
      congenital anomalies. Discussion: This large family with DBA demonstrates the
      heterogeneity of phenotypes that can be seen within the same genotype. Most
      family members presented with steroid-responsive anemia in infancy and subtle
      congenital malformations, findings consistent with recent genotype-phenotype
      studies of RPS DBA. However, two family members were relatively unaffected,
      underscoring the importance of further studies to assess modifier genes, and
      epigenetic and/or environmental factors which may result in normal erythropoiesis
      despite underlying ribosome dysfunction. This large, multigenerational family
      highlights the need for individualized treatment, the importance of early cancer 
      surveillance even in individuals with clinically mild phenotypes, and the benefit
      of long-term follow-up to identify late complications.

TI  - Psycho-Social Effects of Pet Dog Ownership on Mentally Challenged Children.
PG  - e26389
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26389 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Mental retardation is a social stigma and children affected by this
      condition always require love and compassion. Pets have a positive role in human 
      life to relieve stress and anxiety. Pets are therefore considered to be a very
      important aspect of psychological therapy. Those children who are suffering from 
      mental retardation have to be given regular stress and anxiety-relieving
      sessions. Hence this study aims to analyze the psychosocial effects of pet dog
      ownership on mentally challenged children. METHODOLOGY: A total of 112 children
      were included in the study and were counseled at the Department of Pediatrics,
      District Hospital, Amritsar. Twenty patients were lost to follow up and pet
      ownership materialized in 52 patients. The study was divided into 2 groups, the
      compliant group (n=52) and the non-compliant group (n=40). Hamilton anxiety scale
      (HAM-A) was applied to all the children before pet dog ownership (PRE) and after 
      3-6 months with a pet dog (POST). The pre and post-scores of all the children
      were recorded and subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: The HAM-A score
      before pet ownership was comparable, before pet ownership (p=.825), but after 3-6
      months of pet ownership significant difference was observed between compliant and
      non-compliant groups (p<.001). Also, the HAM-A score in children with mild mental
      retardation (mild MR) and moderate mental retardation (moderate MR) was
      significantly less than the non-compliant group after 3-6 months. We also
      observed that the decrease in the anxiety levels was comparable in children who
      owned local breeds and foreign breeds. CONCLUSION: This short-term follow-up
      research highlights the potential advantages of keeping a companion dog for
      youngsters with mental problems in terms of improving their lives. Many of these 
      long-term gains might be attributed to lessening tensions within families.

TI  - Effects of Betahistine on Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex in Normal Healthy Adults: A
      Randomized Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.
PG  - e26452
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26452 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Vertigo, or the perception of a spinning sensation, is a common
      symptom experienced by patients who are referred to Otorhinolaryngology clinics. 
      Betahistine is a medication that has been widely used to treat vertigo and its
      accompanying symptoms. However, the effects of this medication on the
      vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) are still unknown. Initially, it was assumed that
      betahistine should be discontinued prior to any vestibular tests, particularly
      the video head impulse test (vHIT). Method Thirty young healthy adults were
      randomly divided into two equal groups for this randomized double-blind clinical 
      study (betahistine 24 mg and placebo). Baseline pure-tone audiometry (PTA),
      tympanometry, and VOR measurements were taken, followed by experimental
      measurements at one hour, four hours, eight hours, and 24 hours after
      consumption. The video head impulse test (vHIT) was used to determine the VOR.
      Result Betahistine had no statistically significant effect on vestibulo-ocular
      reflex gain (F(4,140) = 0.601, p = 0.662). The gain variability across repetitive
      head impulses remained constant over time. Conclusions Betahistine has no effect 
      on the vestibulo-ocular reflex. As a result, this medication can be taken prior
      to the vHIT procedure.

TI  - Adherence to Antithrombotic Therapy for Patients Attending a Multidisciplinary
      Thrombosis Service in Canada - A Cross-Sectional Survey.
PG  - 1771-1780
LID - 10.2147/PPA.S367105 [doi]
AB  - Background: Poor medication adherence puts patients who require antithrombotic
      therapy at greater risk of complications. We started a multidisciplinary Adult
      Outpatient Thrombosis Service in 2017 in a Canadian health authority and were
      interested in the level of medication adherence in the population attending.
      AimS: The aim of this study is to assess adherence to antithrombotic medications 
      for patients attending a multidisciplinary Thrombosis Service. Methods: We
      conducted a cross-sectional survey of outpatients seen at the Thrombosis Service 
      between 2017 and 2019 using the 12-item validated Adherence to Refills and
      Medications Scale (ARMS) to assess adherence to antithrombotic (anticoagulants
      and antiplatelet) therapy. Linear regression analysis examined the factors
      associated with adherence to antithrombotic therapy. Results: Of 1058 eligible
      patients, 53.2% responded to the survey. Seventeen were excluded from the
      analysis for missing more than 6 responses to the 12 items on the ARMS. About 55%
      (n = 297) were on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), 19% (n = 102) on warfarin, 
      5.0% (n = 27) on low molecular weight heparin, 3.3% (n = 18) on antiplatelet
      therapy and 18% (n = 96) were no longer on antithrombotic therapy. Nearly half
      (47%, n = 253) had taken antithrombotic therapy for 1-5 years while 28% (n = 150)
      and 25% (n = 137) had taken antithrombotic treatments for <1 and >5 years,
      respectively. Most patients (87%, n = 475) were >/=50 years and half (51%, n =
      277) were male. The mean adherence score was 13.9 (SD+/-2.2) and 88% (n = 481) of
      participants were adherent to antithrombotic treatment (ARMS = 12-16).
      Multivariable linear regression showed that patients with post-graduate education
      had 0.4% lower adherence to antithrombotic therapy as compared with elementary
      education (beta = 0.0039, p = 0.048). Patients with prior antithrombotic agent
      use >5 years had 0.5% lower adherence to antithrombotic treatment compared to
      patients with <1 year (beta = 0.0047, p = 0.0244). Conclusion: Self-reported
      adherence to antithrombotic therapy was high (88%) within a multidisciplinary
      Thrombosis Service. Patients with advanced education and prolong duration of
      antithrombotic therapy were more likely to have lower self-reported adherence to 
      antithrombotic treatment.

      Bayesian Networks to Elucidate Complex Relationships.
PG  - 1819-1829
LID - 10.2147/PPA.S369380 [doi]
AB  - Aim: To explore the correlation of exercise anticipation, self-efficacy and lower
      limb function in the elderly, and identify active predictors of exercise. The
      time up and go (TUG) has been used to access basic mobility skills, as well as
      strength, balance and agility, which is used in a range of population. Methods: A
      cross-sectional survey approach was employed in this study, assessing the
      functional relationship of the level of exercise anticipation, modified gait
      efficacy scale (mGES), self-efficacy for exercise scale (SEE), perceived efficacy
      of patient-physician interactions (PEPPI-10), behavioral regulation in exercise
      questionnaire (BREQ), and the time up and go (TUG) and International Physical
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Consequently, we constructed the Bayesian network 
      model utilizing Genie 2.3, in order to effectively determine clear negative and
      positive correlations. Results: This investigation incorporated a total of 285
      patients. The results of Spearman's correlation analysis indicated that the TUG
      effectively correlated with age (r = 0.158, P < 0.01), drinking (r=-0.362, P <
      0.01), mGES (r=-0.254, P < 0.01), PEPPI (r=-0.329, P < 0.01), SEE (r =-0.408, P <
      0.01), BREQ (r = 0.676, P < 0.01), EA (r =-0.688, P < 0.01) and IPAQ (r =-0.742, 
      P < 0.01). TUG can be used as the direct influencing factor of IPA, and five
      nodes in the model can be considered the primary indirect influencing factors of 
      TUG, such as drinking, EA, age, sex and mGES in Bayesian network. The sensitivity
      analysis of the model confirmed that TUG (0.059), drinking (0.087), EA (0.335),
      age (0.080), sex (0.164), mGES (0.028) and hypertension (0.030) can become the
      sensitivity evaluation indicators of IPAQ in the elderly community population, in
      which the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 59.6% (2207/3705), indicating a
      suitable prediction performance. Conclusion: Exercise anticipation and life
      behavior habit can effectively predict physical activity capability in the
      elderly. These findings can help clinicians establish effective intervention to
      improve the physical activity regularly of the elderly.

      for the Treatment of Schizophrenia.
PG  - 1805-1817
LID - 10.2147/PPA.S362889 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: A recent, phase 3b, mirror-image clinical trial of outpatients with
      schizophrenia found that use of aripiprazole tablets with sensor (AS; Abilify
      MyCite((R)), comprising an ingestible event-marker sensor embedded in
      aripiprazole tablets, wearable sensor patches, and a smartphone application)
      reduced the incidence of psychiatric hospitalizations relative to oral
      standard-of-care antipsychotics. This analysis explored the relationship between 
      AS engagement by participants and changes in participant performance and
      symptom-severity measures assessed by clinical raters. Participants and Methods: 
      This post hoc analysis used prospectively collected clinical data from a phase 3b
      clinical trial (NCT03892889). Outpatients had schizophrenia, were aged 18-65
      years, and had >/= 1 psychiatric hospitalization in the previous 48 months.
      Participants were grouped by study completion status and a k-means clustering
      algorithm based on AS utilization, resulting in 3 groups: discontinued
      (discontinued AS before month 3 of the study); moderate engagement (completed 3
      months, used AS intermittently); and high engagement (completed 3 months, used AS
      regularly). Baseline to end-of-study differences for the Clinical Global
      Impression Scale (Severity of Illness and Improvement of Illness scales),
      Personal and Social Performance Scale, and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      were calculated. Results: A total of 277 outpatients were enrolled (discontinued,
      n = 164; moderate engagement, n = 63; high engagement, n = 50). All groups
      experienced symptom improvement from baseline to end-of-study, with significant
      changes in the more-engaged groups. Highly engaged participants showed
      significant improvement for all clinical scores and subscores (all P < 0.05) and 
      demonstrated significantly more improvement in symptoms than participants with
      less engagement. Conclusion: Participants who completed 3 months of the study and
      had higher AS engagement experienced significantly greater improvement in their
      end-of-study clinical assessments versus participants who did not complete 3
      months. Improvement may be related to more-consistent medication intake and
      better engagement with a digital health system.

AB  - Background: Subjective beliefs about chronic disease conditions and their drug
      management are among factors determining adherence to medications that are
      amenable to interventions. Patient-level factors such as personal, cultural, and 
      religious beliefs about diseases, and medication use may have a significant

      impact of personal, cultural and religious beliefs on medication adherence
      behavior among patients with chronic follow-up. Patients and Methods: An
      institutional-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among chronic
      ambulatory patients from July to August 2021. The data was collected through an
      interviewer administered questionnaire. Initially stratified sampling technique
      was used to include proportional participants from different disease conditions, 
      and systematic random sampling was employed to enroll eligible patients from each
      subgroup. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages were
      computed for categorical variables and mean with (standard deviation +/-SD) used 
      for continuous variables. Logistic regression model was employed to determine
      variable with poor adherence. A 95% confidence interval with P-value </=0.05 was 
      used to declare statically significance. Results: Among the 404 participants,
      more than half (51%) were males. The mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 47.8
      +/- 14.8 years. Patients with strong belief in the harm of medications were found
      4 times more likely to have poor medication adherence than those with weak belief
      in the harm of medications (AOR = 4.027, 95% CI:1.232-13.161, P = 0.021). In
      contrast, having strong personal belief regarding the necessity of medications
      were found to be less likely to have poor medication adherence (AOR = 0.368, 95% 
      CI: 0.220-0.615, P < 0.001). Conclusion: This study generalized that most of the 
      patients were poor adherent to their medications. Personal beliefs were found to 
      influence medication adherence of the patients. Future studies could be needed to
      explore and identify how these factors affect patients' medication adherence.

AB  - Background: Haiti introduced a monovalent human group A rotavirus (RVA) vaccine
      (Rotarix) into its routine infant immunization program in April 2014. The goal of
      the surveillance program was to characterize RVA strains circulating in Haiti
      before and after RVA vaccine introduction. Methods: Stool samples were collected 
      from children <5 years old presenting with acute gastroenteritis at 16 hospitals 
      in Haiti. RVA antigen enzyme immunoassay (EIA) testing was performed, and G and P
      genotypes were determined for positive specimens. In this study, genotype data
      for samples collected from May 2012 through April 2014 (the pre-vaccine
      introduction era) and May 2014 through July 2019 (post-vaccine introduction era) 
      were analyzed. Results: A total of 809 specimens were tested by the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention. During the pre-vaccine introduction era (May 2012
      through April 2014), G12P[8] was the predominant genotype, detected in 88-94% of 
      specimens. There was a high prevalence of the equine-like G3P[8] genotype among
      Haitian children with RVA after vaccine introduction. Conclusions: The
      predominance of equine-like G3P[8] in three of five RVA seasons post-vaccine
      introduction suggests possible vaccine-specific selection pressure in Haiti.
      These temporal variations in RVA genotype predominance will require continued
      monitoring in Haiti as the vaccination program continues.

AB  - Polyopes affinis ((Harvey) Kawaguchi & Wang, 2002) is a red alga in the order
      Halymeniales of the phylum Rhodophyta. The entire mitogenome of P. affinis was
      sequenced and compared to related Halymeniales species. The entire
      circular-mitogenome is 25,988 bp long, has 27.59% GC content, and comprises 25
      protein-coding genes (CDS), 23 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and three ribosomal RNA
      (rRNA) genes. In terms of gene synteny and tRNA composition, the P. affinis
      mitogenome differs significantly from that of P. lancifolius. Phylogenetic
      analysis shows P. affinis mitogenome in a branch sister to P. lancifolius,
      indicating a close relationship with other Halymeniales species.

      Endothelial Progenitor Cells, Proangiogenic Cells, and Endothelial Function.
PG  - 894093
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.894093 [doi]
AB  - Background: Subclinical thyrotoxicosis (SCT) is defined by low or undetectable
      thyroid-stimulating hormones and normal thyroid hormones. The treatment of SCT is
      uncertain despite being associated with increased cardiovascular risk (CVR) and
      mortality. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPCs) and circulating
      angiogenic cells (CACs) have been found to be reduced in conditions with CVR. We 
      aimed to evaluate whether endothelial function and cEPC and CAC counts were
      reduced in SCT and to study the in vitro effect of triiodothyronine (T3) on
      proangiogenic cell (PAC) function from young healthy controls. Methods: cEPCs
      (quantified by flow cytometry, 20 SCT/20 controls), CACs following in vitro
      cultures (15 SCT/14 controls), paracrine function of CACs, endothelial function
      by flow-mediated dilation (FMD, 9 SCT/9 controls), and the effect of T3 on
      apoptosis and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in PACs were
      studied. Results: p < 0.001, CD133(+)/VEGFR-2(+) 0.4 (0.0-0.7) vs. 0.6 (0.0-4.6),
      p = 0.009, CD34(+)/VEGFR-2(+) 0.3 (0.0-1.0) vs. 0.7 (0.1-4.9), p = 0.002; while
      CAC count was similar. SCT predicted a lower cEPC count after adjustment for
      conventional CVR factors. FMD was lower in SCT subjects versus controls (% mean
      +/- SD, 2.7 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.1 +/- 2.3, p = 0.005). In vitro studies showed T3
      increased early apoptosis and reduced eNOS expression in PACs. Conclusions: In
      conclusion, SCT is associated with reduced cEPC count and FMD, confirming
      increased CVR in SCT. Future outcome trials are required to examine if treatment 
      of this subclinical hyperactive state improves cardiovascular outcome. Clinical

TI  - HemoglobinA1c Is a Risk Factor for Changes of Bone Mineral Density: A Mendelian
      Randomization Study.
PG  - 942878
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.942878 [doi]
AB  - Background: As a valuable blood glucose measurement, HemoglobinA1c (HbA1c) is of 
      great clinical value for diabetes. However, in previous observational studies,
      studies on its effect on bone mineral density (BMD) have different results. This 
      study aimed to use Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the effect of HbA1c on 
      bone mineral density and fracture risk, and try to further explore whether this
      association was achieved through glycemic or non-glycemic factors. Methods: Take 
      HbA1c measurement as exposure, and BMD estimated from quantitative heel
      ultrasounds (eBMD) and bone fractures as outcomes. Two-Sample MR Analysis was
      conducted to assess the causal effect of HbA1C on heel BMD and risk fracture.
      Then, we performed the analysis using two subsets of these variants, one related 
      to glycemic measurement and the other to erythrocyte indices. Results:
      Genetically increased HbA1C was associated with the lower heel eBMD [odds ratio
      (OR) 0.91 (95% CI 0.87, 0.96) per %-unit, P = 3 x 10-4(IVW)]. Higher HbA1C was
      associated with lower heel eBMD when using only erythrocytic variants [OR 0.87
      (0.82, 0.93), P=2x 10-5(IVW)]; However, when using only glycemic variants, this
      casual association does not hold. In further MR analysis, we test the association
      of erythrocytic traits with heel eBMD. Conclusion: Our study revealed the
      significant causal effect of HbA1c on eBMD, and this causal link might achieve
      through non-glycemic pathways (erythrocytic indices).

TI  - The Association Between the Triglyceride-to-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol 
      Ratio and the Risk of Progression to Diabetes From Prediabetes: A 5-year Cohort
      Study in Chinese Adults.
PG  - 947157
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.947157 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Evidence regarding the relationship between the
      triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-c) ratio and the
      risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes remains limited. The purpose of 
      our study was to investigate the relationship between the TG/HDL-C ratio and
      incident diabetes in prediabetic patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort
      study covered 32 regions and 11 cities in China and consecutively and
      non-selectively collected data from 15,017 patients with prediabetes who had
      received a health check from 2010 to 2016. Data were obtained from the DATADRYAD 
      database (www.datadryad.org). The Cox proportional-hazards regression model with 
      cubic spline functions and smooth curve fitting (cubic spline smoothing) was used
      to explore the non-linear relationship between the baseline TG/HDL-c ratio and
      the risk of diabetes in patients with prediabetes. In addition, we performed a
      series of sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Results: The mean age of the
      included individuals was 50.95 +/- 13.48 years, and 9,745 (64.51%) were men. The 
      median (interquartile range) TG/HDL-c ratio was 1.09 (0.69-1.72). During a median
      follow-up time of 3.05 years, 1,731 (11.46%) patients had a final diagnosis of
      diabetes. The analysis after adjusting for covariates showed that the TG/HDL-c
      ratio was positively related to incident diabetes in patients with prediabetes
      (HR = 1.111, 95% CI 1.061-1.164). Participants with the highest TG/HDL-c ratio
      (Q4) had higher diabetes incidence rates than those with the lowest TG/HDL-c
      ratio (Q1) (P < 0.001 for the trend). There was a non-linear relationship between
      the TG/HDL-c ratio and the risk of diabetes, and the inflection point of the
      TG/HDL-c ratio was 1.415. The effect sizes (HR) on the left and right sides of
      the inflection point were 1.336 (95% CI: 1.134-1.573) and 1.055 (95% CI:
      0.988-1.126), respectively. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness 
      of these results. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a positive, non-linear
      relationship between the TG/HDL-c ratio and the risk of diabetes in Chinese
      patients with prediabetes. Aggressive intervention from a treatment perspective
      is required to lower the TG/HDL-c ratio below the inflection point (1.415) by
      lowering TG or increasing HDL-c levels.

      Metastasis for Unilateral Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: Preliminary Results.
PG  - 921845
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.921845 [doi]
AB  - Background: The aims of this study were to assess the clinical value of
      pretracheal lymph node subdivision in identifying patients with contralateral
      central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) and risk factors for occult contralateral
      CLNM in unilateral PTC. Methods: A total of 139 unilateral PTC patients with a
      clinically node-negative neck (cN0) who underwent bilateral central neck
      dissection (CND) were prospectively enrolled. Intraoperatively, the pretracheal
      region was further divided into ipsilateral and contralateral subregions.
      Ipsilateral and contralateral pretracheal lymph nodes (LNs) as well as other CLNs
      (prelaryngeal, ipsilateral paratracheal and contralateral paratracheal) were
      labeled separately and sent for pathological examination. Demographic and
      clinicopathologic variables were analyzed to identify factors predictive of
      contralateral CLNM. Results: Of 139 patients, bilateral CLNM was present in 37
      (26.6%) patients. Contralateral pretracheal LNM was significantly associated with
      contralateral CLNM. In multivariate analysis, prelaryngeal LNM (P = 0.004, odds
      ratio = 3.457) and contralateral pretracheal LNM (P = 0.006, odds ratio = 3.362) 
      were identified as risk factors for contralateral CLNM. Neither neck recurrence
      nor distant metastasis was observed within the mean follow-up duration of 9.1 +/-
      1.8 months. Conclusions: In most unilateral cN0 PTCs, performing ipsilateral CND 
      is appropriate, while patients presenting with evident nodal disease
      intraoperatively or preoperatively in the contralateral central neck should
      undergo bilateral CND. Intraoperative re-evaluation of prelaryngeal and
      contralateral pretracheal LNs may be helpful in determining the extent of CND.

      of Lipoprotein Lipase in Two Pedigrees With Type I Hyperlipoproteinemia.
PG  - 874608
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.874608 [doi]
AB  - Background: Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, characterized by severe
      hypertriglyceridemia, is caused mainly by loss-of-function mutation of the
      lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene. To date, more than 200 mutations in the LPL gene
      have been reported, while only a limited number of mutations have been evaluated 
      for pathogenesis. Objective: This study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying lipoprotein lipase deficiency in two pedigrees with type 1
      hyperlipoproteinemia. Methods: We conducted a systematic clinical and genetic
      analysis of two pedigrees with type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia. Postheparin plasma of
      all the members was used for the LPL activity analysis. In vitro studies were
      performed in HEK-293T cells that were transiently transfected with wild-type or
      variant LPL plasmids. Furthermore, the production and activity of LPL were
      analyzed in cell lysates or culture medium. Results: Proband 1 developed acute
      pancreatitis in youth, and her serum triglycerides (TGs) continued to be at an
      ultrahigh level, despite the application of various lipid-lowering drugs. Proband
      2 was diagnosed with type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia at 9 months of age, and his
      serum TG levels were mildly elevated with treatment. Two novel compound
      heterozygous variants of LPL (c.3G>C, p. M1? and c.835_836delCT, p. L279Vfs*3,
      c.188C>T, p. Ser63Phe and c.662T>C, p. Ile221Thr) were identified in the two
      probands. The postheparin LPL activity of probands 1 and 2 showed decreases of
      72.22 +/- 9.46% (p<0.01) and 54.60 +/- 9.03% (p<0.01), respectively, compared
      with the control. In vitro studies showed a substantial reduction in the
      expression or enzyme activity of LPL in the LPL variants. Conclusions: Two novel 
      compound heterozygous variants of LPL induced defects in the expression and
      function of LPL and caused type I hyperlipoproteinemia. The functional
      characterization of these variants was in keeping with the postulated LPL mutant 
      activity.

TI  - A Machine Learning Model Based on Health Records for Predicting Recurrence After 
      Microwave Ablation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 671-684
LID - 10.2147/JHC.S358197 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aim: Early recurrence (ER) presents a challenge for the survival
      prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study 
      was to investigate machine learning (ML) models using clinical data for
      predicting ER after microwave ablation (MWA). Methods: Between August 2005 and
      December 2019, 1574 patients with early-stage HCC underwent MWA at four hospitals
      were reviewed. Then, 36 clinical data points per patient were collected, and the 
      patients were assigned to the training, internal, and external validation set.
      Apart from traditional logistic regression (LR), three ML models-random forest,
      support vector machine, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)-were built and
      validated for their predictive ability with the area under ROC curve (AUC).
      Algorithms such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and local interpretable
      model-agnostic explanations (LIME) were used to realize their interpretability.
      Results: The three ML models all outperformed LR (P < 0.001 for all) in
      predictive ability. When nine variables (tumor number, platelet,
      alpha-fetoprotein, comorbidity score, white blood cell, cholinesterase,
      prothrombin time, neutrophils, and etiology) were extracted simultaneously using 
      recursive feature elimination with cross-validation, the XGBoost model achieved
      the best discrimination among all models, with an AUC value 0.75 (95% CI
      [confidence interval]: 0.72-0.78) in the training set, 0.74 (95% CI: 0.69-0.80)
      in the internal validation set, and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.82) in the external
      validation set, and it was interpreted depending on the visualization of risk
      factors by the SHAP and LIME algorithms. The predictive system of post-ablation
      recurrence risk stratification was provided on online
      (http://114.251.235.51:8001/) based on XGboost analysis. Conclusion: The XGBoost 
      model based on clinical data can effectively predict ER risk after MWA, which can
      contribute to surveillance, prevention, and treatment strategies for HCC.

AB  - Purpose: Malnutrition is a major risk factor of immune dysfunction and poor
      outcome in cancer patients. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI), which is
      established by serum albumin level and peripheral lymphocyte count, was shown to 
      correlate with prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients following
      liver resection and non-surgical interventions. The aim of this study was to
      analyze the predictive value of preoperative PNI in liver transplantation (LT)
      patients with HCC. Patients and Methods: A total of 123 HCC patients that
      underwent LT were included in the analysis. The prognostic impact of
      preoperatively assessed clinical factors including the PNI on post-LT outcome was
      analyzed by uni- and multivariate analysis. Results: Post-transplant tumor
      recurrence rates were 5.1% in high-PNI (> 42) and 55.6% in low-PNI (</= 42)
      patients (p < 0.001). Preoperative high-PNI could be identified as a significant 
      and independent promoter of both recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] =
      10.12, 95% CI: 3.40-30.10; p < 0.001) and overall survival (HR = 1.69, 95% CI:
      1.02-2.79; p = 0.004) following LT. Apart from that low-PNI proved to be a
      significant and independent predictor of microvascular tumor invasion (OR = 7.71,
      95% CI: 3.17-18.76; p < 0.001). In contrast, no tumor morphology features
      including the Milan criteria revealed an independent prognostic value.
      Conclusion: Our data indicate that preoperative PNI correlates with biological
      tumor aggressiveness and outcome following LT in HCC patients and may therefore
      be useful for refining oncologic risk stratification.

PG  - 1376
LID - 10.4102/sajhivmed.v23i1.1376 [doi]
AB  - Background: There are limited data on the outcomes of rechallenge with
      anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) following anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver
      injury (AT-DILI) in a high HIV prevalence setting. Objectives: To describe the
      outcomes of rechallenge with first-line ATT. Method: Hospitalised participants
      with AT-DILI who were enrolled into a randomised controlled trial of
      N-acetylcysteine in Cape Town, South Africa, were followed up until completion of
      ATT rechallenge. We described rechallenge outcomes, and identified associations
      with recurrence of liver injury on rechallenge (positive rechallenge). Results:
      Seventy-nine participants were rechallenged of whom 41 (52%) were female. Mean
      age was 37 years (standard deviation [s.d.] +/-10). Sixty-eight (86%) were
      HIV-positive, of whom 34 (50%) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at time of
      AT-DILI presentation. Five participants had serious adverse reactions to an
      aminoglycoside included in the alternate ATT regimen given after first-line ATT
      interruption: acute kidney injury in three and hearing loss in two. The median
      time from first-line ATT interruption to start of first-line ATT rechallenge was 
      13 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 8-18 days). Antiretroviral therapy was
      interrupted for a median of 32 days (IQR: 17-58) among HIV-positive participants 
      on ART before AT-DILI. Fourteen participants had positive rechallenge (18%).
      Positive rechallenge was associated with pyrazinamide rechallenge (P = 0.005),
      female sex (P = 0.039) and first episode of tuberculosis (TB) (P = 0.032).
      Conclusion: Rechallenge was successful in most of our cohort. Pyrazinamide
      rechallenge should be carefully considered.

TI  - Utility of Measuring Fetal Cavum Septum Pellucidum (CSP) Width During Routine
      Obstetrical Ultrasound for Improving Diagnosis of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome: A
      Case-Control Study.
PG  - 87-95
LID - 10.2147/TACG.S364543 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the utility of measuring fetal cavum septum pellucidum
      (CSP) width during routine, mid-pregnancy ultrasound for improving diagnosis of
      22q11.2 deletion syndrome amongst fetuses with and without conotruncal anomalies.
      Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective case-control study (2005-2016).
      Fetuses and newborns with 22q11.2 deletion and/or conotruncal cardiac anomalies
      were identified using a regional, clinical database. A control group was
      assembled in a 2:1 ratio to create three groups for comparison: i) 22q11.2
      deletion syndrome; ii) isolated conotruncal anomalies; and iii) controls.
      Eligibility was restricted to those with stored ultrasound images between 18-22
      weeks' gestation and a minimum biparietal diameter of 40 mm. Post-processing
      measurement of CSP width was performed in a standardized fashion by two blinded
      and independent study personnel. Descriptive and inferential statistics,
      regression modeling, and receiver operator curves (ROC) were used to compare
      outcomes between groups and evaluate sensitivity/specificity of CSP width as a
      marker of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Results: Twenty-nine cases of 22q11.2
      deletion and 64 cases of isolated conotruncal anomalies were matched to 186
      healthy controls. Cases with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome had significantly larger
      CSP widths (5.36 mm; SD=1.2) compared to those with isolated conotruncal
      anomalies (3.75 mm; SD=1.11) and healthy controls (2.93 mm; SD=0.57; p<0.0001).
      There was no difference in CSP width amongst those with 22q11.2 deletion
      irrespective of the presence/absence of a conotruncal anomaly (p=0.362), or by
      type of conotruncal anomaly (p=0.211). Using a CSP width cutoff >4.3 mm, fetuses 
      with 22q11.2 deletion can be accurately identified with good sensitivity (89.7%) 
      and specificity (84%). Conclusion: Fetuses with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have
      dilated CSPs when compared to those with isolated conotruncal anomalies or
      controls. Because CSP dilation can be evaluated during routine mid-pregnancy
      ultrasound using standard images of the fetal head, measurement could easily be
      incorporated to enhance prenatal diagnosis of this phenotypically diverse
      condition.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness of
      modified perineal reconstruction combined with anal sphincter repair in the
      treatment of obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). Methods: Twenty
      consecutive patients with an OASI who underwent modified perineal reconstruction 
      combined with anal sphincter repair in the Department of Colorectal and Anal
      Surgery of the First Hospital of Jilin University from October 2015 to September 
      2017 were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Anal function was evaluated
      using the Williams grade, the Wexner score, anorectal manometry, and transrectal 
      ultrasound. Results: Differences in both the Williams grade and the Wexner score 
      prior to operation and following surgery indicated that anal function had
      improved, and these differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). These 
      indices also showed further improvement six months after surgery as compared with
      values at one month, and again, these differences were statistically significant 
      (P < 0.05). In addition, anorectal manometry at six months following surgery
      showed statistically significant differences in the maximum anal resting
      pressure, maximum anal systolic pressure, and anal defecation pressure as
      compared with values prior to operation (P < 0.05). Postoperative endorectal
      ultrasound revealed that the anal sphincter presented with close imbricated
      overlapping. Conclusion: Modified perineal reconstruction combined with anal
      sphincter repair in the treatment of female perineal defect is associated with a 
      good clinical outcome, strengthening anal function, and reconstructing the
      perineum, and is a possible method for clinical treatment.

TI  - The Association of Modifiable Postresuscitation Management and Annual Case Volume
      With Survival After Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.
PG  - e0733
LID - 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000733 [doi]
AB  - It is not know if hospital-level extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation
      (ECPR) case volume, or postcannulation clinical management associate with
      survival outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To describe variation in postresuscitation
      management practices, and annual hospital-level case volume, for patients who
      receive ECPR and to determine associations between these management practices and
      hospital survival. DESIGN: Observational cohort study using case-mix adjusted
      survival analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients greater than or equal
      to 18 years old who received ECPR from the Extracorporeal Life Support
      Organization Registry from 2008 to 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Generalized 
      estimating equation logistic regression was used to determine factors associated 
      with hospital survival, accounting for clustering by center. Factors analyzed
      included specific clinical management interventions after starting extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO) including coronary angiography, mechanical unloading 
      of the left ventricle on ECMO (with additional placement of a peripheral
      ventricular assist device, intra-aortic balloon pump, or surgical vent),
      placement of an arterial perfusion catheter distal to the arterial return cannula
      (to mitigate leg ischemia); potentially modifiable on-ECMO hemodynamics (arterial
      pulsatility, mean arterial pressure, ECMO flow); plus hospital-level annual case 
      volume for adult ECPR. RESULTS: Case-mix adjusted patient-level management
      practices varied widely across individual hospitals. We analyzed 7,488 adults
      (29% survival); median age 55 (interquartile range, 44-64), 68% of whom were
      male. Adjusted hospital survival on ECMO was associated with mechanical unloading
      of the left ventricle (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.08-1.55; p = 0.005),
      performance of coronary angiography (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11- 1.61; p = 0.002),
      and placement of an arterial perfusion catheter distal to the return cannula (OR,
      1.39; 95% CI, 1.05-1.84; p = 0.022). Survival varied by 44% across hospitals
      after case-mix adjustment and was higher at centers that perform more than 12
      ECPR cases/yr (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.45; p = 0.015) versus medium- and
      low-volume centers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Modifiable ECMO management
      strategies and annual case volume vary across hospitals, appear to be associated 
      with survival and should be the focus of future research to test if these
      hypothesis-generating associations are causal in nature.

TI  - Baseline Anxiety and Depression and Risk for ICU Delirium: A Prospective Cohort
      Study.
PG  - e0743
LID - 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000743 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Anxiety and depression are common mental disorders in adults admitted
      to the ICU. Although depression increases postsurgical delirium and anxiety does 
      not, their associations with ICU delirium in critically ill adults remain
      unclear. We evaluated the association between ICU baseline anxiety and depression
      and ICU delirium occurrence. DESIGN: Subgroup analysis of a prospective cohort
      study. SETTING: Single, 36-bed mixed ICU. PATIENTS: Nine-hundred ninety-one ICU
      patients admitted with or without delirium between July 2016 and February 2020;
      patients admitted after elective surgery or not assessed for anxiety/depression
      were excluded. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTs: The Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire was administered at ICU admission to
      determine baseline anxiety and depression. All patients were assessed with the
      Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) q8h; greater than or equal to 1
      +CAM-ICU assessment and/or scheduled antipsychotic use represented a delirium
      day. Multivariable logistic and Quasi-Poisson regression models, adjusted for ICU
      days and nine delirium risk variables ("Pre-ICU": age, Charlson Comorbidity
      Index, cognitive impairment; "ICU baseline": Acute Physiology and Chronic Health 
      Evaluation-IV, admission type; "Daily ICU": opioid and/or benzodiazepine use,
      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, coma), were used to evaluate
      associations between baseline anxiety and/or depression and ICU delirium. Among
      the 991 patients, 145 (14.6%) had both anxiety and depression, 78 (7.9%) had
      anxiety only, 91 (9.2%) had depression only, and 677 (68.3%) had neither.
      Delirium occurred in 406 of 991 total cohort (41.0%) patients; in the baseline
      anxiety and depression group, it occurred in 78 of 145 (53.8%), in the anxiety
      only group, 37 of 78 (47.4%), in the depression only group, 39 of 91 (42.9%), and
      in the group with neither in 252 of 677 (37.2%). Presence of both baseline
      anxiety and depression was associated with greater delirium occurrence (adjusted 
      odds ratio, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.10-3.53; p = 0.02) and duration (adjusted risk ratio,
      1.62; 95% CI, 1.17-2.23; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline anxiety and depression 
      are associated with increased ICU delirium occurrence and should be considered
      when delirium risk reduction strategies are being formulated.

TI  - Comparison of Clinical Profiles and Mortality Outcomes Between Influenza and
      COVID-19 Patients Invasively Ventilated in the ICU: A Retrospective Study From
      All Paris Public Hospitals From 2016 to 2021.
PG  - e0737
LID - 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000737 [doi]
AB  - Studies comparing outcomes of ICU patients admitted for either COVID-19 or
      seasonal influenza are limited. Our objective was to describe baseline clinical
      profiles, care procedures, and mortality outcomes by infection status (influenza 
      vs COVID-19) of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU.
      DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Data were extracted from the 
      Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris database from September 1, 2016, to April
      20, 2021. It includes data from the 39 university hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of
      752 influenza adult patients and 3,465 COVID-19 adult patients received invasive 
      mechanical ventilation in one of the ICUs of the Paris area university hospitals,
      France. INTERVENTION: The characteristics and outcome by infection status were
      compared. Factors associated with mortality were assessed using Cox proportional 
      hazard models after controlling for potential confounders, including infection
      status. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The median age at admission to the ICU was
      67 (interquartile range [IQR], 57-77) and 63 yr (IQR, 54-71 yr) for influenza and
      COVID-19 patients, respectively. At ICU admission, COVID-19 patients were more
      frequently obese, more frequently had diabetes mellitus or high blood pressure,
      and were less likely to have chronic heart failure, chronic respiratory disease, 
      chronic kidney failure, or active cancer than influenza patients. The overall
      survival at 90 days was 57% for COVID-19 patients and 66% for influenza patients 
      (p < 0.001). In a multivariable Cox model, higher age, organ transplant, severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and chronic kidney failure
      were associated with shorter survival, whereas obesity and high blood pressure
      were associated with longer survival after invasive ventilation. CONCLUSIONS:
      COVID-19 and influenza patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU
      differed by many characteristics. COVID-19 patients showed lower survival
      independently of potential confounders.

TI  - Systematic Review of the "Pragmatism" of Pragmatic Critical Care Trials.
PG  - e0738
LID - 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000738 [doi]
AB  - To assess the pragmatism of published critical care randomized controlled trials 
      self-described as pragmatic using a validated tool. DATA SOURCES: Medical
      Literature Analysis and Retrieval Online database and PubMed interface from
      inception to November 1, 2021. STUDY SELECTION: We performed a systematic search 
      of randomized controlled trials evaluating interventions for critically ill
      adults that self-identified as pragmatic in title or abstract. DATA EXTRACTION:
      Reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction in
      duplicate; discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Pragmatism was assessed
      independently in duplicate by trained reviewers using the Pragmatic-Explanatory
      Continuum Indicator Summary 2 (PRECIS-2), a validated tool designed to represent 
      how explanatory/pragmatic a trial is on the pragmatic to explanatory continuum.
      Trials were scored in nine domains on a 5-point continuum (from 1 = very
      explanatory to 5 = very pragmatic). Discrepancies of greater than 2 points were
      adjudicated by consensus discussion. DATA SYNTHESIS: The search resulted in 284
      studies; 56 met eligibility criteria. Forty-one of the trials had a discrepancy
      in at least one domain that required consensus discussion, most commonly in
      domains of eligibility and follow-up. Twelve studies (21.4%) were scored as
      "overall pragmatic," defined as score of greater than 4 in five domains provided 
      the scores in the remaining domains were three. The overall PRECIS-2 score of
      self-identified pragmatic studies increased from 1995 to 2021 suggesting
      increasing pragmatism over time. Pragmatic trials were more likely to have a
      waiver of informed consent (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The number and pragmatism of 
      self-identified pragmatic trials have increased, particularly in the past decade.
      However, less than one-quarter of these trials that use the term pragmatic in
      title or abstract were retrospectively rated as pragmatic. Our results support
      the concept that trials are designed on a spectrum of pragmatic to explanatory.
      Advances in the design and reporting of critical care trials are needed to ensure
      their real-world applicability.
